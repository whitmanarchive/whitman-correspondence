   <p id="loc.01712_n1">1. Samuel Ward
      (1814–1884), the brother of Julia Ward Howe, co-edited <em>An Elementary Treatise on Algebra</em> (Philadelphia: Carey &amp; Lea,
      1832), was the author of <em>Lyrical Recreations</em> (New York
      and London: D. Appleton; Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1865), and was a lobbyist for
      various financiers during the Johnson and Grant administrations.<a href="#r1">[back]

      Louis Fitzgerald Tasistro (1808–1875?) came to the U.S. from Ireland as
      a young man. He edited a newspaper in New York and later had a brief career
      on the stage. Subsequently he was a translator for the State Department and
      a lecturer. He was the author of <em>Random Shots and Southern
         Breezes</em> (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1842) and translator of
      Louis-Phillipe-Albert d'Orléans, Compte de Paris' <em>History of the Civil War in America</em> (Philadelphia: J. H. Coates,
      1875). On April 26, 1872, Whitman inserted in the Washington <em>Daily Morning Chronicle</em> an appeal for "pecuniary
      assistance for a man of genius," who was not named. On the following day the
      <em>Chronicle</em> noted "prompt contributions" from,
      among others, Samuel Ward.<br><br>
      In the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., there are three
      receipts written by Whitman and signed by Tasistro. On April 26, 1872,
      Tasistro acknowledged $70. On April 29, 1872, he accepted an additional $25,
      and on May 14, 1872, $10. On August 3, 1872, in his own hand, Tasistro
      signed a receipt for $17. On the verso Whitman noted the total of $122:
      "also $10 more handed by W. W. to Mr. Tasistro." On October 24, 1872, Walt
      Whitman wrote: "also about $25 more in different sums since." See <em>Walt Whitman Review</em>, 7 (1961),
      14–16.<a href="#r2">[back]
