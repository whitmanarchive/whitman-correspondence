      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am having a better time here than I had my last visit.—The weather is very pleasant—pretty
      hot 
      during the middle of the day, but mornings &amp; nights perfect—No moonlight walks out
      beyond Uniontown 
      here—but I go on the river, &amp; cross to &amp; fro in the pilot house. Last night was beautiful—Saturday
      I spent at Coney Island—went in swimming—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Mother is only middling—has some pretty 
      bad spells with rheumatism—will break up here, &amp; go with my brother George, to Camden,
      N. J. in September.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you got a letter from me last Saturday, as I wrote you the day before. Pete,
      dear son, 
      if you should want any of your money, send me word. It is either $120 (or $130, I
      am not sure—but I have a memorandum in my desk at Washington)—I am feeling real well,
      &amp; hope you are too, my loving boy.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
