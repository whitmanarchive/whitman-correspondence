      form of verse, never reached him, or else he thought it unworthy of
      representation. In case of the latter, I should have been glad had he thought my
      name worthy of mention as a friend. But in case it was not received, I am going
      to give myself the pleasure of sending to your own self a copy of the verses I sent him
      that you may see I did not forget you. This is but an added nod to the effort I
      am always making to bring to you the friendly love of our American people.

         "Splendor of ended day floating and filling me."
         <br>Comes to my mind as I think of the hour
         <br>When our poet and friends will be lovingly drinking
         <br>The mystical cup of the seventy years' power.
         <br><br>
         Were I the man-of-war bird he has pictured us
         <br>Nothing could keep me from flying that way.
         <br>But, though absent in body, there's nothing can hinder
         <br>My tasting the joys of that festive birthday;
         <br><br>
         For on the swift wings of the ending day's splendor
         <br>My soul will glide in to drink deep the cup's wealth
         <br>Who knows but the poet's keen sense of pure friendship
         <br>Will feel, midst the joy, what I drink to his health!
         <br><br>
         Splendor of ended day
         <br>Be but the door
         <br>Opening the endless way—
         <br>Life evermore.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Elizabeth Porter Gould
      (1848–1906) was a Massachusetts writer and reformer who edited the
      collection <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/gems_intro.html"><em>Gems from Walt Whitman</em> (1889)</a>, a selection of
      poems from <em>Leaves of Grass</em> that she condensed to create
      short poetic "gems."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02232_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman. | Camden. | New Jersey | Mickle St. It is postmarked: Boston,
      Mass. | Dec 30 | [illegible]PM | 1889;
      Camden, N.J. | Dec 31 | 9 AM | 1889 | Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03027_n3">2. The notes and addresses that
      were delivered at Whitman's seventieth birthday celebration on May 31, 1889 in
      Camden, were collected and edited by Horace Traubel. The volume was titled <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em>, and it included a
      photo of Sidney Morse's 1887 clay bust of Whitman as the frontispiece. The book
      was published in 1889 by Philadelphia publisher David McKay.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03027_n4">4. For Whitman's seventieth
      birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
      the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
      (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.30.html">Tuesday, May 7, 1889</a>. The day was celebrated with a testimonial
      dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
      addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
      arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.02232_n2">5. Porter Gould has added a
      note following the heading "For May 31st 1889," which she has marked with an
      asterisk. The corresponding note refers to the title of the poem "Song at
      Sunset," which Porter Gould has written after the final lines of the
      poem.<a href="#r5">[back]
