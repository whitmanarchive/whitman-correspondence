   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00547_n11">1. This letter dates to
      July 8, 1868. "July 8" is in Louisa Van Velsor's Whitman's hand, and Richard
      Maurice Bucke dated the letter 1868; Edwin Haviland Miller agreed (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–75], 2:366). The year is consistent with her
      reference to a Thomas Nast cartoon in <em>Harper's
         Weekly</em>. In addition, July 8 fell on a Wednesday in 1868, the day of the
      week that Louisa wrote this letter.<br><br>
      Louisa used a superscript "th" with some regularity, but the placement is not
      consistent. She appears here to have written a superscript both before and
      after the number "8," but neither mark is clear.

   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00547_n2">4. Erysipelas is contagious and
      has symptoms of fever accompanied by skin inflammation with a deep red color. It
      is also known by the name St. Anthony's fire. George Washington Whitman suffered
      a serious bout of erysipelas (see Walt Whitman's  letter to William D. O'Connor).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00547_n3">5. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. George
      Washington Whitman's position as inspector for the Brooklyn Water Works became
      more tenuous in 1869 after the reorganization of the Brooklyn Board of Water
      Commissioners in April: Lane resigned after the new board was seated (see Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). Lane later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and
      served there as city engineer, and he again employed George to inspect pipe in
      Camden, New Jersey. For Walt Whitman's dealings with Lane, see his  letter to Jeff Whitman. For Lane's
      career, see "Moses Lane," <em>Proceedings of the American Society
         of Civil Engineers</em> (February 1882), 58.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00547_n12">7. Walt Whitman was proud of
      Dutch ancestry on his mother's side: "I may say I revel, even gloat, over my
      Dutch ancestry" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> ed. Jeanne Chapman and Robert MacIsaac [Carbondale: Southern
      Illinois University Press, 1992], <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/7/med.00007.1.html">7:1</a>).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00440_n3">8. Manahatta Whitman
      (1860–1886), known as "Hattie," was the daughter of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven years of her life in
      the same home with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was especially close to her
      grandmother. Hattie and her younger sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957) were
      both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00547_n4">9. See Thomas Nast, "Sickly
      Democrat," <em>Harper's Weekly</em>, July 11, 1868, 439. In
      Nast's cartoon, Salmon P. Chase (1808–1873), Chief Justice of the
      Supreme Court, is depicted as a physician who offers a sickly Democrat a
      medicinal draught that holds a stereotyped black figure as the "medicine," a
      reference to Chase's support for African American suffrage.<br><br>
      Louisa could refer to <em>Harper's Weekly</em> of "last" Sunday
      (July 11, 1868) in this July 8 letter because the weekly was post-dated by
      one week. Walt Whitman in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman reported receiving a
      letter, almost certainly this one, because he referred to the Copperhead
      Democratic ticket of Horatio Seymour and Montgomery Blair as "a bad dose of
      medicine" outside New York.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00547_n13">10. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      phrase "your place" refers to Walt Whitman's employment in the office of the
      attorney general. Before Henry Stanbery (1803–1881) resigned the office on
      March 12, 1868 to serve as counsel during the impeachment trial of President
      Andrew Johnson, Walt had served under Stanbery and his interim replacement
      Orville Browning (1806–1881). William M. Evarts (1818–1901)
      succeeded Browning (see Walt's 
      letter to Louisa).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00547_n5">11. The words "no more" are
      pressed together. The word that precedes "lame" is most likely "letter," as in
      "letter lame," but it could also be "little."<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00547_n6">12. 
      Jean, usually "Jenny" but here "Jinne," and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor had
      visited Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in Brooklyn earlier in the year (see
      Louisa Whitman's  letter). Walt
      Whitman the previous month had reported his regular visits to the O'Connors,
      "up to the O'Connors as usual last evening to tea" (see his  letter).<br><br>
      For a time Walt Whitman lived with William D. and Nelly O'Connor, who, with
      Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates
      during the Washington years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was
      the author of the pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. Jenny was
      the O'Connors' daughter. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r12">[back]
