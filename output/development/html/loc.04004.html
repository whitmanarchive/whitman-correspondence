   <p>Well, Hank dear boy, how are you standing it this hot summer? Eva<sup><a href="#n6107" id="r2">2</a></sup> I want you to write
      to me &amp; tell me. We have had it fearful hot &amp; tainted here for over seven
      weeks, but I am alive &amp; kicking yet—it is rainy to-day but warm
      yet—I shall drive down to your parents<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> in a day or two—(intended to have
      gone to-day)—Nothing very new with me, much the same old story—H
      G<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r4">4</a></sup> is here yet—the sculptor Morse<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r5">5</a></sup> also—I remain in good spirits but a pretty bad case
      bodily.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      were the parents of Whitman's young friend, Harry Stafford. Whitman often
      visited the family at their farm at Timber Creek in Laurel Springs (near
      Glendale), New Jersey, and was sometimes accompanied by Herbert Gilchrist; in
      the 1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby Glendale. For more,

      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
