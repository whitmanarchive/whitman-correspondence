   <p>I returned last evening from a week's stay at White Horse<sup><a href="#upa.00175_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—am feeling pretty well for me—heard of your call during my absence—Think of coming
      over <em>to-morrow, Thursday, afternoon</em> (say about 4)—As you will see by the enclosed card Mr Burroughs is to be in Phila: on a flying visit, &amp; expects to be at your house to-morrow afternoon at 5. So long till to-morrow—&amp; love to all—
