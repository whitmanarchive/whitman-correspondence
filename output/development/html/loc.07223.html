   <p>I received last evening the last pages of the book.<sup><a href="#loc.07223_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> I admire the Elias Hicks<sup><a href="#n0301" id="r3">3</a></sup> greatly and think I <u>understand the drift of
         it</u>. Do not think you have ever written any better prose. It is altogether an admirable
      &amp; most valuable piece—I shall write more at length another day, am rather
      crowded this morning I think I shall remodel my piece (that I sent Walsh<sup><a href="#n4283" id="r4">4</a></sup> of Lippencott) and make it into a review of the new vol.
      perhaps in that shape I shall get some "able Editor" to  print it—I have seen your little
      piece on Sheridan<sup><a href="#n4282" id="r5">5</a></sup> (one of them). You must be coming round
      finely to be able to write so vigorously. All well here. A little warmer today.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07223_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: LONDON | PM | AU 15 | 88 | CANADA; CAMDEN, N.J. | AUG | [illegible] | 8AM | 1888 | REC'D.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.07223_n3">2. Whitman was preparing <em>November Boughs</em> for publication and had friends reading
      proofs for the book. The final pages of the proofs contained Whitman's essay
      about Elias Hicks. For more on the publication and reception and reception of
      the book, see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0301">3. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker from Long
      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his
      influence on Whitman, see David S. Reynolds, <em>Walt Whitman's

   <p id="n4282">5. Philip Henry Sheridan
      (1831–1888) was a United States Army officer and general during the Civil
      War. Whitman published a poem in the <em>New York Herald</em> on
      August 12, 1888 about Sheridan's burial entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00086.html">Over and Through the Burial Chant</a>" (renamed "Interpolation Sounds"
      when incorporated into Leaves of Grass). See footnote 2595 in <em>Walt Whitman: Daybooks and Notebooks Vol. 2, 1881–1891</em>, ed.
