   <p>Dear Sir: I enclose $20 in further liquidation. I wish you would send me a copy of
      each of the printed sheets, by mail—as I suppose Alvord has printed them.
   </p>
   
   <p>Before I left New York I paid Bradstreet<sup><a href="#rut.00002_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> $20 in advance for binding the first 100.
   </p>
   
   <p>I rec'd the copyright &amp; receipt. I thank you for your kindness in getting the copyright.</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="rut.00002_n1">1. On
      April 1, 1865, Whitman signed a contract with Eckler to stereotype 500 copies
      for $254.00: "The workmanship is to be first class in every respect &amp; to be
      completed, &amp; the printed sheets delivered within one month from this date"
      (F. DeWolfe Miller, ed., <em>Drum-Taps</em> [Gainesville, FL:
      Scholars' Facsimiles &amp; Reprints, 1959], xxxv). The contract called for "one
      hundred &amp; twenty pages," but since the book contained only 72 pages, Eckler
      submitted on  a bill for $192.85, of which
      $138.00 had been paid. According to Whitman's notations on the statement, he
      paid $20.00 on April 26 and again on May 2, perhaps with this letter. Whitman
      sent another letter on  in answer to Eckler's
      request of May 1 that the balance be paid. On , Eckler issued a receipt for $34.85, and included a receipt from
      Coridon A. Alvord, printer, for the stereotype plates, which he had placed in
      his vault. On , Eckler had informed
      Whitman that the book was "now to press" and would "be ready for the Binders
      next Monday morning." For details on the printing history and organization of
      <em>Drum-Taps</em> see Ted Genoways, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00297.pdf">The

      payment, dated April 21 and signed by Abraham Simpson, is in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection; see also F. DeWolfe Miller, ed., <em>Drum-Taps</em> (Gainesville, FL: Scholars' Facsimiles &amp; Reprints,
