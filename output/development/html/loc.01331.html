   <p>I have been reading aloud your 'Whispers of Heavenly Death'<sup><a href="#n0695" id="r1">1</a></sup> this evening from the copy which you so kindly sent me in March 1876; and it has
      led me on to ask if you have any poems still unpublished in
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      the same vein of mystic realism.<sup><a href="#n0821" id="r2">2</a></sup> And if so, could you spare me one or two for the Magazine which I represent? I am
      sorry that but a trifle could be offered for them, as the Magazine has been neglected
      of late, and has only recently come into my hands, to be worked up again by labour
      &amp; patience
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I trust you are as well as you expect to be, and nearly as happy as you hope.</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0695">1. Whitman's poem "Whispers of Heavenly Death" was
      first published in 1868. After printing two sympathetic accounts of Whitman in
      their <em>Broadway Annual</em> (London), Routledge &amp; Sons
      requested "one or two papers or poems" from him on December 28, 1867 (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:263). Whitman sent "Whispers of Heavenly
      Death," which appeared in the October 1868 edition of the <em>Broadway</em>. For this periodical printing, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00051.html">Whispers of Heavenly Death</a>." The poem would later appear in the
      1871–1872 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0821">2. Kenningale Robert Cook
      (1845–1886) sought a contribution to the <em>Dublin
         University Magazine</em>, a journal he edited (Marion Meade, <em>Madame Blavatsky: The Woman Behind the Myth</em> [New York:
      G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1980], 390). Cook was also the author of <em>The Fathers of Jesus: A Study of the Lineage of the Christian Doctrine and
         Traditions</em> (London: K. Paul, Trench &amp; Co., 1886, 2 vols.). Cook
      first wrote to Whitman in February 1876, enclosing money for a copy of Whitman's
      complete poems. In that letter, Cook also notes that while he considered sending
      Whitman copies of his own poems, he decided against it as "they are very
      juvenile."<a href="#r2">[back]
