      <br></br><br></br>Mr. Whitman, Dear Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I suppose you will think that I have forgotten you long before this time but I have
      not, your kindness to me while in the hospital will never be forgotten by me.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have entirely recovered from my wounds long since and have been at work part of
      the time and attending commercial school.  I have been at work about six weeks, consequently
      my hand is not in very good condition for writing.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been promising myself to write to you ever since I returned home but have failed
      to keep my promise till now.
   </p>
   
   <p>I intend to go south in about two months and if I come that way I will stop and see
      you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I would like to know what chance I would have to go into business with a few hundred
      dollars capital.  If I can not go into anything there, what do you think of my going
      further south, say to Savannah.
   </p>
   
   <p>I want you when you write to tell me just what you think about it.</p>
   
   <p>I do not know as you will be much interested by receiving this letter from me but
      I would like to hear from you very much.  yours with respect.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The friendship of Whitman
      with this former soldier can be reconstructed from Wilson's letters in the
      Feinberg Collection. On July 18, 1869, Wilson recalled his confinement in Armory
      Square Hospital (see Whitman's ),
      "when your kind face &amp; pleasant words cheered the soldier Boys &amp; won
      their hearts. I never shall forget the first time you came in after David &amp;
      I got there. We Loved you from the first time we spoke to you." In Wilson's
      first letter, written on , he
      began: "I suppose you will think that I have forgotten you long before this time
      but I have not, your kindness to me while in the hospital will never be
      forgotten by me." After a lapse in the correspondence, he wrote on : "I wish if aggreable to yourself
      to keep up a regular correspondence between us . . . I think it will be of
      benefit to me morally and perhaps will not be of any detriment to you." In this
      letter he admitted that he had just discovered that Whitman was a poet. On
      January 27, 1867, he informed Whitman that he had been reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, but complained: "I wrote to you a year and more ago
      that I was married but did not receive any reply, so I did not know but you was
      displeased with it"; he concluded the letter: "I remain as ever your | Boy
      Friend | with Love | Benton H. Wilson." Whitman replied (lost), and sent William
      D. O'Connor's <em>The Good Gray Poet</em>, which Wilson
      acknowledged on February 3. On April 7, 1867, after he informed Whitman that his
      wife had gone to the hospital for her first confinement (the child was to be
      named Walt Whitman), he complained: "I am poor and am proud of it but I hope to
      rise by honesty and industry. I am a married man but I am not happy for my
      disposition is not right. I have got a good Woman and I love her dearly but I
      seem to lack patience or something. I think I had ought to live alone, but I had
      not ought to feel so." On April 21, Wilson acknowledged Whitman's reply of April
      12: "I do not want you to misunderstand my motives in writing to you of my
      Situation &amp; feelings as I did in my last letter or else I shall have to be
      more guarded in my letters to you. I wrote so because you wanted me to write how
      I was situated, and give you my mind without reserve, and all that I want is
      your advice and Love, and I do not consider it cold lecture or dry advice. I
      wish you to write to me just as you feel &amp; express yourself and advise as
      freely as you wish and will be satisfied." On September 15, Wilson wondered why
      Whitman had not replied. See also Whitman's letter to Benton H. Wilson from
      April 15, 1870 (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–69],
      1:182–184).
