   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00572_n1">1. This letter likely dates
      to December 18 or 19, 1863. It is possible, though unlikely, that it dates
      to as late as December 24, 1863.<br><br>
      This brief letter from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman is inscribed
      in the margins of George Washington Whitman's  letter from Camp Pittman, Kentucky. Louisa
      received the letter from George on the same day that she received Walt's
       letter, and she planned
      to forward George's letter after Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman had read
      it. Jeff probably read George's letter shortly after his return from the
      surveying trip that took him to Springfield, Massachusetts. Jeff's return
      from that surveying trip is estimated at December 18 or 19, 1863 because
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman noted that Jeff had visited the home of his
      sister-in-law Nancy McClure Whitman (his brother Andrew Jackson Whitman's
      widow) on December 19 or 20, 1863 (see Jeff's  letter to Walt; and see Mattie's December 21,
      1863 letter to Louisa in Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie:
         The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1971], 34–35).<br><br>
      Jeff in his late-December letter to Walt had yet to acquire the brief sketch
      of Walt from an article in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>,
      which is the subject of Louisa's note on George's letter (see Jeff's  letter to Walt). The more
      probable case is that Jeff was so busy that he was unable to write Walt the
      letter about acquiring a copy of the sketch in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, and Louisa took it upon herself to take care
      of the matter and forward George's letter after Jeff read it, probably on
      December 19 or 20, 1863. The less probable case is that Jeff's apology at
      month's end for not acquiring copies of the sketch could indicate that
      Louisa had continued to delay forwarding George's letter and had waited
      perhaps another week, until December 24 or 25, 1863. Based on Louisa's  letter to Walt, which
      mentions neither George nor the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>
      sketch, the matter of forwarding George's letter and the sketch to Walt were
      unlikely to remain matters of pressing concern to her, though Jeff had still
      to complete the task of acquiring copies.

   <p id="duk.00572_n3">3. Andrew Jackson Whitman
      (1827–1863) was Walter Whitman, Sr., and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son,
      and Walt's younger brother. He died on December 4, 1863. The brief sketch of
      Walt Whitman had appeared in the newspaper the previous day ("Personal," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, December 3, 1863, 3). Louisa's
      account of Andrew's death appears in her  letter to Walt. For more on Andrew, see Martin G.
      Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>

   <p id="duk.00572_n4">4. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman and his mother Louisa Van Velsor Whitman at first thought Brooklyn
      physician Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867), a close friend of the Whitman
      family, wrote the sketch of Walt Whitman. However, Jeff had several talks with
      Ruggles about placing his brother Jesse Whitman in an asylum in December, and he
      did not mention Ruggles's authorship in his next letter to Walt (see Jeff's  letter to Walt). Walt suspected
      that the sketch was written by Joseph Hayward, Jr. (1833–1890), a city
      editor from the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> who also had served
      as a war correspondent (see Walt's  letter to Louisa).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00572_n5">5. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      transcription is near verbatim: "Who is there in Brooklyn who doesn't know Walt.
      Whitman? Rough and ready, kind and considerate, generous and good, he was ever a
      friend in need, which is, after all, the only friend indeed. Walt is now in
      Washington, a volunteer nurse, going from hospital to hospital, and doing good
      every minute of his life. We hear of him at the bedside of the sick, the pallet
      of the wounded, the cot of the dying, and the pestilential ward. He writes
      letters home for disabled men, bathes the feverish brow of half-crazed soldiers,
      refreshes the parched lips of neglected sufferers, and attends with fidelity and
      tact to the thousand and one necessities of those who approach the gate of
      death. Surely such as he will find their reward here and hereafter" ("Personal,"
      <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, December 3, 1863, 3).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="duk.00575_n9">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
      adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
      he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
      St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Jeff
      Whitman. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta "Hattie"
      (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" (b. 1863). In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to join Jeff after he had assumed the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in 1867. For more on Mattie, see
      the introduction to Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r6">[back]
