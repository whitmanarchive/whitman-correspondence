      <br></br><br></br>Dear Wm. Stansberry,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will just write you a few lines off-hand. Your letter of May 14<sup><a href="#duk.00669_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> has come to hand to-day, reminding me of your being in Armory Square 
      Hospital &amp; of my visits there, &amp; meeting you, in '65. 
      Your writing, or something it has started, strangely, deeply touches me. It takes
      me back 
      to the scenes of ten years ago, in the war, the hospitals of Washington, the many
      wounded 
      bro't up after the battles, and the never-to-be told sights of suffering &amp; death. To think
      
      that the little gift &amp; word of kindness, should be remembered by you so long—&amp; that
      the kiss 
      I gave you amid those scenes, should be treasured up, &amp; as it were sent back to me
      after many years! 
      Dear Comrade—you do me good,<sup><a href="#duk.00669_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> by your loving wishes &amp; feelings to me in your letters.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you my love, &amp; to your dear children &amp; wife the same. As I write, you seem
      very dear to me too, 
      like some young brother, who has been lost, but now found. Whether we shall ever meet
      each other 
      is doubtful—probably we never will—but I feel that we should both be happy, if we
      could be together—(I find there are some that it is just comfort enough to be together,
      almost without any thing else)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I remain about the same in my sickness. I sleep &amp; eat pretty well—go about same, look
      stout &amp; red, 
      (though looking now <em>very</em> old &amp; gray, but that is nothing new)—weigh 185 now—am badly lamed 
      in my left leg, &amp; have bad spells, occasionally days, of feebleness, distress in head,
      &amp;c. 
      I think I shall get well yet, but may not. Have been laid up here a year doing nothing,
      
      except a little writing. As far as room, food, care, &amp;c. are concerned, I am well
      situated here—but <em>very lonesome</em>—have no near friends, (in the deepest sense) here at hand—my mother died 
      here a year ago—a sorrow from which I have never entirely recovered, &amp; likely never
      shall—she was an unusually noble, cheerful woman—very proud-spirited &amp; generous—am
      poor, 
      (yet with a little income, &amp; means, just enough to pay my way, with strict economy,
      
      to be independent of want)—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>"After the lapse of over 8 years," William
      Stansberry, a former soldier whom Whitman had met in Armory Square Hospital,
      wrote on , from Howard Lake,
      Minn., and recalled "the Blackbery [Jam?] you gave me &amp; all the kindness
      which you shown." After Whitman replied on April 27, 1874 (lost), Stansberry
      wrote again on , about the hospital
      visits. On , he thanked Whitman for
      his letter and "22 News 
      Pappers
      
      ." On , his wife informed
      Whitman of her husband's failing health and poverty and inquired about the
      possibility of a pension. Evidently in reply to another lost letter from
      Whitman, Stansberry asked on  for
      "the Lone of 65$" in order to return to West Virginia, where he expected to find
      witnesses to support his application for a pension. This was evidently the last
      letter in the correspondence. These letters are in the Trent Collection, Duke
      University. See also <em>The Complete Writings of Walt
         Whitman</em> [New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 10 vols., 4:134.
