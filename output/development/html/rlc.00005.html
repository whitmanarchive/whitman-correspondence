      <br></br><br></br>My dear Rudolf Schmidt,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#rlc.00005_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have rec'd yours of April 25. Having an opportunity by Mr. Clausen, who is journeying
      home to Denmark, I send you some books—another copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>—and a copy for Björnsen—(though he may not read English, I have wished to send him
      something—&amp; when he chances upon someone who reads English and Danish, I should be
      so glad to be communicated to him.)<sup><a href="#rlc.00005_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Your article in the <em>Ide</em> will soon be translated for me in full.<sup><a href="#rlc.00005_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> It is pronounced magnificent by those who can read it. I shall have much to say about
      it in my next.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you two or three humorous American works. The subject of American humor is
      very difficult to treat fully &amp; satisfactorily, even for a native. In the books I
      send, the great difficulty will be the slang, the American local idioms, &amp; the mis-spelling—all
      of which will certainly prove <em>chevaux-de-frise</em> making it impossible for any foreigner to penetrate the fun of them—Still I have
      thought it worth while to send them as (much more than the comic &amp; pictorial papers)
      <em>idiomatic, native specimens</em>, (as minerals or insects)—<sup><a href="#rlc.00005_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>American humor is yet in its nebulous state—unformed—<em>struggling to be born</em>. Some traits already appear—it is very grim, loves exaggeration, &amp; has a certain
      tartness &amp; even fierceness—I will endeavor to gather something more for you on this
      business—&amp; write you again—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am going soon to a College about 500 miles from here to deliver a commencement poem<sup><a href="#rlc.00005_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup>—it will be published, forming part of a little book—which I will send you—During
      June I shall be home with my mother in Brooklyn, N.Y.—then return again here—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="rlc.00005_n1">1. Rudolf Schmidt, editor of
      <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em>, wrote to Walt Whitman on
      October 19, 1871: "I intend to write an article about yourself and your writings
      in the above named periodical which is very much read in all the Scandinavian
      countries. . . . I therefore take the liberty to ask you, if you should not be
      willing to afford some new communications of yourself and your poetry to this
      purpose" (Library of Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00005_n2">2. 
      Carl F. Clausen, whom Schmidt termed "my old friend and countryman,"
      corresponded with Schmidt after he left Denmark in 1860; see <em>Orbis Litterarum</em>, 7 (1949), 34–39. The city
      directory in 1870 listed him as a draughtsman and in 1872 as a patent agent.
      He died of consumption in the middle 1870s; see Thomas Biggs Harned
      Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #108.<br><br>
      Björnstjerne Björnson (1832–1910), Norwegian poet, dramatist,
      and novelist, was co-editor of Schmidt's journal. In his letter of , Schmidt observed: "Hans
      Christian Andersen would perhaps not make you very great joy, if you did
      know him personally. Björnson would be your man." Schmidt later altered
      his opinion of Björnson; see notes to Whitman's  letter to Schmidt.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00005_n4">3. Schmidt's review of
      Whitman appeared in <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em> in March
      1872. Whitman included excerpts from it in an appendix to <em>As a
         Strong Bird on Pinions Free</em> (1872), 7–8. It was reprinted in
      entirety in <em>In Re Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1893), ed. Horace L. Traubel, Richard Maurice Bucke, and Thomas B.
      Harned, 231–248.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00005_n5">4. On , Schmidt made a request: "Will you do me a service? I
      should like to write an article on 'American fancy' contrasting the grotesque
      humor that is scattered with no pretension in your newspapers with the humor of
      Luther and Shakespeare . . . . Could you not find for me about a dozen jokes of
      this sort." It is not known what books Whitman sent to Schmidt. See also
      Whitman's letter to Schmidt of .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00005_n6">5. Whitman recited "As a
      Strong Bird on Pinions Free" (later "Thou Mother with Thy Equal Brood") at
      Dartmouth College on June 26, 1872. Evidently, a student organization hoped to
      annoy the faculty by inviting Whitman to Dartmouth, a seat of New England
      sobriety and conservatism; see Bliss Perry, <em>Walt Whitman</em>
      (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., 1906), 203–205. The poem appeared in
      the  edition of the <em>New York Herald</em>.<a href="#r5">[back]
