   <p>Your welcome postcard of 19th came to hand yesterday.<sup><a href="#loc.07215_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> You seem to be still "among the
      midling." I wish I could hear of you rallying a little more. The book<sup><a href="#loc.07215_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      (I have proofs
      to p. 92) seems to rather hang fire. I wish you 
      wd 
      
       hand over the balance of the M.S. to Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup> to do
      the best he could with it. It is not good for you to be trying at it and
      failing—you ought to let it go and forget
      it as soon as possible. In your present state you would not do any good
      with the Hicks<sup><a href="#loc.07215_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> if you did go through it. Let Traubel have it
      and tell him to alter nothing except where necessary to make  sense and connection, and let it be
      printed and the book brought to an end. We are having warm rainy weather here, all
      crops look well. We are having a splendid year. Just now raspberries and currants
      are plentiful with us. We had our first <u>new potatoes</u> out
      of our garden today (Your potatoes are <u>old</u>
      before this). In a few minutes I am going out
      to Catholic Chapel—(we had protestant service this morning). There is nothing
      narrow about us here, we have all kinds of clergymen and services turn about. We are
      all well, I am keeping first-rate. You seem to have had a cool summer so far—I
      hope it may keep on so

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="loc.07215_n3">5. Elias Hicks
      (1748–1830) was a traveling Quaker preacher and anti-slavery activist from
      Long Island, New York. Whitman's essay on Hicks was the concluding piece in <em> November Boughs.</em> For more on Hicks, see Henry Watson
      Wilbur, <em>The Life and Labors of Elias Hicks</em> (Philadelphia:
      Friends' General Conference Advancement Committee, 1910).<a href="#r5">[back]
