      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been thinking much of you lately &amp; wondering where you were (for I heard some
      time since that you had left Washington), when the N.Y. Times came, with your long
      &amp; interesting communication.  I do not yet, from reading that, understand very well
      where you are, &amp; I send this at a venture.  If this reaches you, please let meknow your address, &amp; I will try to send you something to help along your good work.
      I sent you, some time last summer, by private hands, a copy of "Great Expectations"
      &amp; two dollars in money, but could never learn that they reached you:  did they?  How
      are you now?
   </p>
   
   <p>A great change has taken place in my life since I saw you.  My dearest friend has
      left me, leaving in her place a little boy, noweleven months old.—A superb little fellow (although I say it); &amp; in him I have great
      comfort.
   </p>
   
   <p>I went three times to find Dr. 
      LeBarren
      
       Russell, with your note in my hand, but failing each time, I gave him up<sup><a href="#loc.00874_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am not trying to withdraw from the arena of popular literature; only the necessity
      of coining a livelihood has kept me in it so long.  I feel that, if I live frugally
      ' sincerely, and do not use up mymental energies in rapid writing I may be able to do something excellent.  I am about
      getting out a volume of poems,—or, as you would say, prettinesses.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Townsend Trowbridge
      was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
      Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
      Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
      Eldridge edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He again met Whitman
      in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Secretary Chase in order to
      gather material for his biography, <em>The Ferry Boy and the
         Financier</em> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described their meetings
      in <em>My Own Story, with recollections of noted persons</em>
      (Boston: Houghton and Mifflin, 1903), 360–401. On December 11, Trowbridge
      had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending Whitman; see the . Though
      Trowbridge was not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to O'Connor in 1867: "Every
      year confirms my earliest impression, that no book has approached the power and
      greatness of this book, since the Lear and Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A.
      Coleman, "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <em>American Literature</em>,
      23 [1951–52], 327). For Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Rowman
      and Littlefield, 1961], 3:506. See also Coleman, "Trowbridge and Whitman," <em>Publications of the Modern Language Association of America
         [PMLA]</em>, 63 (1948): 262–273. For several weeks in 1863, Trowbridge
      stayed with Whitman in Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William
      D. O'Connor.

      (1814–1819) was a Boston physician who was well acquainted with Ralph
