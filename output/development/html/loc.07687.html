      One of the outlets for these dauntless spirits has long been the quest for the North
      Pole.
      Whether its discovery is of sufficient value to science to warrant the tremendous
      hardships and risks to be run is 
      not the question. It is a fruitful field for harrowing disaster, hence its attraction
      to the venturous. Next year there
      will be another attempt made to penetrate its frozen mysteries, this time by Dr. Nansen,
      a Norwegian, whose journey
      across Greenland last summer will furnish interesting reading when his book, which
      he is writing, is finished.
      His plan of campaign is bold and daring. He will ascend the east coast to a higher
      point, if possible, than the 
      German and Lockwood expeditions, after corssing Greenland in its broaaded part, starting
      from the west coast settlements.
      By this route, he will practically have completed the mapping of Greenland's coast
      line. Reaching the highest point possible
      on the Greenland coast, he will strike out over the frozen sea for the pole, severing
      all connections, and wasting no
      time in establishing bases of supplies. He has taken for his motto the old Norse proverb:
      "There is before us only heaven or hell,"
      and says that he expects it will be the North Pole or death. many well-equipped expedictions
      have been sent into these regions,
      but none have gained their ends. The elaborate preparations that were made for disaster
      in establishing a line of retreat exhausted
      their energies too soon. It would seem that a flying expedition like that propsed
      by Nansen might penetrate farther north than the former 
      cumbrous ones. The scheme is backed by $100,000 capital, to which Mr. Gamel, whose
      name is already associated with arctic exploration, 
      is the chief subscriber.</span><br><br>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07887_n3">2.  Whitman was thinking of
      printing a select group of photos on uniform cards and arranging them, as he
      writes here, in "a good handsome fitting envelope (? perhaps album)." At this
      time he even wrote up instructions to the printer specifying a run of 200 copies
      with gilt labeling and the title <em>Pictures from life of
         WW.</em> The project, like many others in Whitman's final years, was never
      completed (though a smaller edition of six portraits in a ribbon-tied envelope
      did appear in 1889).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0852f">3. George Stafford was the father of Harry 
      Stafford, a young man that Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. George and his wife
      Susan
      were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey,
      where Whitman visited them on several occasions. For more on Whitman and the
      Staffords, see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>" <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n7508">4. Edward Bertz(1853—1931),
      also spelled "Eduard," was a German writer and translator from Potsdam, who
      became involved with social democracy movements and signed a petition against
      the criminalization of homosexuality in Germany. Bertz, a
      novelist, philologist, and self-declared sexual researcher, also published an article
      in 1905,
      positing that Whitman was a (sexually inactive) homosexual
      in the yearbook of the <em>Wissenschaftlich-Humanitäre
         Komitee</em>. For more about Bertz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_176.html">Bertz, Eduard (1853–1931)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">6. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n0625">7. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0273">8. Sir Edmund William Gosse (1849–1928), English
      poet and author of <em>Father and Son</em> (a memoir published in
      1907), had written to Whitman on : "I can but thank you for all that I have learned from you, all the
      beauty you have taught me to see in the common life of healthy men and women,
      and all the pleasure there is in the mere humanity of other people" (see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.65.html">Friday, June 1, 1888</a>). Gosse reviewed <em>Two
         Rivulets</em> in "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/rivulets/anc.00075.html">Walt Whitman's New Book</a>," <em>The Academy</em>, 9 (24
      June 1876), 602–603, and visited Whitman in 1885 (see Whitman's letter
      inviting Gosse to visit on  and
      <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–1977], 3:384 n80). In a letter to
      Richard Maurice Bucke on , Whitman
      characterized Gosse as "one of the amiable conventional wall-flowers of
      literature" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). For more about Gosse, see Jerry F.
      King, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_112.html">Gosse, Sir Edmund (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="loc.07687_n2">9. Kennedy on  called Whitman's attention to
