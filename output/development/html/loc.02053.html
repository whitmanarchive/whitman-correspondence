      <br></br><br></br>My dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How best can I introduce myself to you? How can I make myself known + liked by you
      who so well-known and loved by me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When we call on folks + wish to make a good impression we don our best clothes, make
      our best bow tell our politest lie + the thing's done.
   </p>
   
   <p>But to you, who likes naked flesh better than broadcloth, a warm grasp, a close
      embrace better than a fancy bow, the truth harsh and sonorous better than tinkling
      lies—to you I can't simper and smirk.
   </p>
   
   <p>I love you! I claim you for a friend! I hold you tight! sometimes you strangely elude
      me! A few times you speak unkindly, worse you speak sometimes in an unknown tongue
      but yet you comfort and cheer me!
   </p>
   
   <p>I read your "Specimen Days"<sup><a href="#n4121" id="r1">1</a></sup> first and liked them. I liked the
      chatty, shrewd kindhearted old friend who chaperoned me through the war + all over
      the States. And then I read the Leaves of Grass and met my dearest friend! Didn't
      and don't yet half understand it all except that it breathes + lives + like all
      things that live and breath it has much of mystery + miracle about it all through.
      (After its only dead things that are dissectable)
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Many things more I want to say but haven't words for now. Little things are the
      easiest to say always and of those I have but few for Walt Whitman. I will write
      again if my disjointed rhapsodies are bearable and I hope to come down and see you
      very shortly if your health permits you to see people.
   </p>
   
   <p>And now dear friend and teacher have I spoken at all into words that are clear? If
      so
      Walt Whitman knows his

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4121">1. The first issue of Whitman's <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em> was published by the
      Philadelphia firm of Rees Welsh and Company in 1882. The second issue was
      published by David McKay. Many of the autobiographical notes, sketches, and
      essays that focus on the poet's life during and beyond the Civil War had been
      previously published in periodicals or in <em>Memoranda During the
         War</em> (1875–1876).
