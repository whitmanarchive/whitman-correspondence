   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00178_n3">1. This letter dates to June 15
      or 16?, 1868. Neither the executors nor Edwin Haviland Miller dated this letter
      (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:366). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman identified
      the day of the week as Tuesday, and the letter probably dates to June 15, 1868.
      This letter must follow Walt Whitman's  letter, which she received on June 9, a Tuesday. However, because
      Louisa had received Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's June 8, 1868 letter from
      St. Louis, this letter dates no earlier than June 15, 1868. June 15 is also
      consistent with Thomas Jefferson Whitman's recent departure from Brooklyn to
      return to St. Louis. Louisa acknowledged Walt's "tuesday letter," so she may
      have erred on the day of the week.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n3">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00178_n17">3. Walt Whitman's June 15 or
      16, 1868 letter is not extant. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's designation of Walt's
      letter as the "tuesday letter" may be an error, as she dated her own letter
      Tuesday. Edwin Haviland Miller did not list the letter Louisa received among
      Walt's lost letters (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:361).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00178_n2">4. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      had been annoyed for some time with missing letters: "it seems hard to get
      honest people in the post offices" (see her  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00176_n12">5. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      refers to the <em>Illustrated Chicago News</em>, a periodical
      published by A. M. Farnum and C. A. Church that began a brief run on April 24,
      1868 (see Frank W. Scott and Edmund Janes James, ed., <em>Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois, 1814–1879</em> [Springfield:
      Illinois State Historical Library, 1910], 92).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="tex.00178_n5">9. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
      adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
      he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
      St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      On June 4, 1868, Jeff began a trip from St. Louis to Pittsburgh, where
      engines were manufactured, and he intended to stop in Brooklyn before his
      return to St. Louis (see Martha Mitchell Whitman's letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman, June 8, 1868, in Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1971], 54).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">10. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00619_n6">11. Jessie Louisa "Sis" Whitman
      (1863–1957) was the younger daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman,
      Walt Whitman's brother, and his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. Jessie
      Louisa inherited the nickname "Sis" after older sister Manahatta became "Hattie"
      and was sometimes called "Duty," but Walt often called her by the nickname
      "California." <a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">12. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00518_n3">13. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. The
      connection between Lane and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, who had served
      under Lane before accepting the position of Chief Engineer at the St. Louis
      Water Works, led to George Washington Whitman's employment as a pipe inspector
      in Brooklyn. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in her  letter reported Jeff Whitman's confidence that George's
      connection to Lane offered assurance of stable employment. George's position
      with the Brooklyn Water Works became more tenuous in 1869 after the
      reorganization of the Brooklyn Board of Water Commissioners in April: Lane
      resigned after the new board was seated (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman). Lane later designed and
      constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city engineer, and he
      again employed George to inspect pipe in Camden, New Jersey ("Moses Lane," <em>Proceedings of the American Society of Civil Engineers</em>
      [February 1882], 58).<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00467_n1">14. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter.<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00178_n19">15. Two men known only as
      Smith, a carpenter, and French, a mason, were George Washington Whitman's
      partners in building houses on speculation. Walt Whitman described Smith as "a
      natural builder and carpenter (practically and in effect) architect," and he
      advised John Burroughs that Smith was an "honest, conscientious, old-fashioned
      man, a man of family . . . . youngish middle age" (see Walt's  letter to John Burroughs).<a href="#r15">[back]
