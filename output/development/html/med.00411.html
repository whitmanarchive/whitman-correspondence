      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Mr. Tennyson:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This morning's paper has a vague sort of an item about your coming to America, or
      wanting to come, to view the working of our institutions, etc. Is there anything in
      it? I hope so, for I want more and more to meet you and be with you. Then I should
      like to give my explanations and comments of America and her shows, affairs, persons,
      doings, off-hand, as you witness them, and become puzzled, perhaps, dismayed by them.
      America is at present a vast seething mass of varied material human and other, of
      the richest, best, worst, and plentiest kind. Wealthy inventive, no limit to food,
      land, money, work, opportunity, smart and industrious citizens, but (though real and
      permanently politically organized by birth and acceptance) without fusion or definite
      heroic identity in form and purpose or organization, which can only come by native
      schools of great ideas—religion, poets, literature<sup><a href="#med.00411_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—and will surely come, even through the measureless crudity of the States in those
      fields so far, and to-day.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The lesson of Buckle's books<sup><a href="#med.00411_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> on civilization always seemed to me to be that the preceding main basis and continual
      <em>sine qua non</em> of civilization is the eligibility to, and certainty of boundless products for feeding,
      clothing, and sheltering everybody, infinite comfort, personal and inter-communication
      and plenty, with mental and ecclesiastical freedom, and that then all the rest, moral
      and esthetic, will take care of itself. Well, the United States have secured the requisite
      bases, and must now proceed to build upon them.<sup><a href="#med.00411_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I send you by same mail with this, a more neatly printed copy of my "Leaves"; also
      "Dem. Vistas."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of last fall<sup><a href="#med.00411_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> reached me at the time. Have you forgotten that you put a promise in it, to send
      me your picture when "you could lay hands on a good one?"<sup><a href="#med.00411_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been in Brooklyn and New York most of the past winter and current spring, visiting
      my aged dear mother, near eighty. Am now back here at work. Am well and hearty. I
      have received two letters from you, July 12 and September 22, of last year. This is
      the second letter I have written to you.<sup><a href="#med.00411_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> My address is: Solicitor's Office, Treasury, Washington, D. C., United States. Write
      soon, my friend. Don't forget the picture.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00411_n1">1. Edwin Haviland Miller
      derived his transcription of this letter from Thomas Donaldson, <em>Walt Whitman the Man</em> (New York: Francis P. Harper, 1896),
      224–226; and Emory Holloway, ed., <em>Walt
         Whitman—Complete Poetry &amp; Selected Prose and Letters</em> (London:
      Nonesuch Press, 1938), 1006–1007.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00411_n2">2. Here Walt Whitman
      summarizes one of his major points in <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00411_n3">3. Henry Thomas Buckle
      (1821–1862), English historian and author of <em>The History
         of Civilization in England</em> (1857, 1861).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00411_n4">4. Whitman copied this
      paragraph almost verbatim from the preface to <em>As a Strong Bird
         on Pinions Free</em> (1872), which is dated May 31, 1872; see <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: G.P.
      Putnam's Sons, 1902], 5:188–189.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="med.00411_n6">6. Tennyson sent his picture
      in May 1872. The envelope of this missing letter was endorsed by Walt Whitman:
      "(from Tennyson with picture)." The postmark reads: Yarmouth | B | My 23 | (?) 2
      | (?) (Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript
      Library).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00411_n7">7. The first letter is lost;
      the extant correspondence begins with Tennyson's  letter to Whitman.<a href="#r7">[back]
