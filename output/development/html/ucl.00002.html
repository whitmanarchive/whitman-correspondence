   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="ucl.00002_n1">1. Orville Hickman Browning
      (1806–1881) completed the unexpired term of Stephen A. Douglas after his
      death in 1861. Defeated for re-election in 1862, he established a law firm in
      Washington, and later actively supported President Johnson, who appointed him
      Secretary of the Interior in 1866. Browning was appointed acting Attorney
      General on March 12, 1868. At the conclusion of Johnson's administration, he
      returned to private law practice.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="ucl.00002_n2">2. James Michael Cavanaugh
      (1823–1879) was a member from Montana of the House of Representatives from
      1865 to 1871.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="ucl.00002_n3">3. With this letter is a
      twenty-page document in which Walt Whitman summarized the affidavits alleging
      malpractice and the Judge's defense of his conduct. Although the case was
      apparently never brought to trial, Munson resigned on October 31, 1868. For an
      account of the affair and a digest of Walt Whitman's report, see Dixon Wecter,
      "Walt Whitman as Civil Servant," <em>PMLA</em>, 58.4 (December
      1943), 1094–1109.<a href="#r3">[back]
