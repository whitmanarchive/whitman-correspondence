      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>How has the winter passed with you I wonder? Me it has
      imprisoned very much with bronchial &amp; asthmatic troubles—and the four
      walls of the house &amp; the ceiling seem to close in upon one's spirit as well as
      one's body, all too much. I hope you have been able to wend to and fro daily on the
      great ferry boats &amp; enjoy the beautiful broad river &amp; the sky &amp; the
      throngs of people as of old—you are in my thoughts as constantly as ever,
      though I have been so silent. Percy<sup><a href="#n2000" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; his wife<sup><a href="#loc.05902_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; the little son spent some weeks with us at
      Christmas &amp; now they have taken a house quite near, into which they will be
      moving in a week or two. I can't tell you what a dear, affectionate, reasonable,
      companionable little fellow Archie is—now six years old. Perhaps you will have
      seen in the American papers that Sidney Thomas, the cousin with whom Percy was
      associated in the discovery of the Basic process, is dead<sup><a href="#loc.05902_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—he spent his strength too freely—wore himself out at 35—he was
      much loved by all with whom he had to do. His mother &amp; sister have been watching
      &amp; hoping against hope &amp; taking him to warm climates, he himself full of
      hope—the mind bright and active to the last—&amp; now he is
      gone—&amp; his eldest brother died only two months before him.—I cannot
      help grieving over public affairs too—never in my lifetime has old England
      been in such a bad way—no honest &amp; capable man seemingly to take the
      helm—&amp; what Carlyle<sup><a href="#n0139" id="r4">4</a></sup> was fond of describing as the
      attempt to guide the ship by the shouts of the bystanders on shore—the
      newspapers &amp;c. prospering very ill. A government that tries perpetually how to
      do it and how not to do it at the same moment! The best comfort is that I do not
      think there is any, the smallest sign, of deterioration in the English race; so we
      shall pull through somehow, after tremendous disasters. How many things should I
      like to sit and chat with you about, dear Walt—above all to see you again! I
      could not get my article into any of the magazines I most wished. I believe it is
      coming out in <em>To-Day</em>. Giddy<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r5">5</a></sup> was so
      pleased at your sending her a paper—a very capital article too it is of Miss
      Kellogg.<sup><a href="#n0186" id="r6">6</a></sup> I was interested also in a little paragraph I
      found about Pullman town, near Chicago, which confirmed my suspicion that it was not
      a thing with healthy roots—but only a benevolent despotism. I am seeing a good
      deal of your socialists just now—&amp; I confess that though they mean well, I
      think they have less sense in their heads than any people I ever saw.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am going to pay a little visit to those friends (friendliest of friends) who live
      on the lonely top of a heath-covered hill—with such an outlook, such wooded
      slopes and broad valleys—and the storms travelling up hours before they
      arrive—such sweeps of sunshine too!—&amp; they mean to drive me about
      till I am quite strong again. So the next letter I write, dear Friend, shall be more
      cheery. I am afraid to look back lest this one should read too grumbly to send. I
      don't feel grumbly however—only shut in. Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r7">7</a></sup> has been
      working hard at getting up an exhibition here to help along our Public Library. It
      is so very hard to stir up anything like public spirit &amp; unity of action in
      London or its suburbs—I suppose because of its vastness—&amp; alas! also
      the social cliques &amp; gentilities &amp; snobbishnesses.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Good-bye, dearest Walt, with love from all.
      <br></br>Anne Gilchrist.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
