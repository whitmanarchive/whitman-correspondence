      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend Susan Stafford
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I should like to come down &amp; see you &amp; see George,<sup><a href="#n0852c" id="r1">1</a></sup> but I
      am quite poorly &amp; it has been such hot weather—I am quite concerned about
      him<sup><a href="#upa.00220_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; w'd wish to help somehow—If you w'd wish a little money I can let
      you have it, as I can spare it—or if there is any thing George would like that
      I c'd get up here, you write me, &amp; it w'd be a pleasure to me to get it—I
      send George my love &amp; the same to you all—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).
