   <p>. . . Since coming here I have often thought of what you told me when I said to you
      I am certain I will come back to Washington. you said to me then that a gret many of the boys had said the same but none had returned. I am sorry it is so but
      after I had thought it over I concluded it would be better for me to go into some
      business that would be a periminent thing.
