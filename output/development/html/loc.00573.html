      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I received your note this a.m. and I was very very much pleased to hear from you.
      I am right glad to hear your mission to Boston has terminated so successfully.<sup><a href="#loc.00573_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> I hope to God it may be not only a success as regards its typography, appearance
      and real worth, but also pecuniarily a success. For you know, "A well filled pocket,
      now &amp; then, is relished by the best of men."<sup><a href="#loc.00573_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> Walt, I hope you will be home soon. I want to see you very much indeed. I have never
      thought more frequently about you than during the time you have been in Boston. Make
      it your business to call and see me as soon as you arrive in New York, and we can
      make an appointment to pass some hours together. As I have much, very much to talk
      to you about. Robt and Mrs. Cooper<sup><a href="#loc.00569_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> send their love, Yours truly, Fred.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Fred Vaughan was a young
      Irish stage driver with whom Whitman had an intense relationship during the late
      1850's. For discussion of Vaughan's relationship with Whitman, see Jonathan Ned
      Katz, <em>Love Stories: Sex between Men before Homosexuality</em>
      (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001), 123–132; Charley Shively,

         Camerados</em> (San Francisco: Gay Sunshine Press, 1987), 36–50; Ed
      Folsom and Kenneth M. Price, <em>Re-Scripting Walt Whitman: An

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00573_n2">1. Shively writes that "Whitman
      went to Boston in the spring of 1860 to proofread and put the final touches on
      the third edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>." See <em>Calamus Lovers: Walt Whitman's Working-Class Camerados.</em>

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00573_n3">2. Vaughan plays here with the
      popular proverb "A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men"
      (anonymous).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00569_n4">3. Robert "Bob" Cooper and his
      mother were Vaughan's roommates after Vaughan left Whitman's Classon Avenue
      apartment.<a href="#r3">[back]
