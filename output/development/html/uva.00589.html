   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Jacob Klein (b. 1845) was a lawyer and, later, a Judge of the
      Circuit Court in St. Louis. Klein was born in Germany, but arrived in the United
      States with his parents in 1851; the family settled in St. Louis the following
      year. He was educated in St. Louis public schools and at Harvard Law School. He
      practiced law in St. Louis until he was elected Judge of the Circuit Court, and
      he also served as a member of the faculty at the St. Louis Law School (A. J. D.
      Stewart, "Jacob Klein, Saint Louis," <em>The History of the Bench
         and Bar of Missouri</em> [St. Louis, MO.: The Legal Publishing Company,
      1898], 247–249).

      pirated 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, in <em>The Critic</em> on June 2. (Papers of Walt Whitman [MSS 3829],
