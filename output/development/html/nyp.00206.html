      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Jeff,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#nyp.00206_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>By Mother's letter I have heard about the moving &amp; the new quarters—Mother says that
      she is glad they are no worse, under all the circumstances. I enclose an envelope
      to mother, with a little money in it. As you see, I am still in the same place, with
      easy times enough, &amp; a good place as I could expect. The Attorney General<sup><a href="#nyp.00206_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> is absent now in Kentucky. There is not much work. I can't tell whether I shall keep
      on here, or not. There is nothing at present that looks like a change—I feel quite
      well this spring—but a clerk's life here is not very interesting—I went down last
      Thursday to Mt Vernon, 16 miles down the Potomac—I think it is the pleasantest spot
      &amp; farm I ever saw—went through the house &amp; grounds &amp;c—I was very glad I went—Yesterday
      we had the funeral here of a man you must have seen mentioned in the papers, old Count
      Gurowski. I have been very well acquainted with him since I have lived here—he was
      a strange old man, a great lord in his own country, Poland, owned 30,000 serfs &amp; great
      estates—an exile for conspiring against the government—he knew every thing &amp; growled
      &amp; found fault with everybody—but was always very courteous to me, &amp; spoke very highly
      of me in his book, his "Diary," printed last winter—his funeral was simple but very
      impressive—all the big radicals were there<sup><a href="#nyp.00206_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>The fight between Congress &amp; the President is still going on—I think the President
      is rather afraid of going too far against Congress, for Stevens &amp; the rest of 'em
      are very determined.<sup><a href="#nyp.00206_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>My hospitals are dwindled down to a small force—but there are plenty of cases to occupy
      me a couple of visits a week—I always go Sunday, &amp; sometimes in the middle of the
      week—Julius Mason<sup><a href="#nyp.00206_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> is here in barracks yet—Jeff, I wish I could now &amp; then be home &amp; see you all, even
      if was only a couple of hours—
   </p>
   
   <p>Give my best respects to Mr. Lane,<sup><a href="#nyp.00206_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> and the Doctor<sup><a href="#nyp.00206_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—I send my love to Mat<sup><a href="#nyp.00206_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> &amp; the little girls.<sup><a href="#nyp.00206_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> Write &amp; tell me all about home affairs, &amp; how George<sup><a href="#nyp.00206_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> is getting along—dear old Mother, as she gets older &amp; older, I think about her every
      day &amp; night—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

      Whitman (1833-1890), Walt's brother.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00206_n2">2. Henry Stanbery
      (1803–1881) was appointed Attorney General on July 23, 1866, and served
      until March 12, 1868, when he resigned to serve as President Johnson's chief
      counsel in the impeachment proceedings. When, at the conclusion of the trial,
      Johnson renominated Stanbery, the Senate refused to confirm him. Failing
      eyesight—to which Whitman referred in letters from  and —forced Stanbery to retire from legal practice in 1878. Speaking to
      Horace Traubel in 1888, Whitman affirmed his fondness for Stanbery (<em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard &amp;
      Company, 1906–1996], 3:156).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00206_n3">3. Count Adam Gurowski
      (1805–1866), a Polish exile, published an eccentric three-volume <em>Diary</em> (Boston: Lee and Shepard, 1862–1866), a
      day-by-day account of the war written with a marked partiality toward extreme
      abolitionists. The Count was a colorful figure: he covered his lost eye with a
      "green blinder," and "he had a Roman head . . . a powerful topknot, in and out:
      people always stopped to look at him" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 3:79, 96). O'Connor, who
      apparently Englished Gurowski's manuscripts (see the letter from Gurowski to
      O'Connor in Charles E. Feinberg Collection), reported to Whitman, on August 13,
      1864, that "he is a madman with lucid intervals"—he had attempted "to discipline
      the firemen with a pistol" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, 3:340). Whitman maintained
      to Horace Traubel, in 1888, that "he was truly a remarkable, almost phenomenal,
      man," and that "he was, no doubt, very crazy, but also very sane" (<em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> 3:79, 340). Mrs. O'Connor
      related in a letter on , that the
      Count had said to her recently: "My Gott, I did not know that [Walt Whitman] was
      such a poet, tell him so, I have been trying every where to find him to tell him
      myself" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). In the last volume of the <em>Diary</em>, Gurowski placed Whitman's name in the first
      category of his threefold evaluation of persons "mentioned in this volume":
      "Praise," "Half and Half," and "Blame." The Count referred in his entry for
      April 18, 1864, to Whitman as among "the most original and genuine American
      hearts and minds" (187). In a footnote (372–373), appended September 12,
      1865, Gurowski abused Harlan, who had "shown himself to be animated by a spirit
      of narrow-minded persecution which would honor the most fierce Spanish or Roman
      inquisitor." Gurowski was praised by Robert Penn Warren in Malcolm Cowley, ed.,
      <em>Writers at Work: The "Paris Review" Interviews</em> (New
      York: Viking Press, 1958), 189. See also LeRoy Fischer, <em>Mississippi Valley Historical Review</em>, 36 (1949–1950),
      415–434, and <em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>,

   <p id="nyp.00206_n4">4. Thaddeus Stevens
      (1792–1868), fiery Congressman from Pennsylvania, violently opposed
      Johnson's moderate policy toward the South. He introduced the impeachment
      resolution in February, 1868.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00206_n5">5. Probably Julius W. Mason,
      a lieutenant colonel in the Fifth Cavalry. On , Jeff mentioned a J. W. Mason, who "used to be in my party on
      the Water Works." When George considered staying in the army after the war, Jeff
      conferred with Mason; see his letter of . Mason remained in the army until his death in 1882. According to
      his letter to Jeff on , Whitman
      wrote to "Captain" Mason the same day; on , Jeff noted that Mason had complied with Whitman's request. Whitman
      apparently wrote again on February 13, and Mason replied from City Point on  that a box had been sent to George on
      February 10, and that Whitman's letter would be forwarded by "1st Flag of
      Truce."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00206_n6">6. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
      and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter of
      , and later various sums which
      Whitman acknowledged in letters from , , , and . In his letter of , Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in the
      Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman wrote,
      obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of money,
      contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly
      through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted Whitman
      in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from , and ). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal welfare that on , he sent through Jeff $5 "for your
      own especial benefit."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00206_n7">7. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his
      practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems"
      (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:90, n. 85; 330).<a href="#r7">[back]
