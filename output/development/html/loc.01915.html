      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have postponed to answer your letter of 27 January in the wanton hope to collect
      among your Danish friends an amount great enough to read you an order for a number
      of copies of your writings, that should be large  sufficiently large to make impression on the newspapers in your own country.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My hope has been [
      <span class="unclear">frustrated?</span>]
      ; I am myself a very lonely man without great connections, especially in the last
      [
      <span class="unclear">years?</span>]
      . Therefore my dear friend I can only beg you accept my sincere sympathy with your
      unfortunate condition. I have myself my considerable lot of difficulties. In these
      days I have got a little harbour for my old father and now I am going to marry
      
      without fortune and closing all my expectations to the incertain fate of a book, which shall appear in the autumn. When this letter is in your hand,
      I [
      <span class="unclear">most?</span>]
       probably shall be a married man.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall as every time be glad to hear from you.</p>
