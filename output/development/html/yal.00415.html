   <p>Mother<sup><a href="#n0705" id="r1">1</a></sup> dear, I suppose you got the letter Tuesday—I am about the same—I have not gone over
      to the office to-day, &amp; am writing this in my room—mother, I send only $15 in this—will
      send the other 5 in my next—Write and send me word, soon as convenient after you get
      this—I have not been feeling so well this forenoon, but feel better now—As I said
      before I have ups and downs—but steadily advance, quite certain, though very slowly—I
      seem to have a bad cold in my head—I am going to try to go out in the car, 
      as the day is so pleasant and bright—
   </p>

      Love to you &amp; all, mother dear—
      <br></br>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
