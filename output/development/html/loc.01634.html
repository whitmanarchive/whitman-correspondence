   <p>I am about the same—consider myself improving, if any thing, though slowly enough—Pete
      I will get you the Dictionary, I will see about it soon. You spoke about the post
      
      of baggage master on the through New York train—&amp; the appointment being in Philadelphia.
      
      Who appoints them? Tell me more fully about it in your next. I got your last letter,
      &amp; several papers. 
      To-day I have rec'd a letter from Charles Eldridge—We have had a long rainy &amp; dark
      time here, 
      but mild—no snow on the ground now—I go out—as I write, the trains are going by 
      about 400 feet off, ringing &amp; smoking—there are 20 a day in full view from here.

   <p>I send you a picture for your New Years.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01634_n1">1. We follow Edwin Haviland
      Miller's example in adopting the dates assigned by Whitman's executors to the
      correspondence addressed to Doyle in January (<em>The
         Correspondence</em>, 2:265). Miller notes that all except one of the letters
      were written on Fridays, and most of them referred to Doyle's search for another
      position on the railroad.<a href="#r1">[back]
