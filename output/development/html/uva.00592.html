   </p>
   
   <p>Y'r note &amp; German paper rec'd—Thanks—I wrote you (same address as
      this) some ten weeks ago, that Rolleston,<sup><a href="#n1027" id="r2">2</a></sup> Ireland, had rec'd
      first proofs of the translation of L of G. from Switzerland, &amp; wished you to see
      them—I wrote to you to write &amp; confer with him (R)<sup><a href="#uva.00592_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—but have no word f'm you—Did you receive my
      letter? or have you heard from R or from the proofs, or printer?—I fancy the
      trans: must be out, printed, by this time—I have nothing from R. now for a
      long, long while (with that exception)—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am laid up in my sick room—essentially the sixth recurrence of my war
      paralysis—&amp; have been (two or three spells serious) for over seven
      months—but am now some easier &amp; freer. I am sitting up days most of the 
      time—diet on mutton-broth &amp; milk &amp; toast bread—am very feeble,
      cannot get across the room without assistance—have a nurse,<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r4">4</a></sup> a good, strong Canadian young man—my mentality ab't the same as

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n1027">2. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more

   <p id="n4319">4. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n3999">5. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n4168">6. Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888)included a profile photo of the poet
      on the title page. The nearly 900-page book was published in December 1888. For
      more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n0259">7. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
