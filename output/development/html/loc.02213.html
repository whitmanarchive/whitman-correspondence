      Mr. Edmund Gosse<sup><a href="#n0273" id="r1">1</a></sup> in his paper in the October Forum, entitled
      "Has America Produced a Poet?"—the question, namely, whether any American
      poet, not now living, deserves a place among the thirteen "English inheritors of
      unassailed renown" (Chaucer, Spenser, 
      Shakspeare
      
      , Milton, Dryden, Pope, Gray, Burns, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley
      and Keats).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0273">1. Sir Edmund William Gosse (1849–1928), English
      poet and author of <em>Father and Son</em> (a memoir published in
      1907), had written to Whitman on : "I can but thank you for all that I have learned from you, all the
      beauty you have taught me to see in the common life of healthy men and women,
      and all the pleasure there is in the mere humanity of other people" (see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.65.html">Friday, June 1, 1888</a>). Gosse reviewed <em>Two
         Rivulets</em> in "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/rivulets/anc.00075.html">Walt Whitman's New Book</a>," <em>The Academy</em>, 9 (24
      June 1876), 602–603, and visited Whitman in 1885 (see Whitman's letter
      inviting Gosse to visit on  and
      <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–1977], 3:384 n80). In a letter to
      Richard Maurice Bucke on , Whitman
      characterized Gosse as "one of the amiable conventional wall-flowers of
      literature" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). For more about Gosse, see Jerry F.
      King, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_112.html">Gosse, Sir Edmund (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02213_n1">2. Whitman's response was
      published in the November 24, 1888, <em>Critic</em>, along with
      responses by many other writers (including John Greenleaf Whittier, John
      Burroughs, Francis Parkman, and Julia Ward Howe). Whitman wrote that "the names
      of Bryant, Emerson, Whittier and Longfellow (with even added names, sometimes
      Southerners, sometimes Western or other writers of only one or two pieces,)
      deserve in my opinion an equally high niche of renown as belongs to any on the
      baker's dozen of that glorious list."<a href="#r2">[back]
