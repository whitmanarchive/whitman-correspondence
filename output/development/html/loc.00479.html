   </p>
   
   <p>I enclose a check for ten dollars payable to your order—the money comes from
      Chaphe<sup><a href="#loc.00479_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> who wants you to send him copies of your various books so far as it will pay 
      for them—particularly he desires to get Dr Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> book—You will remember that you sent him a copy of the "Author's Edition" of Leaves
      of Grass—so I suppose that may be left out—If you express the books (which I suppose
      would be the best way) direct them to me and we will pay the express charges at this
      end.
   </p>
   
   <p>There is no particular hurry for this; you of course will leave it till you are feeling
      all right<sup><a href="#loc.00479_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—and the hot weather has lifted a little. In depositing this check or getting the
      money for it you will just write your name on the back below mine
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all well have had a terrible seige of hot weather—yesterday—they say the heat was greater on the street level than it
      has been since 1838—it was 102 in the shade at my office
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We were all very glad to hear from you—the telegram came all right—as did the postal<sup><a href="#loc.00479_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I hope you are having cool weather now—and that you will have no more of the bad
      spells—We had a fine shower last night—and to-day it has dropped some 18 degrees—so
      that we are comparatively comfortable—I dont want another day like yesterday
   </p>
   
   <p>All send love—and sincerely hope you are all right. I am trying to arrange to get
      on and pay you a visit some time this fall—if I can make it, I want to do it—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
