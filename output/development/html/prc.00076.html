   <p id="prc.00076_n1">1. Charles A. Dana
      (1819–1897) was the editor of the <em>New York Sun</em> (see
      the letter from Whitman to Robert Carter of ). In <em>The Household Book of Poetry</em> (1882)
      Dana included six poems from <em>Leaves of Grass</em>: "Vigil
      Strange I Kept on the Field One Night," "A Sight in Camp in the Daybreak Gray
      and Dim," "Great Are the Myths," "The Mystic Trumpeter," and excerpts from "When
      Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" and "Song of Myself" (section 35).<a href="#r1">[back]
