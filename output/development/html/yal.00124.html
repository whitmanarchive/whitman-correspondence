   <p>It is with great pleasure that I sit down with pen in hand to 
      address
      
       a few lines to you hoping to find you enjoying good health which same I am
      enjoying myself.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I felt very sorry that I did not see you previous to your departure for Washington
      We
      have had a very pleasant New Year in the city and the weather has continued 
       very favorable since
      with the exception of one snow storm, but as luck would have it I was not exposed
      to
      it, for I have been discharged from the Road since New Years <u>Eve</u> and have not done anything since, in fact I have not had a chance to
      look for anything since because I have been suffering with a very sore foot which
      has confined me to the house, but I am now able to walk around and hope shall be
      able to find something to do very shortly as I do not feel contented without
      working; but still and withal I hope that will not be the cause of separating  our friendship for no
      matter where I am employed or what it may be at I shall still continue to correspond
      and can never forget your kind friendship towards me

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Flood was a streetcar conductor in New York,
      known, according to an unidentified notation on his letter to Walt Whitman, as
      "Broadway Jack." According to date entries in an address book (the Library of
      Congress # 109), Whitman saw Flood on September 30, 1868, and October 5, 1868,
      and rode with him on his Second Avenue car. Flood had been a conductor for ten
      years. After Whitman's return to Washington, there was a brief correspondence,
      consisting of four extant letters from Whitman (dated , ,
      , and ) and one from the young man. Flood wrote on : "Sir, It is with great pleasure
      that I sit down with pen in hand to address a few lines to you." He informed
      Walt Whitman that he had lost his position on New Year's Eve and that he was now
      seeking another job: "I shall still continue to correspond and can never forget
      your kind friendship towards me. ... Your True and Ever intimate friend."
      According to the first listing of his name in the New York Directory, in
      1872â€“1873, he was at that time either in the milk business or a
      milkman.
