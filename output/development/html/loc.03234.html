      <br></br><br></br>My dear Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I see by the papers that you may be going to England. If you go you must see Wm Bell Scott,<sup><a href="#n0547" id="r2">2</a></sup> the painter and poet,
      the first (unless, Dante Rossetti<sup><a href="#n0521" id="r3">3</a></sup> were earlier) of your English
      admirers. He will be glad to welcome you. And I glad to give you a note of
      introduction when I know you are going. We are old friends and regular
      correspondents, and I had much delightful time with him in England and Scotland
      during 1883 and '84, being then across the water. 
   </p>
   
   <p> You will tell me too if I can be of other use to you. I may  be visiting the dear old
      land again next year, probably having to look after the bringing out of a book—on
      Wood Engraving.
   </p>
   
   <p> As I am writing I think of something to send you, which ought to have come to you
      before. It is a bit of home-production, setting up, printing, binding and all.
      You'll not value it less for that. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Need I say that I am glad to see a good report of your health and that, however
      drifted off—as seems too generally our human fate—I am always pleased to think of
      you. Let me hear from you and believe me always 
   </p>

      heartily yours

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William J. Linton
      (1812–1897), a British-born wood engraver, came to the United States in
      1866 and settled near New Haven, Connecticut. He illustrated the works of John
      Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, and
      others, wrote the "indispensable" <em>History of Wood-Engraving in
         America</em> (1882), and edited <em>Poetry of America,
         1776–1876</em> (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Whitman's
      poems as well as a frontispiece engraving of the poet. According to his <em>Threescore and Ten Years, 1820 to
         1890—Recollections</em> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Whitman
      in Washington and later visited him in Camden (which Whitman reported in his
      , letter to Peter Doyle): "I
      liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, . . . a true poet
      who could not write poetry, much of 
      wilfulness
      
       accounting for his neglect of form."
