   A valued Irish friend, a frequent traveler and resident
   on the European Continent—here is an extract from one of his late letters to
   me:<sup><a href="#loc.05120_n20" id="r1">1</a></sup> 
   
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="opener">

   <p> There has been much
      more interest here,<sup><a href="#n1027" id="r2">2</a></sup> more sympathy and more indignation felt
      about the Presidents attempted murder,<sup><a href="#loc.05120_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> than if he was a European sovereign. From
      all sides, I think, the world looks to America; we love our own lands as much as
      you, but we feel that the future of the race is being decided there. Political
      corruption and public dishonesty are instinctively felt to be far more significant,
      occurring in America than in Germany or England, and we have been hearing so much
      about them lately that everyone's mind has been bent in expectation towards
      each new President, each striking turn of events in the U.S.; thinking that the time
      has come at last when something will be done to justify our hopes. We have thought
      we saw it being done since—Garfield's election—Hercules letting in the
      cleansing flood. Now, rightly or wrongly, this impression has been immensely
      strengthened. When we heard the President was dead it was as if we heard of a
      martyrdom. Now that the reports are more and more favourable everyday, it seems to
      us as if the good cause had assuredly triumphed in the first wrestle. I don't know
      how far these impressions of the state of things are true; but they have
      verisimilitude. I liked so much all I could hear of President Garfield. Is it not
      wonderful and inscrutable that out of the confusion and slander and insidious
      intrigue that seems to attend every Presidential election a man like that should
      have emerged? Things look to me every way
      as if the people were awaking.

   <p>I see your friend R. M. Bucke has brought out a
      book on 'Man's Moral Nature'—I must get it. I saw it noticed &amp; praised
      in the 'Spectator' a few days ago—the critic said that "Mr. Bucke appeared
      to be an ardent admirer of Walt Whitman—hence, perhaps, some of the
      obscurities in the volume—which, we candidly confess, are beyond us."<sup><a href="#loc.05120_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> The Spectator is an excellent (weekly)
      paper—thoughtful, honest, manly; Radical in politics, but in religion
      belonging to 
      that rather vapid sect, the Neo-Christian or Broad Church. Barring this latter
      particular there is a very great deal in the 'Spectator' which might be written
      out of you; and I have no doubt that if you had thrown your works into the form
      of systematic treatises and written in a strictly refined cultured and
      gentlemanlike way, you might have gained the approbation of the Spectator,
      possibly even of the Saturday Review, to which latter journal you are still a
      thorn in the flesh, of the first magnitude.<sup><a href="#loc.05120_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup></p> 
   
   
   <p>We have left Bad-Elster, the baths having perfectly

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05120_n20">1. Whitman evidently sent this
      letter to someone else, and wrote to send along with it this note, which appears
      on a separate leaf. Much of the letter itself Whitman crossed out with pencil,
      creating an "extract," including the header and the last several paragraphs. He
      also wrote "Dresden, Saxony" and added a ¶" at the top. The letter cuts off
      at the end, indicating that there was probably another page, which has not been
      located.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1027">2. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05120_n1">3. The newly elected
      President Garfield—to whom Rolleston had referred enthusiastically in his
      letter to Whitman of —had
      been shot by a disappointed office-seeker on July 2, 1881; he died on September
      19, 1881.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05120_n2">4. Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke
      (1837–1902), a Canadian psychiatrist, became an intimate friend of Whitman
      and wrote the first complete life of the poet (see the letter from Rolleston to
      Whitman of ). The review to
      which Rolleston refers appeared in the June 4, 1881 issue of the <em>Spectator</em> (54, 742). The reviewer presents as the main
      thesis of Bucke's <em>Man's Moral Nature</em> (New York, 1879) the
      concept that love and faith are the basic elements of all progress and that
      Christianity is but "one step in an immense, perhaps an infinite series." The
      exact reading of the quotation given by Rolleston is: "The author of this essay
      is, it appears, an ardent admirer of Walt Whitman; hence, perhaps, some of the
      obscurities in his pages, which we must candidly say baffle us."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05120_n3">5. The attitude of the <em>Saturday Review</em> toward Whitman was unsympathetic during
      his whole writing career. When Whitman sent a copy of his newly published <em>Leaves of Grass</em> to the periodical with a suggestion that
      it be favorably reviewed, he evoked the editor's comment that "If the <em>Leaves of Grass</em> should come into anybody's possession,
      our advice is to throw them instantly behind the fire." Representative of the
      <em>Review's</em> attitude is an article in the March 18, 1876
      issue written in answer to a current drive by Whitman's friends to relieve his
      financial distress. It begins, "Whitman, it may be explained, is an American
      writer who some years back attracted attention by a volume of so-called poems
      which were chiefly remarkable for their absurd extravagance and shameless
      obscenity, and who has since, we are glad to say, been little heard of among
      decent people," and continues with such descriptions of his writing as a "stock
      of garbage," "so-called poetry," and "Whitman wares." The article even calls
      Whitman a "dirty bird which is shunned on account of its unclean habits."<a href="#r5">[back]
