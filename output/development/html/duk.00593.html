   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00593_n9">1. This letter dates to March
      23, 1870. The date "march 23" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, but
      Richard Maurice Bucke marked the letter with a speculative month of May and the
      year 1870. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with the month in Louisa's hand and
      dated the letter March 23?, 1870 (see Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961], 2:367).
      Bucke's date is incorrect, and his error originated in a misreading of Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman's March 18, 1870 letter to Louisa (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth
      M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas
         Jefferson Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984],
      143). Jeff's month is hurried and trails off after the letters "Ma," so Bucke
      misread Jeff's date as "Ma[y?]." Berthold and Price date Jeff's letter March and
      transcribe his month "Mar" (143). This letter from Louisa is written on the
      reverse of her son Jeff's letter. The month March is correct and is consistent
      both with Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's return to St. Louis and with a
      recent storm in Brooklyn. Mattie departed Brooklyn on March 14, 1870, and she
      arrived in St. Louis on March 16 (see Louisa's  letter to Walt and Jeff's  letter to Louisa).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00593_n6">2. Walt Whitman's March 21?,
      1870 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:362).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00593_n4">3. The "within letter" from the
      preceding Monday is unlikely to be from Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman: if
      such a letter existed, it is not extant. A March 14 letter from Mattie is
      impossible as an enclosure because she departed Brooklyn for St. Louis on that
      date (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). The more probable case is that the
      phrase "within letter" refers to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's brief letter
      on Mattie's arrival in St. Louis. Louisa's letter is written on the reverse of
      Jeff's letter (see Jeff's  letter to
      Louisa). If Jeff's letter was mailed on March 18, it probably arrived in
      Brooklyn on March 21, 1873 (Monday).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00593_n7">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. Mattie had visited Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in Brooklyn for
      treatment of her throat ailment from February 16 to March 14, 1870. For more on
      Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of
         Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      1–26.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00593_n8">5. A damaging storm hit
      Brooklyn on March 16, 1870 (see "Long Island Items: Effects of the Storm To-Day
      on Long Island," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, March 17, 1870,
      14).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00593_n5">6. After Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman's departure for St. Louis in May 1867, Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman stayed with the family of Gordon F. Mason, a prominent businessman, in
      Towanda, Pennsylvania, from June to September 1867. Mattie was a close friend to
      Mason's daughter Irene Mason, and Jeff was a close friend to his son Julius
      "Jules" Mason—Jeff and Jules worked together at the Brooklyn Water Works.
      See Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha
         Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977), 37, 42;
      see also Jeff Whitman's  letter
      to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">7. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00430_n5">8. The Brown family began
      boarding in the same house as the Whitmans on Portland Avenue, Brooklyn in April
      1860. The relationship between the Browns and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's
      family was often strained, but the Browns remained in the Portland Avenue house
      for five years. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman maintained a cordial relationship with
      the Browns after Jeff and his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman departed for
      St. Louis. Years later Louisa called on Mrs. Brown and remarked to Walt Whitman,
      "if Jeff and matt knew i had been to see mrs Brown they would cross me off their
      books" (see her  letter).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00593_n13">9. The man named Willie is
      probably the son of tailor John Brown, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's former
      neighbor. After a visit from John Brown in February 1868, Louisa wrote that
      Brown's son Willie was married (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman). Willie Brown's wife has not been
      identified.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00593_n14">10. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      presumably reads a serial fiction in weekly installments. The words "week" and
      "weekly" are common in newspaper and magazine titles, and she may refer not to
      the title of a periodical but to the next weekly issue.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00593_n11">11. The postscript begins
      inverted at the top of the second page and continues in the left margin.<a href="#r11">[back]
