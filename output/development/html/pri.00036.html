      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of 12th recd. I sent Dowden's letter soon after getting it, to O'Connor, with
      written request on it to send to Dr Bucke, with similar request to him to send to
      you—I supposed you had it a fortnight or more ago.<sup><a href="#pri.00036_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> I yesterday wrote to
      O'Connor about it asking him to forward to you directly. The same round (to
      O'C—to Dr. B and to <em>you</em>) to a long notice of
      "Specimen Days" in the "Academy" by Dowden<sup><a href="#pri.00036_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I supposed you had rec'd
      both—I fancy you certainly will get them—perhaps you have
      already—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have those Emerson vols (just as you lent them to me over 10 years ago) boxed up
      &amp; stored with other traps in Washington at the house
      of old Mr Nash, Peter Doyle's uncle—Shall surely have the boxes here before
      long, (or go on &amp; overhaul them) &amp; if that will do—will certainly see the
      vols are sent to you—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am quite over my bad spell of a month ago—havn't made any move from Camden yet,
      but shall—"Specimen Days" moves pretty
      sluggishly—no great demand—L of G. better, but by no means what was
      anticipated—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am more than satisfied, however—every thing might have been so much
      worse—&amp; best of all, in my mind, on looking over L of G. as it now
      stands—I don't worry about how much better it ought to be, but thankful it is
      as well as it is—I am content to let it rest, to let it go as it is, without the least
      wish to meddle with it any more, (a
      feeling I havn't had before, but now certainly
      settled.)
   </p>
   
   <p>I have a criticism on Burns in to-morrows 'Critic'<sup><a href="#pri.00036_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Love to 'Sula and the dear
      little fellow—(I bear you all more in mind than you think for)—I hear
      there is a notice of L of G. in Dec. "Nineteenth Century"<sup><a href="#pri.00036_n6" id="r4">4</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pri.00036_n3">1. About November 10,
      Whitman received a letter from Edward Dowden which he characterized as "like a
      kindly living talk and hand clasp" (see Whitman's letter to Dowden of ), and then forwarded it to
      William D. O'Connor, who was to send it to Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke and John
      Burroughs. The letter is apparently lost.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00036_n4">2. Dowden's review of <em>Specimen Days</em> appeared in <em>The
         Academy</em> on November 18, 1882, as he informed Whitman on  (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915],
      2:363).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00036_n5">3. Whitman sent "Robert
      Burns" to Jeannette L. Gilder of <em>The Critic</em> on , and it appeared on December 15.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00036_n6">4. <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1881/anc.01079.html">G. C. Macaulay's review</a> of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      appeared in <em>The Nineteenth Century</em>, 12 (December 1882),
      903–18.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00036_n7">5. On , after Whitman decided to purchase
      the plates of the Osgood edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, he
      asked Burroughs for a loan of $100, which he repaid on January 17, 1883 (<em>Daybooks and Notebooks</em>, ed. William White [New York: New
      York University Press, 1977], 2:310).<a href="#r5">[back]
