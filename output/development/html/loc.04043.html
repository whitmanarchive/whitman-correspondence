   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04043_n1">1. "Summer Days in Canada"
      appeared in the London (Ontario) <em>Advertiser</em> on the date
      stipulated. The article did not appear in the New York <em>Tribune</em>. It later was included in <em>Specimen
         Days</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall (New York: New York University Press, 1963),
      236–241, 345–346. According to Whitman's Commonplace Book, the
      article was sent to the following papers, in addition to the two mentioned:
      Boston <em>Herald</em>, Philadelphia <em>Press</em>,
      Cincinnati <em>Commercial</em>, Chicago <em>Tribune</em>, Detroit <em>Free Press</em>, Louisville <em>Courier-Journal</em>, Washington <em>Post</em>,
      and to Canadian newspapers in New Brunswick, Halifax, Toronto, and Montreal
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). The price, except for the <em>Tribune</em>, was $10. Whitman offered the piece to the
      Woodstown (N.J.) <em>Register</em> for $7, however, and to the
      Camden <em>Daily Post</em> without charge. Only the Camden <em>Daily Post</em> and the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> printed the piece (Edwin Haviland Miller, <em>Walt
         Whitman: The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 181).<a href="#r1">[back]
