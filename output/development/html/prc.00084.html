      <br></br><br></br>Dear Harry
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Thanks for your good letter—I have had my hands full the last six or eight
      weeks getting my new book in shape, seeing to every thing, and watching the proofs
      day &amp; night<sup><a href="#prc.00084_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—(I have had to read the proofs at
      night all through)—But now it is over &amp; I begin to feel free
      again—(And yet I must say I kind of enjoy it, &amp; should like to go through
      the same job two or three times a year)—I have had the mighty good luck to
      keep well this summer all through—my usual bad spell (I always expect one
      after I have felt pretty good awhile) has not come on—
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear boy I am glad you too keep so well &amp; are having good quiet times—I
      envy you being down there in the country—(I always thought Clementon<sup><a href="#prc.00084_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> a much pleasanter spot than you[r] folks 
      appear'd
      
       to think it)—I could be satisfied to live
      there—
   </p>
   
   <p>—I got a long letter from Herbert<sup><a href="#prc.00084_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—he is
      getting along well—traveling and painting—I have also 
      rec'd
      
       a letter
      from Edward Carpenter<sup><a href="#prc.00084_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—he is well—he sends
      his love to you—
   </p>
   
   <p>—Hank perhaps while I am writing this (Sunday noon) you are over home—I
      wish I was there with you all—
   </p>
   
   <p>—As I finish my letter a lady opposite is singing &amp; playing the hymn
      "Nearer my god to Thee"—how beautiful it sounds—
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Love to you my darling young brother
      <br></br>W.W.—
