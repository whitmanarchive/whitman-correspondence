   <p>Since reaching home Wednesday evening I have had my hands pretty
      full
      and have still enough to keep me out of mischeif. The accounts from
      Pardee<sup><a href="#n4274" id="r2">2</a></sup> in Sarnia
      are not very good and I shall go there tomorrow evening to have a look at him. I
      have heard nothing yet from Harned<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> or Trauble<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup> since
      I left Camden but there has hardly been time—hope to get a card this
      evening—I have found time to write the circular<sup><a href="#loc.07212_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> and give it to the  printer, I will
      send you a <u>proof</u> early in the week—but mind <u>you are not supposed to see it</u> however you may as well
      and perhaps you would suggest a verbal change or two—if you feel like it
      do so.
   </p>
   
   <p>If we get plenty of money (as I confidently hope) as a result of this circular it
      may be that you would not care to issue the $5. book, as we spoke of, but that is
      a matter to consider later. Our grounds here are perfectly lovely. I wish I
      could drive you about them—the weather is charming here—I have in
      front of me, on my desk, here in my office an enormous bouquet of snowballs,
      peonies, sweet flag &amp;c

   <p>I have gone through "A Backward Glance"<sup><a href="#wel.00001_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> and think it by far the most valuable of
      all the <u>explanatory</u> pieces you have written. My
      opinion (not that it is worth any thing) is that <u>this</u>
      book of yours ought to have a sale and I think it should be published at a quite
      reasonable price—say $1. or $1.25 to encourage this—if it <u>should</u> sell it would no doubt introduce many new
      people to L.of G.

   <p>Mail in—no word from Camden. I hope you are not worse</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4274">2. Timothy Blair Pardee
      (1830–1889) was a Canadian lawyer and politician, member of the
      Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontaria, Canada, and Minister of the
      Crown. Pardee appointed Richard Maurice Bucke, with whom he was a close friend,
      as the Superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane in Hamilton at its founding
      in 1876, and then the next year as Superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane
      in London. For more on Pardee, see H. V. Nelles, "Pardee, Timothy Blair," <em>Dictionary of Canadian Biography</em> Vol. 11 (Toronto:
      University of Toronto Press, 1982).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.03745_n1">3. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel, was Horace Traubel's
      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07212_n2">5. Bucke was writing a circular
      soliciting funds to pay for a live-in nurse for Whitman; Whitman strongly
      disapproved of this effort. See Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.82.html">Monday, June 18, 1888</a>.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="wel.00001_n2">6. Whitman on December 21,
      1883, sent "A Backward Glance on My Own Road" to <em>The North
         American Review</em> and asked $40; it was returned. He then sent the piece
      to <em>The Critic</em> on December 27 and requested $12, and it
      was printed on January 5, 1884 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). When the magazine failed to send, as requested, copies of the
      article to Dowden, Symonds, Schmidt, Rolleston, and O'Connor, Whitman sent them
      himself on January 9 or thereabouts (Commonplace Book). The article was later
      incorporated into "A Backward Glance o'er Travel'd Roads" (<em>November Boughs</em> [1888], 5–18).<a href="#r6">[back]
