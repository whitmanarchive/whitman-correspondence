   <p>Your letter of 13th is just to hand.<sup><a href="#loc.07256_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I have looked over "N.B."<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r3">3</a></sup> a good deal since I wrote you last and like the little
      volume better all the time. The "Backward Glance" I consider very valuable, the
      "Sands" still more so—I should be sorry to lose any of it. That is the main
      point about the "Complete Works"<sup><a href="#n6137" id="r4">4</a></sup> to have an <u>authoratative</u>
      text which can be relied on every time as what the Author <u>intended</u> to say. I finished my Annual Report Sunday and mailed it
      yesterday—am at work now on "Lectures on Psycology &amp; mental diseases" for
      the  medical students
      here. Wm Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r5">5</a></sup> left for N.Y. yesterday—if all is well I
      expect him to want me down in two to three weeks—so far all looks well for the
      meter I am only anxious about getting it patented all over i.e. in Europe as well
      as
      America. We are having such stormy weather—it was a little better this morning
      until the last few minutes now it has set in to blow and rain at a great
      rate—I am uneasy about O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r6">6</a></sup> too, I fear he is quite
      sick, should you get word from him or of him be sure to let me know—I trust it
      will not be more than 2 to 3 weeks before I shall see you again.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4284">5. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
