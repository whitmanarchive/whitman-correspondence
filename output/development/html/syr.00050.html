   <p>Willy Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r2">2</a></sup> has gone East. Left here this morning on 11.30 train,
      goes direct to N.Y., will spend a couple of days there buying certain material
      wanted for meter, then proceed to Danbury<sup><a href="#syr.00050_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> to construct
      gas meter. About end of May he ought to be through and if all goes well I may be
      East again in June or July. [—] I send you today a copy of my Annual report,
      after you have looked it over let Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup> have it—I have
      only a very few copies so cannot send one to Each as I intended—tell H. to
      show it to anyone he knows of who wants to see it. It is warmer today, snow nearly
      gone, spring may set in in earnest soon now tho' it is still very early with us for
      any growth. I am well, getting a good rest since my return home, sleep about 10
      hours a night right along. Am still very much occupied all day so that I have time
      to read only a very little—Am just finishing "Wieland"<sup><a href="#n7023" id="r5">5</a></sup> [by] Chas. Brockden
      Brown<sup><a href="#n6184" id="r6">6</a></sup> [/] first of his I ever read (got a set of his books from M<u>c</u>Kay<sup><a href="#n4983" id="r7">7</a></sup> more than a year ago but never
      looked at them till now)—it is one of the most ghastly books conceivable, old
      (Castle of ontranto)<sup><a href="#n7022" id="r8">8</a></sup> style. No doubt you have read some of Brown's books if not all
      of them.<sup><a href="#syr.00050_n3" id="r9">9</a></sup> [—] A gloomy but pleasant afternoon here
      as I sit at my desk in my office and look out the window, roads very sloppy with the
      melting snow. I hope you are prospering but I fear you are not to any marked
      extent

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4284">2. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

   <p id="n4983">7. David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
