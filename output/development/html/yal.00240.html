   </p>  
   
   <p>I was real glad to get word—&amp; good word—from you this morning by your
      postal card of 25th—the early summer has always been <em>your time</em> &amp; it seems to keep so just the same—Dr
      Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> writes often &amp; is the same good staunch
      friend—he is still at his Asylum, Canada, &amp; full of work—some
      lecturing—Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r3">3</a></sup> is well, living at Belmont still,
      &amp; at work in Cambridge—his book ab't me not yet printed, but I believe it is
      settled to come out by the Glasgow publisher Wilson—
   </p>
   
   <p>I rec'd a good &amp; quite copious letter from O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r4">4</a></sup> ab't a
      week ago—he is still very ill, appears to be little or no real
      improvement—nothing critical however—has paralysis—writes with the
      old fire &amp; fervor
   </p>
   
   <p>—With me things move on much the same—a little feebler every successive season
      &amp; deeper inertia—brain power apparently very little affected, &amp;
      emotional power not at all—I yet write a little for the <em>Herald</em><sup><a href="#n4160" id="r5">5</a></sup>—&amp;c.—Mrs Louise Chandler Moulton<sup><a href="#n4264" id="r6">6</a></sup> was here a day or two ago—pleasant visit—I have lately rec'd a letter
      from Prof: Hamlin Garland<sup><a href="#yal.00240_n2" id="r7">7</a></sup> who is lecturing in Boston,
      wh' I enclose, with slips—Send to Dr Bucke, after reading—As I write, I
      am sitting down stairs in my big arm chair—My sister Lou (George's wife)<sup><a href="#n0368" id="r8">8</a></sup> has just been here—It looks like such a fine &amp; bright
      weather I shall try to get out in my rig.

   <p>As I finish I get a letter from Dr B.<sup><a href="#yal.00240_n3" id="r9">9</a></sup> &amp; returning two I sent him to
      read—I will enclose them also in this—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="yal.00240_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      John Burroughs | West Park | Ulster county | New York. It is postmarked: Cam[illegible] | A[illegible] | 48[illegible] | 88. The envelope includes Whitman's address, printed as
      follows: WALT. WHITMAN, Camden, | NEW JERSEY.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">3. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">4. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4160">5. Whitman contributed a series of
      poems and prose pieces to the <em>New York Herald</em> at the
      invitation of the editor, James Gordon Bennett, Jr. From December 1887 through
      August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems were published in the paper.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4264">6. Louise Chandler Moulton
      (1835–1908) was an American poet and critic who published several
      collections of verse and prose, as well as regular contributions to the <em>New York Tribune</em> and <em>Boston
         Herald.</em>
      <a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00240_n2">7. Hamlin Garland
      (1860–1940) was an American novelist and autobiographer, known especially
      for his works about the hardships of farm life in the American West. For his
      relationship to Whitman, see Thomas K. Dean, "Garland, Hamlin," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998). On , Garland, who was a friend of
      Kennedy's, wrote to the poet for the first time. He was giving a series of
      lectures entitled "Literature of Democracy" in which he was "trying to analyze
      certain tendencies of American life somewhat in accordance with the principles
      you have taught." Garland did not share Kennedy's gloom about Whitman's
      reception: "I am often astonished at finding so many friends and sympathizers in
      your work and Cause. In my teaching and lecturing I find no difficulty in
      getting Converts to the new doctrine and find your poems mainly irresistible in
      effect. True they do not always agree that they <em>are</em>
      'poems' though acknowledge their power and beauty. I do not care what they call
      them (I say to them) and receive their allegiance just the same."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0368">8. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
