   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00504_n4">1. This letter dates to October
      17, 1867. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "October 17," and Richard
      Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1867. In his calendar of letters, Edwin Haviland
      Miller included no letter dated October 17, 1867, but he did reference a letter
      from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman that he dated to October 7, 1867
      (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 1:378). No other letter from Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman could date to October 7, 1867, so Miller's date must be an error. Louisa
      stated that she was writing on a Thursday, the day of the week on which October
      17 fell in 1867. Additional confirmation for the letter's date is that Louisa's
       letter to Walt—which is
      concerned also with $10 that has gone missing in the mail—refers to this
      letter as the one she wrote "thursday last."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00465_n9">2. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00502_n3">3. The nickname "Sis" refers to
      Jessie Louisa Whitman (1863–1957), the daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Jessie and her sister Manahatta "Hattie" were both favorites of
      their uncle Walt. The nickname "Sis" was given first to Manahatta but was passed
      to her younger sister Jessie Louisa when Manahatta became "Hattie."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">4. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
