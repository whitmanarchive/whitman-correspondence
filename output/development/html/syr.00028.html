      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>It has been a great trouble to me not to be able to write to you. The difficulty of
      managing pen and ink is indescribable, and only equalled by the difficulty of
      putting even the simplest expressions together. I begin to fear that paralysis is
      not far off. I move about with slowness and difficulty. But worst of all is the
      horrible deadness of the mind. I put  in an appearance every day at the
      office, but it is a long time since I have been able to do anything.
   </p>
   
   <p>I got two postal cards from you in August, and recently yours of the 19th ultimo.
      It
      saddens me to know of your condition, and I wish it could be otherwise.
   </p>
   
   <p>You mention having got a German paper (in August) with a long notice of L. of G. Did
      you see a pamphlet by Dr. Karl Knortz<sup><a href="#uva.00476_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—a lecture about
      you delivered in New York to a large audience, I heard with great applause? He sent me a copy, and
      I undertook to get it translated, but the young lady I trusted hung fire when just
      near the close, and I have not got the translation quite yet! I hope to have it
      before long. A German friend who glanced over the article, told me the language was
      very powerful.
   </p>
   
   <p>You remember the article from the <u>Nation</u> in review of the
      New Zealand professor's book about you.<sup><a href="#syr.00028_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> Since then  Charley
      Eldridge<sup><a href="#loc.01007_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> has sent me the book, which I will forward
      to you, if you would like to see it. It is remarkable and good, though I don't
      always see as he does, and wish he were more comprehensive. But it is most
      significant, and he is flat-footed for you, and from a background of theory which
      compels respect, and must make the Apaches of criticism pause to think.
   </p>
   
   <p> What is most significant, however, is the article called "American Poets" in the
       October number
      of the British Quarterly Review. C.W.E. has just sent it to me, and I want to run
      it
      over once more, when I will send it to you. It is disfigured by a few lines, but as
      a whole it is a glorious tribute, and full of splendid and whole-hearted ardor. He
      reviews all our poets—Lowell, Whittier, Bryant, Longfellow, etc.,—and
      then puts you far above them all, giving you the larger part of the reviewing
      space besides. Now when you reflect that the London Quarterly is the great High Tory
      and aristocratic organ in Great Britain—the very essence of patrician
      respectability—you will realize where we are, and the advance we have made!
      The article is a bad blow for the enemy! This is evident by the silence of the <u>Tribune</u>, the <u>Nation</u>, etc., in
      regard to it.
      They are mum!
   </p> 
   
   <p>I have your article on Burns<sup><a href="#syr.00028_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> and am going to read it
      carefully, when I am a little better. The <u>scan</u> I have given
      it, made me feel that it was admirable. I look with interest for all the others.
   </p>
   
   <p>If you are writing again to Dr. Bucke,<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r5">5</a></sup> tell him how badly off I
      am, and that I will answer his letters as soon as I can. At present my brain is just
      mud—I have a heap of letters unanswered.
   </p>
   
   <p>No matter what the venal press may say, there is no doubt that Julian Hawthorne told
      the truth about his interview with Lowell, and that Lowell lied. Julian got him into
      an awful scrape, no doubt, by the publication. 'Tis joy to see a bird like Lowell
      come to grief with his foreign friends, to whom he toadied so basely.<sup><a href="#syr.00028_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I hope to write you a better letter next time, and that your locomotion and general
      health may improve. I am always deeply glad to hear from you.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00476_n1">1. Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="syr.00028_n1">2. Probably a publication by
      John Macmillan Brown of New Zealand's University of Canterbury, who visited
      Whitman in 1884. It is unclear what the title of the publication was, but it was
      apparently reviewed in London's <em>The Nation</em> in the early
      1880s.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01007_n4">3. Charles W. Eldridge was one
      of the owners of Thayer and Eldridge, a Boston publishing firm responsible for
      the third edition of Whitman's <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860).
      For more on Whitman's relationship with Thayer and Eldridge see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="syr.00028_n2">4. "Robert Burns" had already
      appeared in <em>The Critic</em> on December 16, 1882, and Whitman
      republished it in the <em>North American Review</em> under the
      title "Robert Burns as Poet and Person" in November 1886.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="syr.00028_n3">6. Julian Hawthorne
      (1846–1934) was the son of Nathaniel Hawthorne and an American critic and
      journalist. In October 24, 1886, he published an interview with his mentor James
      Russell Lowell, in which Lowell apparently called the Prince of Wales "immensely
      fat"—a quote Lowell later publicly denied.<a href="#r6">[back]
