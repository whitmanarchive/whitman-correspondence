   <p>Let me give you some flying impromptu notes<sup><a href="#ucb.00059_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> confessedly
      all too meager (a <u>hiatus</u> every where) of my journey starting three months
      since from the Atlantic Coast and so railroading through New Jersey, Penn, West
      Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin over Kansas and the Great Plains into
      the very height &amp; heart Rocky Mountains with
      the canons, parks and peaks. Them I reserve for a special letter. Returning to Denver
      for a few days, then by the
      southern road to Pueblo, over the Plains, to Kansas City, stopping there a
      while. *Then through Missouri again to 
      St
      
       Louis, where I have been spending a month.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="ucb.00059_n1">1. This is a draft letter.
      Whitman returned from his Western jaunt to St. Louis in October 1879; if he had
      indeed spent a month there, then this letter was written in the last days of
      October or sometime during November.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="ucb.00059_n3">2. This letter may have
      been intended for Robert R. Hubach, editor of the St. Louis <em>Post-Dispatch</em>. Hubach published three interviews with Whitman during
      October 1879.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="ucb.00059_n2">3. The "flying impromptu
      notes" were never published in newspapers or magazines; however, they appear in
      <em>Specimen Days</em> from sections "Swallows on the River"
      through "Upon our Land" (204â€“30).<a href="#r3">[back]
