      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>So glad to hear from you once more—and that you keep going, not withstanding
      all the buffets of time &amp; fortune. Very wearisome sometimes I fear, these long
      spells of illness: so complicated, never-ended. Just now I am giving every day to
      see an old friend, 72 
      yrs.
      
       of age—who is very badly down with heart disease—an old
      harpist—plays at country fairs, &amp;c, a reader &amp; admirer of your Leaves of G., communist, and dreamer of social ideals—he keeps saying "<u>this disease of mine has no end, no sides, and no middle</u>"
      I fear you must feel like that! Dear Walt—how strange it is that we are bound
      so &amp; entangled in this thing we call the body, without being able to get at the <u>connections</u>. I got 
      yr.
      
       November Boughs<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r1">1</a></sup> too for which many thanks. I like the book ever so much,
      both outside &amp;
      in. Have just written a review of it for the <u>Scottish Art
         Review</u>—wh. I will send you when it comes out. I like the color &amp; shape of the
      book—good strong sewing too. Title is a good one. Old Salt Kossabone is fine,
      &amp; Red Jacket, and many others. Yonnondio I like very much. The whole book is full
      of
      yourself Walt, and the great invisible wind sweeping 
      thro'
       
       the boughs—has a quality of its own too I 
      sh'
      
       say, 
      wh.
      
       is a worthy addition to 
      L
      
       of 
      G
      
       &amp;
      Specimen Days<sup><a href="#n4121" id="r2">2</a></sup>.
   </p>
   
   <p>Glad to hear Herbert G.<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r3">3</a></sup> is doing well. Enclosed draft is only a
      duplicate of one we sent you in May—wh. probably 
      you got all right—but not having heard I thought I 
      wd.
      
       send you this instead of destroying it. You can destroy it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Everything going well with me just now—I have George Hukin<sup><a href="#loc.01243_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; his wife up here
      for Christmas—friends I mentioned to you a year or more ago. He &amp; I are still
      close friends. The Rain is beating upon the windows—&amp; he is reading
      Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r5">5</a></sup> book about you.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3999">1. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n4121">2. The first issue of Whitman's <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em> was published by the
      Philadelphia firm of Rees Welsh and Company in 1882. The second issue was
      published by David McKay. Many of the autobiographical notes, sketches, and
      essays that focus on the poet's life during and beyond the Civil War had been
      previously published in periodicals or in <em>Memoranda During the
         War</em> (1875–1876). For more information on <em>Specimen Days</em>, see George Hutchinson and David Drews "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_54.html"><em>Specimen Days</em> [1882]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed.

   <p id="n0262">3. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <p id="loc.01243_n1">4. George Hukin was a
      razor-grinder, fellow political activist, and lover of Carpenter.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
