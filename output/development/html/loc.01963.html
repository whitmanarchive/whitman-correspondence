      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was very much delighted some weeks ago to receive a copy of the New Republic with
      a
      little memorandum in your handwriting. Time does not diminish my reverential
      admiration for your work, nor do the unintelligent remarks of the English press
      deter me from giving expression to the same in print. I hope soon to have an
      opportunity of explaining at large, in a new series of critical studies of the Greek
      Poets, what I meant in the little note alluded to by the reviewer of the Quarterly,
      &amp; to show how it is only by adopting an attitude of mind similar to yours that
      we can in this age be in true unity with whatever great &amp; natural &amp; human
       has been
      handed to us from the past.—
   </p>
   
   <p>I was the more pleased to have this communication from you, because I feared that
      the
      last time I wrote to you I might perhaps have spoken something amiss. I
      then—it was about three years ago, I think,—sent you a poem called
      "Callicrates" &amp; asked you questions about "Calamus." Pray believe me that I only
      refer to this circumstance now in order to explain the reason why since that time
      I
      have kept silence from a fear I might have been importunate or ill-advised in what
      I
      wrote. There was really no reason why you should have noticed that communication;
      &amp; it gives me great  satisfaction to feel that your friendly remembrance of me is not
      diminished.—
   </p>
   
   <p>Now, though late, I may express the deep sorrow with which I heard of your illness.
      How Whitman must have borne such a trial, no one knows better than one who like
      myself has learned to have absolute faith in his manliness and vigour of Soul. Yet
      it is not the less sad to think that he who could enjoy life so fully, has met with
      this impediment.—
   </p>
   
   <p>I look forward with a keen foretaste of delight to your new volume announced.</p>

      Believe me ever gratefully and indebtedly yours
      <br></br>John Addington Symonds.—

   <p>I should have written earlier had I not been moving rapidly from place to place
      during an Italian journey.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
