   <p>Spring has at last commenced.<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r1">1</a></sup> The buds are out on the trees, the early flowers are in bloom, the days have grown
      to a much greater length, the fields of rye and wheat show their beautiful carpet
      of emerald, the farmers are busy planting their corn and potatoes, and all Nature
      exhibits the plainest evidencs that the delightful season for flowers, vegetables, fruits, grains, and the foliage
      of Summer is again commencing.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Common as it is in the experience of every one of us, nothing is more wonderful than
      the annual return of spring: The dead ground awakening by some mysterious process
      to all the miracles of life is a spectacle, common as it is, not surpassed in all
      the infinite processes of the Universe.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Amid these wonders and glories, the passions and ambitions of mankind and the objects
      of their pride and eagerness seem artificial and petty. There is a healthy and elevating
      lesson in studying the spring.

   <p>We have had a couple of rainy Apriel. It is now a fine evening, partially clear, with an occasionals gust of wind, it and the moon at times shining out brightly. Mr Whitman and I are
      sitting here in the room togeather; he is reading the New York Herald, and I am writing these lines for exercise for
      exercise. To day we received a newspaper from our friend the artist George Waters<sup><a href="#n0685" id="r2">2</a></sup> of Elmira N.Y. It contained an article on W. W. portrait, painted by Mr. Waters during
      our late visit to New York; also an interesting extract from the last letter writen by our lamented hostess, the very day before her sudden death. Of corse we were glad to here from our friend, though the newspaper and letter brought up some very sad recollections

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0590">1. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0685">2. George W. Waters (1832–1912) was a portrait
      and landscape painter. He sketched Whitman at least once and gave the sketch to
      Mrs. Alma Calder Johnston, who frequently hosted both Waters and Whitman in her
      New York home.<a href="#r2">[back]
