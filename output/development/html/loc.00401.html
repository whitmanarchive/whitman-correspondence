      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Much to our joy and surprise George made his appearance among us on Sunday morning.<sup><a href="#loc.00401_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> He arrived home about 11 O<em>ck</em> on Saturday night but we all happened to be abed and he did not wake us up but went
      to his room and made himself shown at about 8
      <em>ock</em>
       in the morning &nbsp;He is well and looking first rate, pretty well played out as regards
      cloths, but we will fix him up in that respect this afternoon &nbsp;He wants me to ask
      you if you can find out if he can get his pay in New York and if so at what office
      and hour. Please find out what you can about it and answer me at once. He has some $500 coming to him and would
      like to get it here if he can. Please write me at once will you Walt.
   </p>
   
   <p>Of course we were all wonderfully glad to see him. I think he looks well. He certainly
      is well pleased with his position and I think it would be hard to get him to leave
      it.<sup><a href="#loc.00401_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> He could only get 10 days and that will hardly be time for him to see and shake hands
      with all his friends. 'Tis a pity it could not have been for 20 or 30 days, it certainly
      ought to have been.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all in our usual good health. Mother, George says looks younger than when he
      went away. I think she looks better than when you left. Mattie, Sis and the rest are all well.
   </p>
   
   <p>I received a long letter from you Saturday. I like much to hear from you &nbsp; you must
      write often. About your office hunting<sup><a href="#loc.00401_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &nbsp;I suppose you will have to wait a long time before it amounts to anything but patience
      will bring something undoubtedly
   </p>
   
   <p>Hoping to hear from you immediately, I remain</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <p id="loc.00401_n1">1. George briefly mentions
      this furlough at home from March 7 to March 17, 1863, in his .<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00401_n2">2. Army life agreed with
      George. He had held the rank of captain since November 1, 1862, and after the
      war he attempted unsuccessfully to secure a commission as a captain in the
      regular standing army (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <em>Civil War
         Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, N.C.: Duke University
      Press, 1975], 6, 26).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.00401_n3">3. Jeff refers to Walt's
      letter of , only part of which is
      extant. Earlier, on , Walt had
      described his efforts to find employment in Washington: "(it is very amusing to
      hunt for an office—so the thing seems to me just now—even if one don't get it)—I
      have seen Charles Sumner three times—he says every thing here moves as part of a
      great machine, and that I must consign myself to the fate of the
      rest....Meantime I make about enough to pay my expenses by hacking on the press
      here, and copying in the paymasters offices."<a href="#r3">[back]
