      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Old Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I must thank you very cordially for your great kindness in sending me the p.c. of
      Decr 19<u>th</u> 1890 which I received on New Year's Day.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I cannot tell you how heart-strong I am to learn that at the time of writing it you
      were so poorly, + I sincerely hope that by this time you are feeling better, + are
      freer from the pain + distress of those internal complications which trouble you. While I was saddened
      by the knowledge that you were suffering physical pain I was deeply touched by the
      fact that in the midst of it all you should kindly think of me + write me such a
      tender + loving note, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for this act of
      self-denying thoughtful friendliness which I regard as a signal proof of your
      affection for me. God bless you for this + for everything else I owe to you!
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>The other day I received a letter from Mrs Harrison of Bideford to whom I sent a copy
      of my "Notes"—she is a daughter of the late Charles Kingsley<sup><a href="#n0137" id="r1">1</a></sup> + writes under the <u>nom de plume</u> of
      "Lucas Malet"—in which she says: "It is most interesting to get fresh, first-hand impressions of a
      man whom one so deeply admires as I admire Walt Whitman. He is too big, too
      unconventional, ever to become popular, I fancy, either here or in the United
      States. But his thought, filtered through the minds of those few who admire + love
      him, may help to 'leaven the lump,' I hope, as time goes on. I read him with
      increasing sympathy +, I think, profit. But he writes in a language of his own +
      must be understood in a sense <u>of</u> his own;"
   </p>
   
   <p>I sent a traced copy of your p.c. to Mr. Wallace<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r2">2</a></sup> + he will
      probably write to you
   </p>
   
   
   <p>By the way it may amuse you to know that in consequence of the extent of my "Whitman
      correspondence" he has jokingly dubbed me "Organising Secretary of the International
      Whitman Society!"
   </p>
   
   <p>We had a pleasant New Year's Day here—a hard frost with crisp, clean
      atmosphere. There is a great Carnival on New Year's Eve among the Bolton people who
      assemble in thousands on the [illegible]
      Square—the great central open space in the town—to listen to the band
      which plays on the Town Hall steps from 11-15pm until after midnight + upon the last
      stroke of 12 everybody wishes everybody else a "Happy New Year," the band then playing "Hail,
      Smiling morn!" + afterwards "Auld Lang Syne," the "Hallelujah Chorus" + "God Save
      the Queen." Then the "fair" begins and the Saturnalia last three days
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you all received the Christmas papers I sent + that they afforded you a little
      amusement.
   </p>
   
   <p>I notice a paragraph in this week's <u>Academy</u>(London)
      announcing that you are now engaged in the preparation of your new volume, <u>Farewell, My Fancy!</u></p>
   
   <p>There is a loan collection of pictures on exhibition at a newly opened museum here + this
      afternoon our Librarian suggested that I should send 
      Sydney
      
       Morse's<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r3">3</a></sup> large portrait of <u>you</u> to it.
   </p>
   
   <p>In the syllabus of the "Bolton Internation Club" I notice that Mr Duncan is put down
      to give a paper on "Walt Whitman" in April next.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr Wallace<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r4">4</a></sup> has just been here for half an hour's chat after
      posting his letter to you. He tells me that he has also sent you a copy of the <u>Manchester Weekly Times</u> containing an article on Bolton which I intended
      sending to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>And now as it is close upon mail time I must bring this letter to an end by again
      expressing the hope that you are keeping better + sending you my heartiest sympathy
      + good wishes + wishing you all a "Happy New Year"
   </p>
   
   <p>With best regards to all your household + with heart-love to yourself</p>
