      <br></br><br></br>My dear Rudolf Schmidt<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n0793" id="r1">1</a></sup>,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As you have 
      rec'd
      
       my letter of April 25, you know that the copies of <em>Demokratisk–Fremblik</em><sup><a href="#n0189" id="r2">2</a></sup> and of some six newspapers with
      criticisms, safely reached me here—&amp; one or two more since—&amp; now,
      yesterday, <em>Dags Telegrafen</em><sup><a href="#rlc.00011_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>—all of
      which I treasure, &amp; am to have carefully read to me. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still unwell enough to make me remain here, quite idle, but am encouraged to
      still
      keep up the expectation of getting quite well—&amp; indeed am improving, though
      slowly—I enclose a piece of mine just written for Commencement Poem to a College near
      Boston city—the College is the headquarters of the Universalists—my piece is to
      be read by proxy—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I enclose you some pieces more on <em>American humor</em>, as you are
      interested in that subject—&amp; a very amusing &amp; 'cute letter by a lady about the
      darkeys down South—American humor, (like the old Greek, and now the best Italian,
      Spanish, French humor) is, in a sense <em>the other side or opposite radiation
         of pensiveness, &amp; even mystery &amp; hypochondria</em>—I think it more
      idiosyncratic &amp; untranslatable than any I have mentioned, Greek, Italian,
      &amp;c—It is <em>entirely different</em> from the English, or
      English–German<sup><a href="#rlc.00011_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have been having one of our American hot–weather spells—real
      hell–blasts—here lately—four, five, six days. But I have stood them very
      well indeed. 
      To–day
      
       as I sit here writing by the open window, there is a sufficiently cool breeze,
      &amp; it is very agreeable &amp; moderate, though just past noon. When you write mention
      whether you 
      rec'd
      
      
      <em>Redwood Tree</em><sup><a href="#n0578" id="r5">5</a></sup> and also <em>Prayer of Columbus</em><sup><a href="#n0482" id="r6">6</a></sup>, both sent March 4. (The <em>address</em> on the last
      papers &amp; letters to me is exactly right, &amp; is sure to reach me.) I intend to send
      Kristian Elster<sup><a href="#n0216" id="r7">7</a></sup> a copy of my poems, &amp; my photograph—how shall
      I address him? John Burroughs has been to visit me here—he is settled on a little
      farm
      of his own on the Hudson river, 60 miles north of New York city. Your photo. sent
      in the
      letter of April 4 is before me as I write.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0793">1. Rudolf Schmidt, a Dane and
      editor of <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em>, is credited with
      introducing Walt Whitman to Scandinavia by quoting translated passages from <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in a 1872 essay in his magazine. He wrote
      to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871:
      "I intend to write
      an article about yourself and your writings in the above named periodical which
      is very much read in all the Scandinavian countries. ... I therefore take the
      liberty to ask you, if you should not be willing to afford some new
      communications of yourself and your poetry to this purpose" (The Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0189">2. Rudolph Schmidt translated Whitman's <em>Democratic Vistas</em> into Danish in 1871.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00011_n1">3. Roos notes that the conservative <em>Dags Telegrafen</em> criticized <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em> on May 20, 1874; see <em>Orbis Litterarum</em>, 7
      (1949), 53n.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00011_n2">4. In acknowledging receipt of the poems and
      other items sent to him, Schmidt commented on : "But your humorists of the day I don't like. Mark Twain has been
      translated into Danish this year. He is a detestable fool."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0578">5. In a ,
      letter, Walt Whitman offered "Song of the Redwood-Tree" to Henry M. Alden,
      editor of <em>Harper's Monthly Magazine</em>. Of "Song of the
      Redwood-Tree" Rudolf Schmidt observed: "It is your old great theme in a simple
      and powerful stile, embracing the holy and original nation of the far West"
      (Syracuse University; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], 4:464). For digital images of the poem as it
      appeared in <em>Harper's Monthly Magazine</em>, see "."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0482">6. Having successfully submitted "Song of the
      Redwood-Tree" to <em>Harper's New Monthly Magazine</em> on , Walt Whitman submitted a second
      poem, "Prayer of Columbus," later in , also for $60. Editor Henry Mills Alden (1836–1919) accepted
      the poem on  (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection); it appeared in the March 1874 edition, XLVIII (1874),
      524–525. In reprinting the poem on February 24, 1874, the New York <em>Tribune</em> commented that it "shows the brawny vigor, but
      not the reckless audacity, by which the name of that wild poet has become best
      known to the public." For digital images of the poem as it appeared in <em>Harper's New Monthly Magazine</em>, see "."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0216">7. Kristian Elster (1841–1881) was a Norwegian
      novelist whose work focused on cultural conflict, as in his 1872 pamphlet "On
      the contrast between the western and the eastern parts of Norway." According to
      Carl Roos, Elster was a friend of Björnstjerne Björnson (1832–1910),
      Norwegian poet, dramatist, and novelist; see <em>Orbis
         Litterarum</em>, VII (1949), 51n.<a href="#r7">[back]
