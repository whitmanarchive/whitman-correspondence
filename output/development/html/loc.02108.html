      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. President,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Hoping, (should time &amp; inclination favor,) to give you a moment's diversion from the
      weight of official 
      &amp; political cares—&amp; thinking, of all men, you can return to those scenes, in the vein
      I have written 
      about them—I take the liberty of sending, (same mail with this) some reminiscences
      I have printed 
      about the war, in nos. of the N. Y. <u>Weekly Graphic</u>.<sup><a href="#loc.02108_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>  
   
   
   <p>I am not sure you will remember me, or my occasional salute to you, in Washington.
      I am laid up here with tedious paralysis,—but think I shall get well &amp; return to Washington.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Very respectfully
      <br></br>Walt Whitman
