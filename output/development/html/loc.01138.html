   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01138_n1">1. Whitman met Dr. Richard
      Maurice Bucke and Thomas Nicholson in Jersey City on July 23, and went to
      Woodside, Long Island, where he stayed with Helen and Arthur Price until July
      28. He spent the following four days at West Hills near Huntington. On August 1
      he went to New York City, where he stayed with Edgar M. Smith, listed in the
      directory as a secretary, until August 6 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). See also <em>Specimen Days</em> (ed.
      Floyd Stovall [New York: New York University Press, 1963], 273). In <em>The Long Islander</em>, on August 5, a lengthy article
      appeared on the poet by Mary E. Wager-Fisher, who drew upon an earlier piece in
      <em>Wide Awake Pleasure Book</em>, 6 (February 1878),
      109–115, in which she was greatly indebted to Whitman. In an adjacent
      column of the same issue of the newspaper was a report titled "Walt Whitman in
      Huntington."<a href="#r1">[back]
