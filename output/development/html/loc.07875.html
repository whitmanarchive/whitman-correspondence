      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>For many days I have tried to write you, but the pressure is so great that I can't
      
      get the moment to sit down, for as yet I am the only nurse, &amp; my duties are 
      constant, much of the time.  If things get worse I shall have to have a man 
      
      to help me lift &amp; nurse William<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup>. This morning after your card 
      came<sup><a href="#loc.07875_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> he asked 
      me to write &amp; tell you how very ill he is.  The attack he had on the 18<u>th</u> was 
      less severe than the one a year ago on the 16<u>th</u> of Jan. but he is so much worse 
      in all other ways, &amp;
      
      the lower limbs so useless that all is harder for him.  He feels discouraged for the
      first 
      tim, &amp; says the outlook is very gloomy.  His constant annoyance from the bladder 
      trouble now is worse than all else, &amp; so far the Doctors have not reached it at all.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r3">3</a></sup> comes in soon can he not, will he not, be able to run over &amp; call on 
      us?  I am sure he could advise me how to nurse &amp; care for William in the best hospital
      
      manner, —as yet he has not at all come to the idea that any one but me is needed,
      
      — &amp; I don't mean to suggest it till I
      
      have come to the point where I <u>must</u>, &amp; can't do for him, 
      but he is very helpless &amp; very heavy.
   </p> 
   
   <p>I try to keep my courage up, &amp; not to look ahead more than I must.</p>
   
   <p>William sends love, &amp; is always glad to hear. He can read but not write.</p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With all best wishes, &amp; with love—
      <br></br>Nelly O'Connor.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>At this moment he is dressed &amp; sitting up reading, but feeling very 
      quiet, &amp; very silent.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor
      was the wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Walt Whitman's
      staunchest defenders. Walt may have mentioned a potential visit by Nelly and her
      daughter during his May visit to Brooklyn, though whether a visit came near this
      time is not known from his or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters. Walt Whitman
      dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington years, and he spoke
      often in his letters of their daughter Jean (called "Jenny" or "Jeannie").
      Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break off their friendship in late
      1872 over a disagreement about Reconstruction policies and the role of
      emancipated slaves, Nelly would remain friendly with Whitman. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n2002">1. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
