   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00351_n1">1. 
      This postcard bears the address, "Pete Doyle, | M street South, bet 4½ &amp;
      6th | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Aug | 7 | N.J.; Carrier
      | 8 | Aug | 8 AM."<br><br>
      The dating of this postcard as well as the notes and letters to Doyle on , August , , and , 1874, depends in part on Whitman's habit of writing on
      Fridays. However, as evidenced in Whitman's  letter to Ellen O'Connor and his  letter to John and Ursula Burroughs, both of which were
      conclusively written in 1874, Whitman's "alternations" were especially
      marked during the summer of this year, and despite his "natural buoyancy" he
      was frequently depressed by the inability of his once healthy body to
      triumph over his ailments.<a href="#r1">[back]

      Louisa to Atlantic City was mentioned in Whitman's  letter to Ellen O'Connor.<a href="#r2">[back]
