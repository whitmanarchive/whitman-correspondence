   <p>I appreciate the "Dogberry" article not only for its bearing on me &amp; my

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00442_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      J L &amp; J B Gilder | Critic office | 30 Lafayette Place | New York City. It is
      postmarked: Philadelphia | Jun | 3 | 9 PM | Pa.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00442_n2">2. Payment for "Edgar Poe's
      Significance," which appeared in <em>The Critic</em> on this date;
      included in <em>Specimen Days</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall (New York:
      New York University Press, 1963), 230–233.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00442_n3">3. "The Massachusetts
      Dogberry," an editorial in <em>The Critic</em> on June 3, was
      indeed a "razor-edged" attack on the Boston censors of <em>Leaves
         of Grass</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00442_n4">4. <em>Essays
         from "The Critic"</em> contained Whitman's "Death of Carlyle" and "Death of
      Longfellow" as well as an anonymous chapter entitled "Whitman's 'Leaves of
      Grass,'" in which the author judiciously appraised Whitman's poetry as "truly
      caviare to the multitude," defended the sexual poems, deplored Whitman's "lack
      of taste" in the use of foreign phrases, and compared him to Richard
      Wagner.<a href="#r4">[back]
