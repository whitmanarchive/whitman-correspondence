      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Instead of coming by boat, I came by the midnight train on Friday, &amp; got here
      about 7 on Saturday morning. Since then I have been to Concord &amp; discussed the
      New Poetry. The meeting took place after all in Dr. Emerson's house,  instead of his
      father's. Old Mrs. Emerson (who is 85 years old, they tell me,) &amp; Ellen
      Emerson,<sup><a href="#loc.03320_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> formed part of the audience which though
      small was perhaps as remarkable as any I am ever likely to have. The discussion
      after my paper, in which Sanborn<sup><a href="#n0915" id="r2">2</a></sup> took a main part, was full of interest, &amp; there
      was a general agreement with my position, &amp; that part based on Leaves of Grass
      in especial. Mrs. Talcott Williams<sup><a href="#loc.05142_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup> gave me on Thursday
      evening two pictures of your house, inside &amp; out, one 
      shewing
          
       you seated by the window; &amp; on Sanborn's suggestion I took these to 
      shew
      
       to the people at the lecture, who were quite delighted with the glimpse of
      you thus given.
   </p>
   
   <p>I stayed until this morning with the Sanborns, &amp; found them endlessly kind. They
      were anxious to hear all about you. Sanborn himself may come to see you soon, when
      passing through Philadelphia.  Yesterday morning he drove me round by Lincoln &amp; other
      pleasant rustic places. It was so fine that I wish you could have been with us. In
      the afternoon Dr. Emerson drove me to Walden Pond again; &amp; in the evening I met
      Channing<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> (who as you know is morbidly shy.) &amp; had a quiet talk at Sanborn's snug
      fireside, with its blazing logs to make good cheer.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <p id="loc.03320_n1">1. He is referring to Lidian
      Jackson Emerson (1802–1892), the second wife of Ralph Waldo Emerson, and
      two of their children: physician and writer Edward Waldo Emerson
      (1844–1930) as well as Ellen Emerson (1839–1909), named after Ralph
      Waldo Emerson's first wife.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0915">2. Franklin B. Sanborn
      (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
      he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
      the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
      reviewed <em>Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Boston
         Commonwealth</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00059.html">February 24, 1866</a>. He was editor of the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
      his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
      appeared without Sanborn's name in the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K. Walker,

   <p id="loc.05142_n5">3. Talcott Williams
      (1849–1928) was associated with the New York <em>Sun</em>
      and <em>World</em> as well as the Springfield <em>Republican</em> before he became the editor of the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in 1879. His newspaper vigorously defended Whitman
      in news articles and editorials after the Boston censorship of 1882. For more
      information about Williams, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_108.html">Williams, Talcott (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="loc.00945_n5">4. William F. Channing
      (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
      Whitman stayed at his home in October, 1868.<a href="#r4">[back]
