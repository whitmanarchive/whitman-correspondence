      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your letter—also one from Jeffy. I wrote to Jeffy yesterday—I
      suppose it is for the best that he should go to St. Louis
      <sup><a href="#duk.00648_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      —as it seems to be a great position—I was
      much pleased to hear that it was Mr. Kirkwood
      <sup><a href="#duk.00648_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      who was the designing Engineer—&amp; also that
      Davis
      <sup><a href="#duk.00648_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> is to
      go to St. Louis on the works—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, mother, about domestic matters—I hardly know what to say at
      present—Jeff did not say in his letter what was proposed, or how he &amp; Mat
      thought of doing—I can tell better after I hear—But, Mother, you must
      not worry about it—it will be arranged some way—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing new in my affairs—I have a little more work these days than
      usual, but get along first rate—am satisfied with the boarding-house as well
      as could be expected. Love to you &amp; all, dear mother. I write this at my
      desk—spring is quite advanced here—it is a damp, misty, cloudy
      forenoon—but pleasant—I can send you whatever money you need, dear
      mother, any time—or can come on for a few days—try to take things
      coolly.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
