   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="har.00057_n1">1. The year of this letter
      is uncertain but seems to follow an  letter
      from Whitman to O'Connor, where Whitman writes about Nelly O'Connor's "getting
      off" on a trip.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="har.00057_n2">2. John Townsend
      Trowbridge visited Whitman in Washington a number of times, beginning in
      1863.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="har.00057_n3">3. Alonzo Newton was a
      close family friend of Trowbridge, and the "Mr. Newton" here may be Alonzo or
      another member of the Newton family. See John Townsend Trowbridge, <em>My Own Story</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1903),
      265–67.<a href="#r3">[back]
