   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>

      This postcard bears the address, "Pete Doyle | M Street South | bet 4½ &amp;
      6th— | Washington | D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Dec | 20 |
      N.J."<br><br>
      Although the executors dated this postcard 1878, 1876 seems more plausible;
      note the similar phraseology in Whitman's  letter to Doyle and the reference to the weather in
      Whitman's  letter to
      Mannahatta and Jessie Whitman. In 1877 the weather late in December,
      according to his Commonplace Book, was perfect, and Walt Whitman visited the
      Gilchrists almost daily. In 1878 there is no indication in Whitman's
      Commonplace Book (kept by the poet as a diary, a memorandum, and account
      book, this bound manuscript notebook dates from March 1876 to 30 May 1889)
      that Whitman wrote to Doyle, or that the weather kept Whitman indoors (note
      Whitman's  letter to
      John Burroughs, in which Whitman wrote of going out despite "a sharp spell
      of cold &amp; gusty winds here these days"). Probably Doyle had answered
      Whitman's  letter.<a href="#r1">[back]

      old Washington friends of Whitman and Doyle. The poet stayed at their home in
      1875 (see Whitman's  letter to
      Ellen O'Connor).<a href="#r2">[back]
