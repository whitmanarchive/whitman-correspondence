      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter Sunday morning last—It has been very cold here too, but is pleasant
      now. I sent you a copy of "Leaves of Grass"—which I suppose you have rec'd. Every
      thing here with me remains the same—I am free from the distress in my head—Mrs. Grayson<sup><a href="#nyp.00214_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> is very sick—she sent my old washerwoman, old Aunt Kitty, around this morning to
      see if I had any of "that bread my mother used to send me"—I suppose she meant the
      sweet Dyer bread—I gave her a piece a long while ago, &amp; she liked it—poor woman, I
      think she is on her dying bed—Mother, you must write to me how Jeff is, &amp; how he is
      getting along—tell Hattie I hope she will take a lesson on the piano every day, and
      learn to play for her Uncle Walt—so when he comes home, she can play a beautiful tune<sup><a href="#nyp.00214_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been down to the Hospital a great deal lately—A friend of mine that I have
      known over three years, a Maine soldier named Racliffe,<sup><a href="#nyp.00214_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> was very low with consumption &amp; bleeding at the lungs—He died Sunday morning—it was
      a great relief, for he suffered much—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, mother, I believe that is all this time.</p>
