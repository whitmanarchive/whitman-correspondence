   <p>Condition tolerable—I keep good heart yet—have no doubt I shall be able to come to
      Wash[ington]—but <em>when</em>, don't know now—John Bur[roughs] was here last night to see me, on his way to Wash[ington]—hope
      you are all right—do you like the berth?—papers, card, &amp;c. rec'd—Can't you come on, 
      &amp; get back to Balt[imore] in time?

      This postcard bears the address, "Pete Doyle, | M street South—bet 4½
      &amp; M. | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Apr | 16 | N.J.;
      Carrier | 17 | Apr | 8 (?) AM."<br><br>
      The correspondence (again chiefly postcards) with Doyle in April and May was
      sent on Fridays, according to Whitman's habit. At this time Doyle was
      working out of Baltimore; note Whitman's , and  letters to
      Doyle. This postcard can be positively dated on the basis of Burroughs'
      visit; see his letter to Dowden on May 4, 1875, quoted by Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston:
      Houghton Mifflin, 1931), 94.<a href="#r1">[back]
