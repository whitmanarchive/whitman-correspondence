   <p>Nothing very notable or different. Your letters rec'd &amp; welcomed—<em>Transcript</em> also—hearty thanks for y'r services &amp;
      promptness in conveying the books—yes I will leave you to pay express
      tax—but I had meant to refund—I have rec'd from every one letters of
      acknowledgm't &amp;c. (Mrs: Fairchild's<sup><a href="#har.00049_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> to you is here
      enclosed return'd)—Baxter's<sup><a href="#n6000" id="r2">2</a></sup> splended notice &amp;
      setting-forth of the book, in <em>Herald</em> of last Thursday,<sup><a href="#duk.00909_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> is
      rec'd, &amp; seems to me the most complete &amp; most friendly &amp; penetrating
      (from the point of view of an absorber, believer &amp; democrat) I have ever
      had—Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> will have a good time over it—I hear
      from B often—he is well, busied with his large family, with the Asylum, &amp;
      with that <em>meter invention</em><sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> I suppose you have heard of.
      O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r6">6</a></sup> keeps on, but is badly off I fear. Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r7">7</a></sup> is pretty well—We have had a long stretch of the finest
      weather, but to-day is dark &amp; wet &amp; glum enough—but I feel
      comparatively comfortable. I live on mutton-broth &amp; milk &amp; dry
      toast—sit up most of the day—have read Tolstoi<sup><a href="#n6178" id="r8">8</a></sup> &amp; (it seems to me)
      all Carlyle's<sup><a href="#n0139" id="r9">9</a></sup> letters—&amp; have enough. Much obliged with the <em>Trans</em>[<em>cript</em>] ¶ on big book<sup><a href="#duk.00909_n1" id="r10">10</a></sup>—

   <p>All continues well—glum weather, however—I am sitting here by the oak

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="har.00049_n3">1. Elizabeth Fairchild was
      the wife of Colonel Charles Fairchild, the president of a paper company, to whom
      Whitman sent the Centennial Edition on March 2, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). He mailed her husband a
      copy of <em>Progress</em> in April, 1881, shortly after his visit
      to Boston, where he probably met the Fairchilds for the first time (Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6000">2. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="duk.00909_n2">3. Sylvester Baxter's review of
      Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em>, entitled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/complete_poems/anc.00131.html">Whitman's Complete Works</a>," appeared in the <em>Boston
         Herald</em> on Thursday, January 3, 1889.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.07230_n2">5. Bucke and his brother-in-law
      William John Gurd were designing a gas and fluid meter to be patented in Canada
      and sold in England.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">6. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">7. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n6178">8. Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy
      (1828–1910) was a Russian realist writer of novels, plays, short stories
      and novellas.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0139">9. Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) was a Scottish
      writer who wrote frequently on the conflict between scientific changes and the
      traditional social (often religious) order. For Whitman's writings on Carlyle in
      <em>Specimen Days</em>, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf087v1">Death of Thomas Carlyle</a>" and "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf088v1">Carlyle from American Points of View</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00909_n1">10. Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), a volume Whitman often referred to
      as the "big book," was published in December 1888. With the help of Horace
      Traubel, he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick
      Oldach bound the book, which included a profile photo of the poet on the title
      page. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em> Kennedy's notice in the Boston <em>Evening Transcript</em> on December 29, 1888, served as an (unpaid)
      advertisement for the book rather than a balanced review.<a href="#r10">[back]
