      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Yesterday was indeed a day, for almost every post brought me despatches in your familiar hand which it always gives me a thrill to see.
      First came the two postcards, then the copy of <u>Specimen Days</u> &amp; the Camden paper, last the letter which I found waiting on returning at midnight
      
      from a journalistic excursion to Fleet Street—where I completed an account of a great
      fire which has been raging just opposite here in a timber wharf
      for two days &amp; nights,—a most lurid spectacle, with the old Thames as reflector!
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I must not decide off-hand about the <u>Specimen Days</u>,—that is, whether to make two vols. as you suggest, or to try
      &amp; get the whole into one. In the latter case, the book would be rather crowded. We
      put much less into most of the 'Camelots,' than there is in <u>
         King Arthur</u>, &amp; give them much larger print, &amp; I want to have you shewn as brightly &amp; impressively
      as possible in point of typography, &amp;c.
      On the other hand the publishers might not be willing to issue the 2nd vol., supposing
      we divide, very soon. I will consult with Gordon<sup><a href="#loc.03316_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> to-day, &amp; you shall hear
      at once when the matter is settled.
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I do hope that by this you have decided to send off the extra words of introduction!
      They would give the book an added "send" into the midst of our readers &amp; do a deal
      of good so. But I know how things
      are with you, &amp; do not want to give you more trouble than can be helped. For the two
      addtional photos, many, may thanks! I will see what Gordon says about putting
      the portrait in at p. 122. In such a cheap series we have to be careful about first
      cost &amp; this hampers us very much.—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      No! I would not think of putting the copy of <u>Specimen Days</u> with your corrections into the printer's hands and will get copies 
      from Wilson of Glasow<sup><a href="#loc.03316_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>, carefully following all your deletions &amp; so on. It is one of the greatest prizes
      I possess, &amp; someday a sense of its value will
      inspire me, I'm afraid, to beg you to send me a copy of <u>Leaves of Grass</u> too with your name in it, (&amp; mine, as proof of ownership) &amp; 
      some further inscription as well. You see what it is to give the inch; now I am coolly
      asking the ell. Most of all
      though, I feel very powerfully impelled to come over to the States this year, for
      myself. Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r3">3</a></sup> pressed me to do so again last week, &amp; things have been working in that direction
      for some time now. W. S. Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r4">4</a></sup> has asked me to stay with him too, &amp; there are other friends. If I came, I should
      have to send letters to the papers here, &amp; 
      perhaps lecture too, to pay my way; for you know the usual straits of a young scribe!
      I come to my last halfpenny indeed almost every week, &amp; am getting quite 
      used to the condition at last. It educates one's faculties &amp; sympathies tremendously.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I expect Gordon will send off the ten guineas at once. I ask him to do so to-day.
      They shall be sent by P. O. order as you direct to 328 Mickle St.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03316_n1">1. David Gordon was a
      bookbinder who was appointed the managing editor of The Walter Scott Publishing
      Company based in London and Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Although he had little
      education, the Scottish editor soon became a driving force in the company's
      success, creating some of its most well-known editions, such as the Canterbury
      Poets Series, the Camelot Classics Series, the Great Writers Series, and the
      Contemporary Science Series. Whitman's 1886 English edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> was published by Scott and advertised by Rhys as
      Whitman's entry into the "Canterbury Poets" series.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03316_n2">2. Frederick W. Wilson was a
      member of the Glasgow firm of Wilson &amp; McCormick that published the 1883
      British edition of <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">4. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
