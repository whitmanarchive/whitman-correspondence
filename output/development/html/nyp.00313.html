      <br></br><br></br>Dear mother<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n0705" id="r1">1</a></sup>,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I got your letter yesterday Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's letter of March 4, 1873,
      
      dealt mostly with Jeff and his children (Trent Collection, Duke University).
      —I was glad to hear all the things you wrote— every thing,
      however little, is interesting, when you are kept in nearly all the time— I
      have rec'd a very good letter from Hannah this morning—she writes in good
      spirits, &amp; wants you &amp; me to come up there next Summer Hannah, as Walt Whitman observed, wrote "in good
      spirits" on March 4, 1873, to her mother and to her brother—no whining, no
      hypochondriacal wailing, and no reports about Heyde's behavior (Trent
      Collection, Duke University). —says Heyde thinks of going off then
      to the Adirondack, on a trip— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To-day is very pleasant indeed—the cold spell seems to be over for the
      present— I have been out (about noon) quite a while—Mrs. O'Connor<sup><a href="#n0450" id="r2">2</a></sup> came to visit me, &amp; as I was all dressed, &amp; it was so
      pleasant, I went out—she convoyed me— I didn't go far, but stopt in at
      one or two places, near by—have now returned, have just eat a bite of lunch,
      and am feeling quite comfortable— sit here now alone writing this—as I
      told you in my last, I am getting along well, but it is very, very slow—I
      cannot begin to apply my brain to regular work yet— though, for all that, I
      have written two or three little poems for the <em>Graphic</em>,
      The New York <em>Daily Graphic</em> published a number of Walt
      Whitman's poems and prose pieces in 1873 and 1874. In the former year the
      <em>Daily Graphic</em> printed the following works: "Nay,
      Tell Me Not To-day the Publish'd Shame" on , "With All the Gifts, America" on , "The Singing Thrush" (later entitled "Wandering at
      Morn") on , "Spain" on , "Sea Captains, Young or Old"
      (later called "Song for All Seas, All Ships") on , "Warble for Lilac-Time" on May 12, 1873, "Halls of
      Gold and Lilac" on November 24, 1873, and "Silver and Salmon-Tint" on
      November 29, 1873. In 1874, the <em>Daily Graphic</em> printed
      "A Kiss to the Bride" on , "Song
      of the Universal" on , and "An
      Old Man's Thought of School" on . <br><br>
      David G. Croly (1829–1889) was editor of the <em>Graphic</em> until 1878. From 1862 to 1872 he had been managing editor
      of the New York <em>World</em>, a newspaper which had been
      sympathetic to Walt Whitman. Croly, described in <em>Dictionary of American Biography</em> as "an iconoclast and a
      reformer," was the author of <em>Miscegenation</em> (1864),
      which proposed the blending of the two races for the survival of
      civilization. See also Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1964), 5 vols., 3:560–561. 
       a N. Y. daily evening paper just commenced—(one of them was in the
      number for last Wednesday)—they pay me moderately— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was glad you got a letter from Mary Mary Van Nostrand, Walt Whitman's sister. On March 4, 1873,
       Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman expressed hope that she and Walt Whitman could visit Mary during the
      summer: "i think it would doo us both good, so we must both get so we can walk
      without limping" (Trent Collection, Duke University). —if you write
      tell her I am improving— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>John Burroughs is just in to see me, having returned for a while to Washington— </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, mother dear, I will bid you good bye for this week—Love to you &amp; to
      Brother George<sup><a href="#n0700" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; Sister Lou<sup><a href="#n0368" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; all—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0450">2. For a time Walt Whitman lived with William D. and
      Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to
      be his close associates during the early Washington years. William Douglas
      O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good
      Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In 1872 Whitman
      and William strongly disagreed on the Fifteenth Amendment, which Whitman opposed
      and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended Whitman's opinion, and in response
      William moved out. The correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost
      as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0700">3. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0368">4. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
