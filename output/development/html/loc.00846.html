   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Apparently George Wood
      (1799â€“1870), who went to the Treasury Department as a clerk in 1822 and
      held various posts in that bureau until his death. He was the author of several
      satirical works, <em>Peter Schlemihl in America</em>
      (Philadelphia: Carey and Hart, 1848) and <em>The Gates Wide Open;
         or, Scenes in Another World</em> (Boston: Lee and Shepard, 1858; rev. ed.
      1870); see <em>National Cyclopaedia of American Biography</em>.
      Undoubtedly he became acquainted with Whitman through William and Ellen
      O'Connor. Ellen mentions a Mr. Wood in her letter of , (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). See also Wood's
      letter to Whitman of  and
