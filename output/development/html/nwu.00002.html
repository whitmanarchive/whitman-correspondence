      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sister Lou
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I still remain well—Am out here in Concord on a visit<sup><a href="#nwu.00002_n6" id="r1">1</a></sup>—spent last evening with 
      Mr
      
       Emerson very pleasantly indeed—am to take dinner with him
      to-day—Every thing very agreeable here—I am at F B
      Sanborn's—(the little picture at the top is the house)<sup><a href="#nwu.00002_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—as I write (Sunday forenoon 11 o'clock) I look out
      on the Concord river—something like the Schuylkill—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The book is almost finished—I am on the last pages of the proof—will be
      ready in the stores 
      ab't
      
       last of October—will be issued first in England, to secure the
      copyright there—as that is required, &amp; I consider it important—Shall
      leave here (Boston) in about ten days—(perhaps less)<sup><a href="#nwu.00002_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—expect to stop in New York probably a week or so, &amp; then on
      home—I sent your letter to Mrs. Gilchrist—I have not written
      yet—it is so sudden &amp; dreadful<sup><a href="#nwu.00002_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I thought
      I would wait a while—rec'd
       your letter &amp; as always was glad to get it—it is a sunny, Indian
      summery spell of weather here now, cool enough, but just suits me—I go back to
      Boston probably to-morrow—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yes I 
      rec'd
      
       the wedding invitation cards from Mr [&amp;] Mrs Elverson for Alice<sup><a href="#nwu.00002_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; the happy (proposed)
      bride groom—I think him a lucky man—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well I must close at once, for here comes a fine lively team of white horses to take
      me out to ride, to be driven by the owner, Miss Mann,<sup><a href="#nwu.00002_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      herself—With love as always—
