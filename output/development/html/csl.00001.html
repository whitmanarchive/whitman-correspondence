      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Baldwin:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I write in reference to a friend of mine, Dr. Charles H. Bowen,<sup><a href="#csl.00001_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> of this city, who will soon call upon you personally. He
      seeks the appointment of Surgeon to the Metropolitan Police here. I have known Dr.
      Bowen for several years. He was a volunteer
      U.S. Army surgeon during the war, &amp; was considered one of the best. I can fully join
      in the same testimony, as he treated, as physician or surgeon, many a case under my
      own
      eye, for days &amp; even months. He is a good Union man, of full professional
      experience, gentlemanly manners, temperate, in the prime of life—&amp; I have more
      than once, when watching his treatment, called him an intuitive physician.
   </p>
   
   <p>I most strongly recommend him as the right man, &amp; one without deficiency in any of
      the qualifications needed for the place of Police Surgeon.
   </p>
   
   <p>Should you wish it, I will be glad to wait upon you, to testify further regarding
      Dr. B.
      I send you, dear sir, my friendliest respects &amp; well wishes,
   </p>
