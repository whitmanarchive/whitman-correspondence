      programme of Donnelly's<sup><a href="#loc.02267_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> "Cipher" Book—curious to
      look over.
   </p>
   
   <p>—Also your Sunday <u>Tribune</u> wh' I pilfered last
      night—also a couple of <u>Critics</u>—enjoyed a happy
      three hours last night &amp; am all the better for it to-day—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel, was Horace Traubel's
      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.02267_n1">1. The year of 1887 appears
      to be a plausible date since November 7 fell on Monday in that year.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.02267_n2">2. Ignatius Loyola Donnelly
      (1831–1901) was a politician and writer, well known for his notions of
      Atlantis as an antediluvian civilization and for his belief that Shakespeare's
      plays had been written by Francis Bacon, an idea he argued in his book <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in Shakespeare's
         Plays</em>, published in 1888. The "programme" referred to here was probably
      an announcement of the publication of that book.<a href="#r2">[back]
