   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00088_n5">1. Whitman crossed this letter
      out and on the back of it wrote one part of a series of notes that would become
      the essay "A Word About Tennyson."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00088_n1">2. See Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00088_n2">3. The second annual St.
      Louis Exposition opened on September 9, 1885, in a downtown block called
      Missouri Park. It featured music, amusements, art galleries, and commercial
      displays, and attracted 750,000 people.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00088_n3">4. "Walt Whitman writes to
      his London friends as follows: 'Fortunately, I have a good, faithful young
      Jersey woman and friend, Mary Davis, who cooks for me and vigilantly sees to
      me'" (<em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em>, September 10, 1885). This
      item is quoted from a letter of Whitman's to Herbert Gilchrist of .<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="yal.00088_n4">5. See Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman of .
      &nbsp;Tarr was now a journalist. &nbsp;He and Jeff evidently maintained a close
      association during Jeff's last four or five years of life (see the letter from
      Tarr to Walt Whitman of ). &nbsp;For
      Lane, see Thomas Jefferson Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman of .<a href="#r5">[back]
