      This postcard bears the address, "Pete Doyle, | M street South, bet 4½ &amp;
      6th | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Apr | 23 (?)| (?)."<br><br>
      The correspondence (again chiefly postcards) with Doyle in April and May was
      sent on Fridays, according to Whitman's habit. At this time Doyle was
      working out of Baltimore; note Whitman's , and  letters to
      Doyle. This postcard can be positively dated on the basis of Burroughs'
      visit; see his letter to Dowden on May 4, 1875, quoted by Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston:
      Houghton Mifflin, 1931), 94.<a href="#r1">[back]
