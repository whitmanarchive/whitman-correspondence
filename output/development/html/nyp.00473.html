      <br></br><br></br>Dear Harry
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter came all right, &amp; glad to hear from you, as always. There is nothing
      very new with me—I keep on about the same in most every respect—To-day,
      (Tuesday) as I write it is warm &amp; bright, &amp; I am going out to enjoy
      it—pretty much the same old round—over the ferry &amp; up Market street,
      
      Phila, &amp; stop occasionally at 23 south 9th st. where my books are 
      pub'd. Now
      that my two books, prose and the poems, are out, I hardly know what to strike
      for—what to look forward to, as I used to—The 
      Vols.
      
       are selling middling
      well—"Specimen Days" has been republished in
      Scotland<sup><a href="#nyp.00473_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; L. of G. is being translated in
      Germany<sup><a href="#nyp.00473_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p><em>Tuesday night 10½—</em>I am finishing my letter, as I
      have been out &amp; only got back late—This will be a dry letter—but you
      must take the will for the deed—I send you a package of papers &amp;c. once in
      a while, which I suppose you get—I came over to-night through the thick ice,
      filling the river—one big cake, half an acre, or more, hard &amp; thick, I
      thought would conquer us, but it didnt, we <em>
         crunch'd
         
         </em> our way
      
      thro'—but it was a high old <em>crunch</em> &amp; fight for ten
      minutes—&amp; I 
      enjoy'd
      
       it I tell you—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just been looking for your last letter to see if there is any special thing
      I
      ought to answer—but I cant find the letter—Never mind, Harry,
      dear—we'll make it all right when we meet—I have just written to your
      mother—Well my space is out, &amp; there goes the clock striking 11—Good
      night, dear son—&amp; here's a buss for you—
