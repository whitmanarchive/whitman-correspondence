      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just written to Mother<sup><a href="#duk.00341_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> and although it is pretty late I will write you a word to let you know that I am
      flourishing as well as ever. Walt you see I aint got my furlough yet. We had no more than landed here, before Dix<sup><a href="#duk.00341_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> (who commands this Department you know) issued an order that no furloughs would be
      alowed except in case of sickness or in a case of life and death or something of that sort,
      so I dont know but they will jew me out of my chance after all. Gen Smith<sup><a href="#duk.00341_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> who is in command of our Army Corps, said the other day he would see Dix and try
      and get permission to give furloughs to our Corps, himself, &nbsp;if he succeeds I will
      probaly get a chance to go anyhow I am going to make a big push for it.
   </p>
   
   <p>I got a letter from you last night dated I think the 22d &nbsp;write often Walt and let
      us know how things are with you. I went down to Fortress Monroe yesterday and got
      the $20 Jeff sent me.
   </p>
   
   <p>If I dont get a chance to go home soon I shall have to get measured here, and send on to you,
      or Jeff, to get me a suit of clothes made but I rather think I will get home before
      a great while.
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt we have a splendid camp here. I have a bran new tent and when I get it fixed
      up to suit me, it will just be gay I tell you. If I find out for certain, that I cant
      get home very soon you must come down here and see a feller, and if I do go home you
      must come as soon as I get back, &nbsp;I shall have my tent fixed up Bully in a day or two, &nbsp;we have
      had a grand revieu to day by Gen Dix &nbsp;the whole Army Corps was out, and as there is splendid grounds
      here for that kind of work we made a first rate appearance and everything went off
      with great applause &amp;c
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt I am getting sleepy as it is almost 12 Oclock &nbsp;so good night</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Washington Whitman (1829â€“1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
