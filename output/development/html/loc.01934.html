      <br></br><br></br>Mr. Walt Whitman,
      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is very mortifying to me not to be in a position to send you even a small portion
      of the balance 
      your
      
       due. We are in a much better locality for retail trade, and we hope to
      stir up a better mail trade by a new list which we shall send out soon. But we
      cannot hope for anything very satisfactory, considering the unprecedented stagnation
      in all business circles, for several weeks. Assuming A.K.B. &amp; Co.'s liabilities
      at such a time as this has made it very awkward for me. I never was in debt before.
      The business would be unmixed pleasure to me were my capital larger, as I think I
      can serve humanity better by distributing good books than in any other way. The
      first 
      op- 
      portunity
      
       that can be made, something will be sent you. I regret the inability to
      promptly settle more as I have understood you have never been paid by others who
      kept your books for sale. There seems no reason to doubt a good business being done
      here in a few weeks—in the early fall. I hope your health is improving. Many
      persons ask us about you, and take a keen interest in your welfare. I regret that
      I
      am not so situated as to be able to extend you an invitation to visit New York, and offer you comfortable quarters here while you
      remain; but I do not "keep house," have no family; and I vibrate between New York and Brooklyn as to
      sleeping quarters, not having any fixed habitation. Some one is compiling a book for
      the use of "Liberals" at funerals, etc. I have called his attention to your poem on
      Death ("Dark mother," etc.), which I consider the finest ever written.
   </p>

      Yours sincerely
      <br></br>
      Chas.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles P. Somerby was one of the book dealers whom
      Walt Whitman termed "embezzlers." In 1875 Somerby assumed the liabilities of
      Butts &amp; Co.; see Whitman's ,
      letter to Asa K. Butts &amp; Company. This proved to be a matter of
      embarrassment to Somerby, who, in reply to a lost letter on March 16, 1875, was
      unable "to remit the amount you name at present." On , he wrote: "It is very mortifying to me not to be in a
      position to send you even a small portion of the balance your due." On , Somerby sent $10—his only cash
      payment: "Have made every exertion to raise the $200 you require, and find it
      utterly impossible to get it. . . . We had hoped that you would accept our offer
      to get out your new book, and thus more than discharge our indebtedness to you."
      On , Somerby reported that "I have
      been losing, instead of gaining." On ,
      he sent Walt Whitman a statement pertaining to the volumes mentioned in this
      letter. On , he included a complete
      financial statement: in eighteen months he had made only one cash payment, and
      owed Walt Whitman $215.17. The firm was still unable to make a payment on . In August 1877, Walt Whitman
      received a notice of bankruptcy dated August 8, 1877,
       from, in his
      own words, "assignee [Josiah Fletcher, an attorney] of the rascal Chas P.
      Somerby." These manuscripts are in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.
