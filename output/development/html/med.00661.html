      <br></br><br></br>Dear Harry
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of to-day with the 10 has safely 
      reach'd
      
       me. Why have you sent it? It is singular &amp; unnecessary—<u>you were entirely welcome, &amp; always have
         been</u><sup><a href="#med.00661_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I have been away most of the last five or six weeks at Germantown 9 or 10
      miles out[side] 
      Phila.
      
       on a visit to very kind Quaker folks, particular friends of mine<sup><a href="#med.00661_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—had a good time—good grub—a horse to
      my use to drive every day, (which I did, a long drive)—a large
      library—&amp;c. I am well as usual—nothing very new with my affairs (but
      the last six or eight months has kind of gone back on me)—I 
      rec'd
      
       a letter from Glendale<sup><a href="#med.00661_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> from your
      mother 
      ab't
      
       three weeks ago—I have written two letters to her—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I don't know whether this will reach you as I am not certain of the right address—Havn't
      
       seen Mont<sup><a href="#med.00661_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> for several weeks, but suppose he is
      here the same yet.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00661_n1">1. Whitman, to help out with
      expenses, paid the Staffords when he stayed at their farm, so it is possible
      that Harry decided to reciprocate on a recent occasion when he visited Whitman
      in Camden.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00661_n2">2. Whitman began in early 1883
      to make frequent visits to the home of Robert Pearsall Smith and Hannah Whitall
      Smith in Germantown; their daughter, Mary Whitall Smith, had admired Whitman's
      work during her studies at Smith College and talked her father into taking her
      to Camden to meet the poet. Whitman became good friends with this wealthy Quaker
      family and stayed with them from August 4–28 (a little over three weeks,
      not the "five or six weeks" he claims in the letter).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00661_n3">3. Glendale is near Kirkwood,
      New Jersey. At various times, Whitman and the Stafford family seem to refer to
      the contiguous communities of Kirkwood and Glendale interchangeably, as if
      Kirkwood were part of the larger community of Glendale.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00661_n4">4. Montgomery ("Mont")
      Stafford was Harry's younger brother.<a href="#r4">[back]
