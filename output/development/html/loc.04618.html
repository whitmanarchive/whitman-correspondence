      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mrs. Gilchrist of Hampstead showed me yesterday a new book of yours which I have not
      got. You had just sent it to her. I must have a copy. Will you kindly send me one
      and tell me what the price is, or if you prefer it, tell me what the price is first
      and let me have the book when you get the order for the money. I obtained the Two
      Rivulets from you direct, and therefore apply to you directly now.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have one additional favour to ask of you. It is twenty two
      
      years ago since I first bought the "Leaves of Grass" and before that time I had most
      earnestly proclaimed to all my friends, on the strength of what I had read of yours
      that here was a new fact and that America through you had found an interpreter to
      its hitherto unrecognised meaning. Everybody was sceptical and many sneered. Some
      however have been since converted.
   </p>
   
   <p>Therefore, may I beg of you to let me have in the copy which you are going to send
      to me <u>all</u> the portraits which are in the one Mrs. Gilchrist has and to write my name also in
      my copy. I make this request because
      
      Mrs. Gilchrist told me that the edition for the public is not quite like hers.
   </p>
   
   <p>I learn from her that your health is better and she showed me a card from you which
      to my great delight revealed the old satisfaction with the world and the old joy in
      the sunshine. I too have a long way turned the corner and hope that your peace and
      steadfast content may be mine to the endâ€”
   </p>

      Ever yours
