      <br></br><br></br>Dear Jack<sup xmlns=""><a href="#nyp.00402_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am down here for a few days—Came down last Saturday fore-noon—am with folks I love,
      &amp; that love me—have had a real good old-fashion'd time, first-rate for me—It is a
      farm, every thing plain &amp; plenty, &amp; blazing wood fires—in the eating line, lots of
      chickens, eggs, fresh pork &amp;c: (they kill a hog every two weeks)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You ought to be here with me a day or so—(likely one day would be enough <em>for you</em>, as there is no city excitement or fashions—no <em>sogering</em>—no balls or theatres—but quite lots of <em>gals</em>, &amp; some real nice ones)—I take an old man's liberty of <em>kissing them all</em>, (especially the handsome ones) when I go around where they are—as I have been coming
      down here off &amp; on for nearly two years &amp; have got acquainted—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I go out walking a good deal down a lane &amp; by a beautiful pond &amp; creek I am very fond
      of—spend two or three hours there first-rate, even this weather, all by myself—I am
      quite happy here for me—the weather was very fine for two days, but is a little cooler
      to-day—I can't walk far you know, but I go stumping about &amp; enjoy it—yesterday they took
      me out on a long ride—went through the piney woods, which I always like—Jack, I thought
      you might like to get a line from me, from here—Every thing is so different from Market
      st or Chestnut or Penn st—but there is no difference in your loving old friend &amp; comrade
   </p>

   <p id="nyp.00402_n1">2. According to Whitman's
      notation on Jack Johnston's calling card, the young man was employed about this
      time by A. R. McCown &amp; Co., a hosiery store in Philadelphia. Later he was
      employed by Ziegler &amp; Swearingen, sellers of notions in Philadelphia
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). In Jack's
      autograph book, Whitman wrote in 1875: "In memory of the good times, Sunday
      evenings, in Penn street, 1875, '4, &amp; '3." On January 18, 1880, he wrote
      again: "Good times, Sunday Evenings, continued, '76, '77, '78, '79, &amp;c. W W"
