      <br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of 26th rec'd. It looks like something beginning to be done. About Piper's<sup><a href="#yal.00399_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> bill you can wait till you go personally to Boston.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have written to O'Kane<sup><a href="#yal.00399_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> to–day, &amp; I hope you will
      have no further difficulty in getting the books—I have requested him to send word
      to
      you to come &amp; get them. If we get started in the way we talked of, (&amp; I have no
      doubt we shall,) &amp; satisfaction is felt on both sides, it is certainly my intention
      that
      you shall have actual &amp; complete control of the sales—&amp; all supplies.
   </p>

   <p id="yal.00399_n1">1. A New York bookseller at 39 Dey Street.
      Whitman was having difficulties—real or imaginary, as his mother might
      have said—with booksellers. When Whitman wrote this letter, he had decided
      to let Butts, as he said, "have actual &amp; complete control of the sales."
      Commenting on one of the letters of Butts, Whitman observed to Horace Traubel in
      1889: "What a sweat I used to be in all the time . . . over getting my damned
      books published! When I look back at it I wonder I didn't somewhere or other on
      the road chuck the whole business into oblivion" (<em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1996], <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.79.html">3:561</a>). Butts went bankrupt in 1874.<a href="#r1">[back]

      also Whitman's  letter to W. H.
      Piper &amp; Co. Evidently Piper settled the bill in February; see Whitman's  letter to Peter Doyle, in which
      he noted the receipt of "a check paying a debt due me a long time, &amp; which I
      had quite given up."<a href="#r2">[back]
