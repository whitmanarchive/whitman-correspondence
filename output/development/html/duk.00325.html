      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We arived here about 4 Oclock this morning after marching 12 or 14 miles during the
      night and are pretty well tired out I tell you. I sent you a few lines day before
      yesterday to let you know that I was safe and sound, but as I have heard that no letters
      have been sent from here since the fight, I dont know if you received them. We left Fredericksburg Sep 12th<sup><a href="#duk.00325_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and have marched almost every day and often all night since and as we have had no
      tents, of course we have had to sleep out in the woods and fields rain or shine &nbsp;When
      we left Fredericksburg we marched 30 or 35 miles to Culpepper &nbsp;from there we went
      to Cedar Mountains &nbsp;from there to Kellys Ford on the Rappahannock river to keep Jackson
      from crossing, from there we went to Warrenton &nbsp;from there to Warrenton Junction and
      then to Mannassas Junction where we arived a few hours after Jackson<sup><a href="#duk.00325_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> had destroyed a large train of cars and buildings at the Depot, &nbsp;from there we started
      for the old Bull Run battle feild where we arived on the morning of Friday, August 29th and found the fight going on, our side haveing altogather the best of it. After resting a short time the first Brigade of our Division (which is
      Reno's Division)<sup><a href="#duk.00325_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> were ordered into a peice of woods where the enemy were strongly posted and our Brigade which is the 2d was
      ordered to support a Battery of light Artillery which was posted on a hill, &nbsp;we threw
      off our knapsacks and formed line of battle in a ravine in the rear of the Battery
      &nbsp;but as the enemy did not see fit to attempt to take the Battery we had nothing to
      do but lay off as we were protected from the enemys fire by the hills in front of us. In the meantime our first Brigade had been driven
      out of the woods with heavy loss and had fell back to where we were posted, &nbsp;just
      before night we were ordered into the woods but just as we were about going in we
      saw the enemy make a very desparate charge on a Battery on our left where the 14th of Brooklyn<sup><a href="#duk.00325_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> and the other regiments were posted and we were ordered to halt and here we stacked
      arms and stoped for the night &nbsp;during the night a volley of about 20 shots were fired into us and
      some of the balls passed mighty close to my head as I lay in the grass &nbsp;we jumped up and seized our rifles
      but as the fireing ceased we lay down again and slept till morning when we were ordered bact to the Battery where we stayed untill about 5 Oclock in the afternoon when as the enemy had broken through our left (were
      McDowell<sup><a href="#duk.00325_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> troops were posted) and were trying to flank us and cut off our Artillary and baggage
      train &nbsp;our Division was ordered to hold them in check untill the trains could get out of the way &nbsp;We went in on a double quick and with a yell
      and our Brigade being left in front and our Company being on the left we ran slapp into the rebels before we knew where we were (as it was getting quite dark) was so
      close to them that &nbsp;I could hear them talk very plain and some of the rebels sung
      out to us not to fire as they were our own men and as soon as we came up as close
      as they wanted us to they poured a volley into us and before we could form in line
      of battle they gave us one or two more. Our men broke a little at the first volley
      but we soon rallied them and then began about as sharp a fight as I ever wish to see. As soon as the action
      commenced I took a rifle from one of our men who had been shot and I took 8 or 10
      cartridges from some of the wounded and had a few shots on my own hook which seemed
      to encourage the men very much &nbsp;we soon drove the rebels but they rallied and came
      on again but we were ready for them this time and they gave way again and fell back
      &nbsp;we stayed there and waited for them till about 9 Oclock but they had enough and did
      not make another attempt and as the trains and all passed on towards Centreville our
      Regt left the field marching company front &nbsp;we being the last Regt engaged in the
      terrible fight of Saturday and the last to leave the feild &nbsp;we fell back as far as Centreville where we lay Sunday and sunday night and on Monday
      the enemy made another attemt to cut off our baggage train as it was falling back from Centreville to Alexandria
      &nbsp;our Brigade with Stephens and Kearnys<sup><a href="#duk.00325_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> brigades were ordered to move down and engage them and our Regt was ordered into
      a Cyprus swamp on the extreme right where the trees were so thik we could hardly walk and the rain was falling in torrents completely soaking us.
      &nbsp;we only found a few of the enemys skirmishers who we drove out but the Regiments who went in on the left of us &nbsp;among
      which was the Mass 21st belonging to our Brigade and who have stood side by side with
      us in all the fights we ever had was completely cut to peices &nbsp;our regiment has lost in killed and wounded and missing 92 or men of which our company
      lost 15

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00325_n100">1. In this letter Whitman
      describes his experiences in the Second Battle of Manassas (August 29, 1862 to
      August 30, 1862), also called Second Bull Run, and the Battle of Chantilly
      (September 1, 1862). &nbsp;Both engagements were decisive victories for the
      Confederates.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00325_n2">2. August 12, 1862; see
      George Washington Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman from .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00325_n3">3. See George Washington
      Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman from .<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00325_n4">4. Jesse Lee Reno
      (1823–1862) then commanded the second brigade, in which Whitman's regiment
      was fighting.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00325_n5">5. See George Washington
      Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00325_n6">6. Irvin McDowell
      (1818–1885) commanded the Third Army Corps in the Army of the
      Potomac.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="duk.00325_n7">7. Isaac Ingalls Stevens
      (1818–1862) and Philip Kearny (1815-1862). &nbsp;Whitman is now speaking of the
      Battle of Chantilly; the fact that both these generals died here (see George
      Washington Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman from ) attests to the severity of the combat—which Whitman endeavored to
      deemphasize in the reports to his mother.<a href="#r7">[back]
