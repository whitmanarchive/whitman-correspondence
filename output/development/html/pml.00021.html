      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Although your letter I see has the N. Y. post office stamp, Mar. 25, I have only just
      rec'd it, (2 o'clock Wednesday P.M.)—I have talked with Thomas Harlan<sup><a href="#pml.00021_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>—he treated me very
      well. My impression is, there is little or no chance of getting Congress to pass,
      at
      this time, a special resolution or law putting the ruffles on the list of
      exempts—There is no Committee of Ways &amp; Means yet appointed in the H[ouse]
      of R[epresentatives]—True, any member could offer such a Bill, &amp; if it had
      powerful influence, they <em>might</em> suspend the rules &amp; pass
      it—but there are too many, both in House &amp; Senate, who would almost
      certainly object—one objection would be that ruffles are matters of extra
      ornament &amp;c. &amp;c. and ought to pay a tax, if any thing does<sup><a href="#pml.00021_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Still, I will try what I can do—I will see a few of the members,
      forthwith—I have one in my mind, I think may be the best one I can get to
      offer a Bill, &amp; if he is willing, we will try it on—Had I known it when
      the Committee &amp; House were cooking the Bill, I have no doubt I could have got it
      put in with the ¶ including shirt-bosoms, &amp;c.—But that's poor
      consolation.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing new or important with me. I am well as usual, &amp; working the
      same, (not much.) Love to Helen and Emmy &amp; all.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pml.00021_n1">1. This letter's envelope
      bears the address, "Abby H. Price, | 279 East 55th street, | New York City." It
      is postmarked: "Washington | (?) | (?) | D.C."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00021_n3">2. Undoubtedly Thomas
      Harland, chief clerk in the Patent Office, to whom Abby Price referred in her
      letter of .<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="pml.00021_n4">3. Walt Whitman was replying
      to Abby Price's letter of , in which
      she made a tempting offer: "I write now in great haste to ask your assistance in
      behalf of Our Ruffle Manufacture and if you succeed in doing what we ask, or in
      getting it done I am authorized to offer you a 1000 dollar check as soon as it
      is done! think of that. Tis only a simple act of Justice that we ask either." As
      a dressmaker, Price feared the effect on her business of a projected tax on
      ruffles; see Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> (New
      York: Macmillan, 1955), 381.<a href="#r3">[back]
