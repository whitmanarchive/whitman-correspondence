      <br></br><br></br>Dearest friend,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n0259" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To your good &amp; comforting letter of Feb. 25th<sup><a href="#upa.00018_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> I at once
      answer, at least with a few lines. I have already to–day written (answering one just rec'd from him) a pretty long letter to Mr Rossetti<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r3">3</a></sup>, &amp; requested him to loan it to
      you for perusal. In that I have described my situation fully &amp; candidly.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My new edition is printed &amp; ready. On receipt of your letter I have mailed you a set,
      two vols., which you ought to have rec'd by this time. I wish you to send me word soon as they arrive.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My health I am encouraged to think is perhaps a shade better—certainly as well as
      any
      time of late. I even already vaguely contemplate plans, (they may never be fulfilled,
      but
      yet again they may,) of changes, journeys—even of coming to London, of seeing you,
      of
      visiting my friends, &amp;c. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My dearest friend, I do not approve your American trans–settlement<sup><a href="#upa.00018_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I see so many things here, you have yet no idea of—the
      American social &amp; almost every other kind of crudeness, meagreness, (at least in
      appearance)—Don't do any thing toward such a move, nor resolve on it, nor indeed make
      any move at all in it, without further advice from me. If I should get well enough
      to
      voyage, we will talk about it yet in London—You must not be uneasy about me—dear
      friend, I get along much better than you suppose. As to my literary situation here,
      my
      rejection by the coteries—&amp; my poverty, (which is the least of my
      troubles)—I am not sure but I enjoy them all. Besides, as to the latter, I am not
      in
      want. Best love to you, &amp; to your children.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0259">1. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00018_n1">2. Gilchrist continued to ignore the obvious:
      Walt Whitman wanted her (and her passion) three thousand miles away. On , she informed him that she was
      sailing for America on August 30, 1876. On , she was ecstatic: "Soon, very soon I come, my darling. . . .
      this is the last spring we shall be assunder—O I passionately believe
      there are years in store for us— . . . Hold out but a little longer for
      me, my Walt." Gilchrist wrote again, on , after she had seen some of Whitman's poems in the London <em>Daily News</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">3. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00018_n2">4. In her reply on , Gilchrist refused Walt Whitman's advice: "I can't
      exactly obey that, for it has been my settled steady purpose (resting on a deep
      strong faith) ever since 1869." After reading <em>Two
         Rivulets</em>, she could not curb her ardor, writing on : "sweetest deepest greatest
      experience of my life—what I was made for, surely I was made as the soil
      in which the precious seed of your thoughts &amp; emotions should be
      planted—they to fulfil themselves in me, that I might by &amp; bye blossom
      into beauty &amp; bring forth rich fruits—immortal fruits." Gilchrist sent
      birthday greetings on .<a href="#r4">[back]
