      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman:       
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We are back only a few days from Delaware C., where we had a good time, tho' the winter
      was very severe &amp; I was storm bound in the house 4 days.<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r1">1</a></sup> I spent all the good days upon the hills &amp; mountains hunting [
      <span class="unclear">foxes?</span>]
       or else upon the ice hooking up suckers; &amp; now I am paying the penalty of the exposure
      to the severe
      
      
      cold in another attack of neuralgia in my arm &amp; shoulder: it is very severe night
      &amp; day. Wife<sup><a href="#n0892" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; baby are pretty well; the baby is a great help, though he makes lots of work &amp;
      trouble. Smith &amp; family are well; he is working on the ice. He was pleased with his
      gloves.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just sent off my MS. to Briton. At first the publisher liked the title "Locusts
      &amp; Wild Honey"<sup><a href="#n3016" id="r3">3</a></sup> but now they write me they dont like it—think it will mystify people &amp;c.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Tell me what you think. I send you a list of the subjects. They have nearly all been
      in print in the magazines, but I have been overhauling them very severely this fall.
      If I can devise a better title I shall do so, but I think my readers will understand
      this one; the great public does not care for my books anyhow.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When are you coming to N.Y?</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0129">1. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0892">2. Ursula North Burroughs
      (1836–1917) was John Burroughs's wife. Ursula and John were married on
      September 12, 1857. The couple maintained a small farm overlooking the Hudson
      River in West Park, Ulster County. They adopted a son, Julian, at two months of
      age. It was only later revealed that John himself was the biological father of
      Julian.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3016">3. Burroughs published <em>Locusts and Wild Honey</em>, a collection of allegorical
      nature writing, in 1879. The volume contains a meditation on water that praises
      Whitman's expression "the slumbering and liquid trees" from "Song of Myself."
      See John Burroughs, <em>Locusts and Wild Honey</em> (1879; Boston:
      Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1895), 71.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01132_n1">4. The published book contains
      the same chapter titles, except that "Sharp Eyes" precedes "Strawberries"
      instead of coming after it. See Burroughs, <em>Locusts and Wild
         Honey</em>.<a href="#r4">[back]
