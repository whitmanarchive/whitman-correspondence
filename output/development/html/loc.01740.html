   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01740_n1">1. Whitman evidently
      returned to Washington on June 2, as planned. Unwell and depressed, he finally
      went to the home of the Ashtons, where he at least did not have to climb to the
      fourth floor. About June 16 he returned to Camden.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01740_n2">2. At this point in the letter,
      Richard Maurice Bucke, one of Whitman's literary executors, wrote handwritten
      comments directly on Whitman's letter (later crossed out by a diagonal line):
      "He had left Washington some two weeks before this letter was written. Had been
      lying sick in that city, paralyzed, and 'Pete' had been in with him often, to
      wait on and assist him. His mother &amp; brother George lived in Camden, he went
      there for a chance expedition to return to Washington. On Monday 23 June his
      mother died suddenly. It was a terrible shock and grief to him but it seems his
      physical state was not affected by it for the first week. On Saturday 31<u>st</u> he still expects to
      return to Washington almost at once. His letter of 9<u>th</u> June (wrongly dated 7<u>th</u>) shows that almost
      immediately after May 31—probably 1<u>st</u> or 2<u>d</u> June—he became so much worse that all
      thought of immediate return to 
      W.
      
       had to be abandoned. He must have written 'Pete' at least once between
      31 May and 9 June. Letter or letters lost."<a href="#r2">[back]
