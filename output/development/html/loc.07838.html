   <p>Best remembrance &amp; love to all—I am getting along better than you w'd
      suppose (have this tenacious grip though)—was out last Sunday—was
      propell'd in the wheel chair—to my Camden friends Mr. and Mrs. T B Harned<sup><a href="#n4146" id="r1">1</a></sup> who treated me to a splendid meal of oysters &amp;
      champagne—to wh' <em>abstemious me</em> did fullest justice (I
      think the best ch: I ever drank)—I am writing a little annex (the 2d) to L of
      G.<sup><a href="#loc.07838_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; giving out the design of my burial vault
      (on a little wooded slope in Harleigh Cemetary here)—

      the Lord bless you all—

   <p>Give this to Alma<sup><a href="#n3029" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; the girls—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
