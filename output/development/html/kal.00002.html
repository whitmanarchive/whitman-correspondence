      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wrote a letter to the Tribune the other day touching you &amp; your matters &amp;
      if they publish it I wish you would send me the paper as I do not see the daily
      except I am away from home. I saw their editorial of Tuesday &amp; was much
      incensed by it. I presume it is Bayard Taylor's hand.<sup><a href="#n1063" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I am on the sick list now from quinsy soar throat &amp; am very distressed. I wish you would
      drop me a line. I wrote to you a week or two ago.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1063">1. Although the New York <em>Tribune</em> had printed Whitman's review of his own books
      earlier in the year (see Whitman's  letter to Whitelaw Reid) as well as sympathetic reports on
      January 29 and February 25, 1876, and excerpts from <em>Two
         Rivulets</em> on March 1, 1876, the newspaper, probably through the
      influence of Bayard Taylor, began to publish hostile notices. Burroughs' defense
      was published on April 13, 1876. On April 22, 1876, William D. O'Connor,
      Whitman's estranged friend, wrote an extravagant, and garrulous, encomium. Later
      the <em>Tribune</em> resumed its friendly attitude toward
      Whitman.<a href="#r1">[back]
