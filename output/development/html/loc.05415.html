      <br></br>Camden,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Thursday
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter was received this morning, I was glad that you arrived safely in Washington.
      After I left you on Monday, I went to see the young lady, that I spoke to you of,
      that
      had been to Atlantic City, and I asked her, what kind of a place it was to have a
      quiet,
      nice time, and she said very good, that the 
      Doctors
      
       house was the nearest the ocean, and that there would be a good walk to the
      beach from the house this year, and there is always a good 
      breeze, and she said that if you had a room  fronting the ocean it was splendid. They
      go down the middle of June.
   </p>
   
   <p>I rather think you would like it. As for coming to Camden, come right away if you
      can,
      plenty of room you know, and no doubt we will get enough to eat Aunt Libbie went away
      this morning. I had a letter from Mary 
      to day, she wanted to know more about Mamy's death, I am going to write very soon to both
      Hannah and her, I have not found
      time yet to write all that I want to say, that is a satisfactory letter to them.
   </p>
   
   <p>We had a line from Jeff</p>
   
   <p>George is well and busy</p>
   
   <p>Hope this will find you
      
      
      feeling better. You might just send a line when you will be here. Love from all
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
