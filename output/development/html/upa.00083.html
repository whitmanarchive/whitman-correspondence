   <p id="upa.00083_n1">1. This postal card is
      addressed: Herbert H Gilchrist | 12 Well Road | Hampstead | London England. It
      is postmarked: CAMDEN | SEP | 14 | 4 30 PM | 1886 | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="upa.00083_n2">2. Sir Edward Thornton
      (1817–1906) was the English envoy at Washington from 1867 to 1881.
      According to the anecdote, Sir Edward, upon observing an intoxicated lady
      surrounded by jeering people in the streets of Washington, descended from his
      carriage and escorted her home (Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist, <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em> [1887], 233).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

      the editor of the first British edition of Whitman's work and brother of the
      poets Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti. For more, see Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael [1829–1915]</a>," <em>Walt
