      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>By this mail I am sending you the Christmas number of the <u>Review
         of Reviews</u> in which, at pages 581 + 592 you will find your beautiful poem
      "To the Sunset breeze" + your article "Old Poets" [illegible]—the no. is an unusually varied + interesting
      one.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have forwarded copies of my "Notes" with short letters to all the friends whose
      names you gave me This morning I rec<u>d</u> a letter of
      acknowledgement from R Pearsall Smith<sup><a href="#n4979" id="r1">1</a></sup> (London) in which he
      speaks of you as "the statuesque old man" + as "one of the landmarks of literary
      history."
   </p>
   
   <p>Since [
      <span class="unclear">necessary?</span>]
      
      [illegible] letter I have been much troubled about
      you + am very [
      <span class="unclear">anxious?</span>]
      
      to learn how you are keeping. Better I hope. I sent a brief p.c. to Warry<sup><a href="#loc.00668_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> which I hope he will reply to immediately; + if it w<u>d</u> not be troubling him too much, I sh<u>d</u> be greatly obliged if he w<u>d</u> kindly drop me a
      line or two if only on a p.c., say once a week, while your illness continues.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>When I think of you, my dear old friend, prostrated by bodily illness, suffering
      physical pain +, for the most part, <u>alone</u> my heart yearns
      to ward you + I long to be able to do something to help you. But alas! I can do
      nothing but write + assure you of my tender sympathy + of my heartfelt + daily
      deepening affection for you. God [illegible] now + always give you immunity from pain! [illegible] constant prayer one who owe more
      to you than to any other man living or dead + who will ever hold you in the highest
      reverence + love.
   </p>
   
   <p>This has been a disagreeable day here— the ground is thicker covered with snow,
      the wind is [illegible] + cutting, there is
      a keen frost + the whole town + neighbourhood are enveloped in a thick fog. [illegible] I had [illegible] driving in my open conveyance I c<u>d</u> not take my brougham—+ the all-prevalent moisture condensed on my
      beard + moustache + froze into tiny icicles which had to be thawed off. It was about
      as unpleasant an experience as I ever remember but now that I have seen the last of
      the patients in the surgery + had a bit of dinner I am feeling warm + comfortable
      again + am writing this letter to you on my literary machine (the boy's present[illegible] before a nice warm fire in an open
      fireplace + with my dear wife reading beside me.
   </p>
   
   <p>I read a letter from Mr Wallace<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r3">3</a></sup> in which he tells me that he has
      today written a letter to you + that he has previously sent you copies of the songs
      W. dixon wrote for my birthday party.
   </p>
   
   <p>And now I must bring this badly written letter to a close by wishing [illegible] compliments of the festive seasons
      + a speedy return to health [illegible]
      health as may be expected at your time of life + under your circumstances.
   </p>
   
   <p>With my kindest regards to all the members of your household + with my best
      heart's-love to you
   </p>

   </p>
   
   
   <p>P.S. JWW's birthday gift to me was a beautifully [illegible] up book—"Familiar Wild birds." The presentation
      was made by J. W. Wallace in a graceful and appropriate speech in which he spoke
      of some of the qualities of mind and heart wich have endeared Mr Hutton to us
      all and which he (J.W.W.) has referred to in one of his letters to you. He spoke
      of him as a man who instead of shirking the "spectres of the mind" as so many
      clergymen do has boldly faced + slain them + has emerged from the conflict
      strengthened + with a purer + loftier faith. He is an altogether splendid fellow
      + although he belongs to a class with whom we have not much sympathy we can talk
      to him quite freely
      + unconstrainedly on any subject, conscious that in him we shall find true
      sympathy, comfort + help. He is by far the best "parson" I have ever known + his
      manly outspokeness his transparent sincerity, his broad-minded charity, his
      tender sympathy, his kind-heartedness, his high-mindedness and his deep +
      sincere love for his fellows have won for him the esteem + affection of troops
      of friends; + I think that the mere fact of his being such an honoured + trusted
      member of our little circle of friends composed as it is of such heterogenous
      elements speaks volumes of praise for this "Prince among parsons." He has a genuine
      regard for you + frequently quotes from L. of G. in his sermons at the Parish
      Church.
   </p>
   
   <p>In his reply to the presentation speeches he said that when he first saw J. W.
      W.'s pocket book copy he felt envious. A more acceptable present could not have
      been selected +, opening the book + turning over its leaves he said "this book
      seems to bring him (i.e. <u>you</u>) very near to me + there
      seems to be an air of himself about it." It was because we knew that you were
      with us in spirit + because the book had come straight from your hands that we
      ventured to put
      "from Walt Whitman" upon it.
   </p>
   
   <p>After the presentation I read aloud your kind letter to me also "Warry's" + Dr.
      Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> + conveyed to them your "loving salutation" to
      them all which they received with acclamation.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your portrait was hanging in the room. So you see that you were really "one of
      us" + we feel sure that you were "one with us" too.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4979">1. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.00668_n4">2. Frederick Warren Fritzinger
      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,
      535).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6121">3. James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire

   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
