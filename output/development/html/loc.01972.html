   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3121">1. Jesse Whitman (1818–1870) had
      suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence for several years
      before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in December 1864.
      Shortly after an outburst that followed his brother Andrew Jackson Whitman's
      death in December 1863—he threatened Martha Mitchell and Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in some hospital or
      place where he would be doctored" (see Jeff's  to Walt Whitman). Louisa resisted institutionalizing Jesse
      because, according to her 
      letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put him there." On December 5,
      1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic Asylum on Flatbush Avenue.
