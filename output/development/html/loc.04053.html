      <br></br><br></br>My Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> has told you of our difficulties in getting comfortable quarters here—and also that
      we seem now to have succeeded—not indeed in the way I most wished &amp; hoped we had—in
      19th St., taking rooms &amp; boarding ourselves—so that we could have a friend with us
      when &amp; as we pleased. It seems as if that were not practicable unless we were to furnish
      for ourselves. Certainly our experiences there of using another's kitchen were discouraging—it
      was so dirty and uncomfortable that we were glad to take refuge in a regular boarding
      house again before one week was out. It seems to me more difficult to get anything
      of a medium kind in New York than elsewhere I have been—if it isn't the best, it is
      very uninviting indeed. Herby is enjoying his work and companionship at the League
      very much. We stand the cold well—how does it suit you? Is your arm free from rheumatic
      pains? When you come to Mr. J. H. Johnstons,<sup><a href="#n0336" id="r3">3</a></sup> which will be very soon I hope, we shall be quite handy, and have a pretty, sunny
      room—a sitting room by day!—with a handsome piece of furniture which is metamorphosed
      into a bed at night—and a large dressing closet with hot &amp; cold water adjoining—all
      very comfortable. O how wistfully do I think of one evening in Philadelphia, last
      winter. I shan't begin really to like New York till you come and we have had some
      chats together. I have news from England which makes me rather anxious. The Blaenavon
      Co., to which Per.<sup><a href="#n2000" id="r4">4</a></sup> is chemist, has gone into liquidation—&amp; I don't know whether it will continue to
      exist—or how soon in these dull times he may find a good opening elsewhere. Should
      things go badly for him, either Giddy<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r5">5</a></sup> and I will return to England to share [our] home with him there, or else I want him
      to take into serious consideration coming out here, instead of our going back. Of
      course it would be a risky thing for him to do with wife<sup><a href="#n3006" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; child, in these times, unless some definite opening presented itself, but I cannot
      help thinking that, being an expert in his profession, with first rate training &amp;
      experience, and iron work &amp; metallurgy promising here to have such enormous developments,
      he would be sure to do well in the end; and meanwhile we could rub on together somehow.
      However, we shall see. I have laid the matter before him, he &amp; his dear little wife
      wrote me a very brave, cheery letter when they told me the bad news—&amp; I shall have
      an answer to mine, I suppose, by the end of the month. Kate Hillard<sup><a href="#n0302" id="r7">7</a></sup> read an amusing paper on Swinburne<sup><a href="#n0610" id="r8">8</a></sup> at a meeting of the Woman's Club in Brooklyn—&amp; we had some fine music too. For the
      rest, I have not yet presented any introductions here.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Have had some beautiful glimpses of the North &amp; East River effects of the shipping
      at sunset, &amp;c.—Have subscribed to the Mercantile library,—&amp; are beginning to feel
      at home. Herby &amp; Giddy had been to hear Mr. Frothingham<sup><a href="#n1504" id="r9">9</a></sup> this morning, &amp; were much interested. Bee<sup><a href="#n0260" id="r10">10</a></sup> missed us sorely at first—but writes—when she does write, which is but seldom—pretty
      cheerily. Friendly remembrance to your brother &amp; sister. I wonder where Hattie<sup><a href="#n0911" id="r11">11</a></sup> &amp; Jessie<sup><a href="#duk.00343_n2" id="r12">12</a></sup> are spending their holidays. Love from us all. Good-bye, dear friend.
   </p>

      <br></br>A. Gilchrist.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Had a letter from Mr. Marvin<sup><a href="#n0830" id="r13">13</a></sup>—all well—he is doing the Washington letter of a N. Eng. paper. Hopes &amp; trusts you
      are really going to Washington.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0259">1. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0262">2. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0336">3. John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n2000">4. Percy Carlyle Gilchrist
      (1851–1935) was a British chemist and metallurgist, and the son of
      Alexander and Anne Gilchrist. Along with his cousin, Sidney Gilchrist Thomas, he
      developed the Thomas-Gilchrist process of producing steel from phosphoric pig
      iron during the late 1870s. See Marion Walker Alcaro, <em>Walt
         Whitman's Mrs. G: A Biography of Anne Gilchrist</em> (Cranbury, N.J.:
      Associated University Presses, 1991), 252 n28.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n0890">5. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3006">6. Norah Gilchrist, née
      Fitzmaurice, was the wife of Anne Gilchrist's son Percy Carlyle
      Gilchrist.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0302">7. Katharine Hillard (1839?–1915) was the translator of
      Dante's <em>Banquet</em> (1889) and the editor of <em>An Abridgment by Katharine Hillard of the Secret Doctrine: A
         Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy by Helena Petrovna
         Blavatsky</em> (1907). A Brooklyn resident, she was a friend of Abby Price
      (see Whitman's , letter to
      Price); in fact, according to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter to Helen Price
      on November 26, 1872, the Prices expected that Arthur Price and Katharine
      Hillard would marry (Pierpont Morgan Library). Whitman had known Hillard's
      writings since 1871 and mentioned her in his , letter to Charles Eldridge. He sent her a copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> on July 27, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book). Writing to Whitman on ,
      Moncure D. Conway quoted from a letter sent to him by Katharine Hillard: "I have
      made a discovery since I have been here [in the Adirondacks], and that is, that
      I never half appreciated Walt Whitman's poetry till now, much as I fancied I
      enjoyed it. To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the only
      one who can reach and level their lift, to use his own words, to pass and
      continue beyond" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell
      Kennerley, 1914], 3:112). The first meeting of the poetess with Whitman took
      place on February 28, 1876.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0610">8. Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) was a
      British poet, critic, playwright, and novelist. He was also one of Whitman's
      earliest English admirers. At the conclusion of <em>William Blake:
         A Critical Essay</em> (1868), 300–303, Swinburne pointed out
      similarities between Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly
      Rocking" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the
      most sweet and sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world." His
      famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America" is included in <em>Songs
         before Sunrise</em> (1871). For the story of Swinburne's veneration of
      Whitman and his later recantation, see two essays by Terry L. Meyers, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00740.pdf">Swinburne and Whitman: Further Evidence</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 14 (Summer 1996), 1–11 and "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00902.pdf">A

   <p id="n1504">9. Octavius Brooks Frothingham
      (1822–1895) was an American Transcendentalist author and public speaker,
      and was apparently familiar with <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. On July
      3rd, 1891, Whitman told Horace Traubel, "I have understood O. B. was always my
      friend—that his allusions were always kind—that he quoted 'Leaves of
      Grass' without doubt, fear" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, [Oregon House, CA: W.L. Bentley, 1996], 8:355).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0260">10. Beatrice Carwardine Gilchrist (1854–1881) was
      the second child (and first daughter) of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist. An
      aspiring physician, Beatrice took the needed preparatory classes but was barred
      (as were all women) from becoming a medical student in England. As a result, she
      attended the Women's Medical College in Philadelphia. She held positions as a
      physician in Berne, Switzerland, and later Edinburgh before committing suicide
      by fatally ingesting hydrocyanic acid in 1881.<a href="#r10">[back]

   <p id="n0911">11. Mannahatta Whitman was the first
      daughter of Walt Whitman's brother, Jeff Whitman, and his wife Martha Mitchell
      Whitman.<a href="#r11">[back]

   <p id="duk.00343_n2">12. Jessie Louisa Whitman,

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0830">13. Joseph B. Marvin, a friend and
      an admirer of Whitman's poetry, was from 1866 to 1867 the co-editor of the <em>Radical</em>. He was then appointed as a clerk in the Treasury
      Department in Washington, on behalf of which he took a trip to London in the
      late fall of 1875. On , Whitman
      wrote a letter to William Michael Rossetti to announce a visit from Marvin.
      Rossetti gave a dinner for Marvin, which was attended by the following "good
      Whitmanites": Anne Gilchrist; Joseph Knight, editor of the London <em>Sunday Times</em>; Justin McCarthy, a novelist and writer for
      the London <em>Daily News</em>; Edmund Gosse; and Rossetti's
      father-in-law, Ford Madox
      Brown.<a href="#r13">[back]
