      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I wonder if I have anything to chronicle that will
      interest you? Yesterday was Thanksgiving so I went up to dine &amp; to stay all
      night with the family. We were all there, including the baby, who had been
      especially taught to say "Uncle" for the occasion. After the exile's turkey &amp;
      plum pudding—we had to do without the pumpkin pie of course—we gave a
      play that they had written. It was called "Wilhelmina's Lehrjahre"—an
      imitation of Wilhelm Meister<sup><a href="#n6147" id="r1">1</a></sup>—&amp; depicted the various experiences of a young
      American girl in London. She takes up varieus enthusiasms&amp; joins various
      brotherhoods in succession. Alys<sup><a href="#uva.00553_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> was the heroine &amp;
      Frank Costelloe<sup><a href="#n6114" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; I appeared as the apostles of
      various creeds. In the first scene I explained to her the esoteric meanings of
      aesthetic symbolism, &amp; she makes up her mind to devote herself to the study of
      drapery &amp; colour. But that shortly palls,&amp; in the next scene she appears in
      the country; travelling around in Home Rule van &amp; delivering speeches on the
      Irish Question. Costelloe takes the chair &amp; introduces her with an eloquent
      address to the two old market women that compose the meeting. She then makes her
      address, but in the middle one half the meeting gives a snort &amp; goes out, &amp;
      at the end the other half asks some questions that she is quite unable to answer.
      So
      to she then, having met a young man who convinces her that the only way in which the
      stage can be reformed is by all educated people going on it, determines to become
      an
      actress. This turns out in the next scene to be no greater success &amp; at last she
      is converted to Socialism. This goes all very well for a while until the socialist
      league decides that all women must dress  alike in dresses made out of
      buckram. At this the American girl gives out, says that she is willing to dress
      cheaply, but not unbecomingly, rises in her wrath &amp; says that she is going back
      to America.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The play was really very funny, especially as it was a
      take off on some of our friends, whom Mariechen<sup><a href="#n6109" id="r4">4</a></sup> had invited to see it. We half
      expected, as the play went on that the socialists, politicians, &amp; aesthetics in
      the audience would get up &amp; go out, but everybody took it in good nature. Ernest
      Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> was there &amp; told us about seeing you last June.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Coming down in the train to Oxford I read Specimen Days
      &amp; Collect. I am so glad that the idea came to you of printing those notes, in
      all the books that I have been reading lately, Greek, Latin, or French, there has
      been nothing that has done me so much good. I hope there are more Specimen Days
      forthcoming, indeed, is not a promise of future instalments promised by the word
      Specimen? I think it means that what you have published are only the samples or
      specimens of what you are going to give us later. The student who lives just above
      me is reading Leaves of Grass for the first time, &amp; comes down in the evening
      sometimes &amp; reads is out to me. He is one of our best orators at the "Union"
      &amp; reads very well, you would enjoy hearing him.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope the autumn has not been hard on you,, here it is
      very wet &amp; dismal, but I manage to be out of doors a good deal every day, in the
      healthy Oxford way. You must pardon my type writer &amp; my gossiping letter, but I
      wanted you to know tha that I &amp; all of us often think of you &amp; talk about
      you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>With much love</p>
