      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter reached me this afternoon. I am very glad indeed you are coming home<sup><a href="#nyp.00279_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I already make
      calculations not only of resuming our old talks &amp; good times, but of the much
      news you will have to tell—also of seeing little Jenny again—dear
      child, be sure she is not left out of account—Is Mrs. Channing<sup><a href="#nyp.00279_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> with you then? I send my friendliest remembrances
      &amp; good wishes. And to my ever dear friends, Mrs. Price &amp; family—you
      know how much I think of them, &amp; estimate them always, with love &amp;
      thanks—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is between two &amp; three o'clock p. m.—We have had a snowy day—as I
      look out of my window the ground is white in every direction—William<sup><a href="#nyp.00279_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> has a bad cold, has not been down to work to-day, but has
      just come down town, &amp; is this moment sitting by my desk, reading the extra
      Evening <em>Star</em>—the fight between Congress &amp; the
      President, about Secretary of War,<sup><a href="#nyp.00279_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> rages furiously—The House will doubtless order <em>impeachment</em>—&amp; we are going to have exciting times
      generally—but I guess no appeal to arms—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have heard lately from my dear mother—she is well as usual—Emma Price
      can tell you more directly about her, as I hear, (to my great pleasure) that she has
      called on mother once or twice lately.<sup><a href="#nyp.00279_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> I am well as usual—have not yet
      rec'd a copy of my English re-print<sup><a href="#nyp.00279_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—but hear that
      one is on the way—Mr. Swinburne, the poet, has sent me a handsome copy of his
      <em>William Blake</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00279_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> containing certain mention of me, which I will show you when you come.
      Hotten,<sup><a href="#nyp.00279_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> the London publisher, has written
      me, very handsomely, offering a fee, on every copy—Rossetti, the editor, has
      also written me several letters, very satisfactory—I think you will like your
      apartments, after you get used to them—it is a fresh, sweet, new house<sup><a href="#nyp.00279_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup>—that's a good deal—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And now, dear friend, God bless you &amp; little one, &amp; a safe &amp; speedy
      return to friends &amp; home. 
   </p>

      of <em>William Blake: A Critical Essay</em> (1868), 300–303,
      pointed out similarities between Walt Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the
      Cradle Endlessly Rocking" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which
      he termed "the most sweet and sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the
      world." Included in <em>Songs before Sunrise</em> (1871) was his
      famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America." For the story of Swinburne's
      veneration of Walt Whitman and his later recantation, see Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in England</em> (Cornell: Cornell University
