      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Two or three times within the last half dozen days we have seen (and felt badly about)
      squibs in the papers saying you were "sick"—"not well" "confined to his room" etc
      etc—Each day I have been hoping to get something from you—but as the days pass and
      I do not I am beginning to fear that it is possible that you are not getting on as
      well as usual<sup><a href="#loc.00480_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—and that there may be some foundation for the newspaper stuff—more than usual with
      you
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Walt we all hope and pray that it is not so—yet fear that you may not be as well
      as usual—and hope you will let us know just how you are getting on. The last time
      we heard from you, you said you did not feel quite as well as usual—but that you had
      been out on a long drive and that you were able to get out every day or two—is there
      anything different
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are jogging along as best we may<sup><a href="#loc.00480_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &nbsp;I manage to be at home and with Jess considerable of the time—and often I take her
      with me when I visit the works—and the places where they are building—I find both
      for her and myself there is nothing like the open air—the out doors. As good luck
      would have it we have had a splendid fall as regards weather—and too my work has been
      of such a kind that I could be out much of the time—and this way we manage, after
      a fashion, to put in the days—yet there are times when it does seem as if it was impossible
      to keep up.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is pretty hard on Jess to leave her alone (with servants of course) in the house
      yet at times (for a short time) this does occur, and of course she gives way to her
      feelings, poor child, but I am doing my best to counteract it all I can do
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Walt write upon the receipt of this and let us know how you are &nbsp;We always like
      to hear from you &nbsp;it seems to help—Love of both
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00480_n1">1. On November 5, [1886?],
      Walt Whitman reported to John Burroughs that he "had a bad week...[of] gastric
      &amp; head troubles" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961-77],
      4:53).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00480_n2">2. Hattie had died
      suddenly from enteritis on September 3. She was only twenty-six. In response,
      Walt Whitman wrote Jeff six letters in nine days. Jeff's anguish is recorded in
      Walt Whitman's letter of September 8: "I hope &amp; trust you both bear up under
      it, &amp; that the 'God help us' of your telegraphic message will be fulfilled"
      (<em>Correspondence</em>, 4:47).<a href="#r2">[back]
