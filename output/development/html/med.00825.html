   </p>
   
   <p>In admiration of some of your poems, which I read in an edition, ridiculously
      "expurgated," published by Chatto &amp; Windus,<sup><a href="#med.00825_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> in London, I feel constrained to
      have the Parisian people share the estimation in which I hold your high lyrical
      talent.
   </p>
   
   <p>Would it be too much to ask of you that you indicate the volume (the edition) which
      you would prefer having rendered in the French? My friend, Jules Laforgue<sup><a href="#n4260" id="r2">2</a></sup> (who died
      only too prematurely) has already given to the public two of your poems, and the
      reception they met with seems to presage a new victory for your works.
   </p>
   
   <p>In expectation of your kind reply, Sir and dear poet, permit me to assure you of my
      sympathy in art and of my profound admiration.
   </p>
