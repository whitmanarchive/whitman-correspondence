      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>To day we received the first letter from you, and glad enough we were to get it too.
      The passage that gave me, and Walter too, the most pleasure was the one that said
      you were well, and that all the rest were well also. You say the weather is very cold
      there, here it is just the other way, that is it is pretty warm. I have now begun
      to wear the summer clothes sister Hannah made me which I find very comfortble.
   </p>
   
   <p>It would have made you laugh to see me come home from the post office this morning
      with your letter. Eddy never was so glad when New Year's came, as I was to get your
      letter
   </p>
   
   <p>You must write to us oftener than you have at least twice a month, which we are going
      to do
   </p>
   
   <p>You need not be alarmed about the yellow fever<sup><a href="#nyp.00132_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> as that gentleman will (the folks think) not visit this place this summer. The reason
      they give for that is this. It does not come but once in three or four years, and
      last season it was very hard and killed a great many persons (I mean it does not come
      but once in three or four years in such a shape). Besides it is a great humbug, most
      every one in our office has had (some of them have had it twice) and got well. It
      is caused mostly (I think all of it) by the habits of the people, they never meet
      a freind but you have to go drink and such loose habits.
   </p>
   
   <p>You know that Walter is averse to such habits, so you need not be afraid of our taking
      it<sup><a href="#nyp.00132_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yesterday we were to have a balloon ascension, but just as it was ready to go up the
      balloon bursted so it did not go up, this is the third time she (it was a lady that was to go up
      in it) has tried it and each time failed
   </p>
   
   <p>We are very nicely situated in our new place;â€”just "around the corner" is a very fine
      public park, which we take a walk in every night<sup><a href="#nyp.00132_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I believe I told you in my last letter that I was also at work at the "Crescent" office
      at five dollars a week, and I have the exchange papers for which I get twenty five
      cents per hundred, in a few weeks I expect to get two dollars a week for them
   </p>
   
   <p>If you do not get the paper (the "Crescent") regular you must send Andrew or George
      down to the Eagle office for it, I always see that two copys go every morning. My work is good and light. I have such a part of the mail (and
      I can do it most over night) and then I have nothing to do for the rest of the day
      (I generally get through with it about two o'clock) but stay in the office.
   </p>
   
   <p>We have (I think) got along very well for such a long journey, not a single accident
      occurred on the way
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Father, I hope you are getting along good with your work &amp;c. Mother says it is
      cold so you can't work &nbsp;here it is warm enough. In building houses here they do not
      do as they do in New York. Here they dig a hole in the ground some two feet deep and
      about the same width, and in length as far as the wall is to go, (they can not dig
      cellars here like in the north, you don't dig in the ground more than two feet before
      it is filled with water.) This trench they cover the bottom with boards (the ground
      is mostly made of quick-sand) and then build the wall on it. They cannot mak[e] good
      brick here, so they have to come from a distance. Carpenters wages are very high here,
      some forty to fifty dollars a month and found
   </p>
   
   <p>I will write a letter to you pretty soon, but in this one I must not forget George
      and Andrews
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear brothers, I should like to see you very much indeed but I suppose I cannot, you
      must make Mother or Hannah write to us as often as they can. Theres is nothing, I beleive, there is not any thing here you would like to hear from or of
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Sister,<sup><a href="#nyp.00132_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I should like to see you very much indeed but I suppose you would like to hear about
      the ladies in N. O. They are something like the "critters" in N. Y. except they were
      one or two more "flonces" and live more in the open air &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c
   </p>
   
   <p>to Eddy &nbsp;you must got to school and learn to read and write and then you must send
      letters to me, besides you must be a good boy &amp;c
   </p>
   
   <p>And now Dear Mother I must bid you good bye for a little while but will write to you
      again shortly
   </p>
   
   <p>We are both very well and the warm air argrees with Walter very much</p>
   
   <p>I have had a little attack of the disentery but I am very very well now, in fact I have not been sick much at all</p>
   
   <p>Dear Mother good bye</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00132_n1">1. In 1847, 2,700 people
      died of yellow fever in New Orleans, by far the highest number recorded to that
      date. While Jeff is correct about the tendency of the disease to subside after
      severe outbreaks, it still killed nearly 900 people in 1848 and the same number
      in 1849. The family's fears may have been compounded by the popular view that
      strangers to the city were far more susceptible than natives.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00132_n2">2. The excessive drinking
      of juleps and iced ale disturbed Walt Whitman: "Now you know I am not <em>ultra</em> in these matters, but it isn't good to drink
      spiritous compounds at this rate in hot climates" (quoted in Joseph Jay Rubin,
      <em>The Historic Whitman</em> [University Park: Pennsylvania
      State University Press, 1973], p. 186).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00132_n3">3. Walt Whitman and Jeff
      must have regularly taken long walks together in Brooklyn also. On September 22,
      1852, Hannah commented: "I wish Walter and Jeffy was here [in Vermont] &nbsp;they
      could take long walks enough" (letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman [Trent
      Collection, William R. Perkins Library, Duke University]).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00132_n4">4. Hannah.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00132_n5">5. Walt Whitman added a
      paragraph-long note to his mother at the end of Jeff's letter (Edwin Haviland
      Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961-77], 1:33).<a href="#r5">[back]
