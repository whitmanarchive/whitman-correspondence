   <p>It is a heavy snow storm here to-day—I have many callers, but they are not admitted—as
      I don't care to see them—I write this sitting on the side of the bed, after 4—Don't
      be frightened should you may-be see or hear of any thing in the papers—you know they

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
