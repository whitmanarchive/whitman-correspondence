   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00166_n1">1. This letter bears the
      address: Mrs Gilchrist | 1929 North 22d Street | Philadelphia. It is postmarked:
      Camden | Nov | 11 | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00166_n2">2. After Harry Stafford
      visited Whitman on November 10, and informed the poet that his father was "quite
      unwell," Whitman sent "an affectionate letter" and a small bottle of whisky to
      Mr. Stafford (<em>Commonplace Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). On , Harry urgently
      suggested that Whitman come immediately to Kirkwood. During his stay there from
      November 14 to 17, Whitman learned that George Stafford suffered from stomach
      hemorrhages—hematomesis (see Whitman's letter to Edward Carpenter on ).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00166_n3">3. Since Herbert Gilchrist
      walked to Kirkwood on November 4 and returned on the following day, Harry wanted
      him to be informed of his father's condition (<em>The Commonplace
         Book</em>). Herbert and Harry, however, were not on amicable terms (see
      Whitman's letter to Harry on ). On
       Harry complained to Whitman: "H. G.
      is down yet, he will be down for several days by the way he talks. him and our
      folks get along well, Mother thinks him tip top, and it makes her mad if I say
      any thing against him. she told me the other day if I did not want to sleep with
      him I could go somewhere else for she was not going to keep a bed for me by
      myself." Evidently the two young men were later on better terms, for, according
      to Harry's letter to Whitman on ,
      Herbert invited him to spend the weekend with the Gilchrists.<a href="#r3">[back]
