   </p>
   
   <p>I have your card of day before yesterday.<sup><a href="#loc.05934_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>O'Connor left here yesterday for Buffalo, N. Y., Philadelphia, and home—You
      will likely see him about 20th or a few days later.<sup><a href="#loc.05934_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I
      expect to see you about middle of next month at which time I leave here for a good
      long holiday. I am pretty tired out. Mrs. B. &amp; children are well, weather
      delightfull here and the place looks well
   </p>
   
   <p>I am quite anxious to see you again and have a long chat. What about Mary Smith? is
      she married? Is she back in America, or is she coming back soon?<sup><a href="#loc.05934_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
