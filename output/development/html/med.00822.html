   <p>We have been informed that when you were younger and less famous than now, you were
      in New Orleans and perhaps have helped on the <em>Picayune</em>. If
      you have any remembrance of the <em>Picayune's</em> young days, or of
      journalism in New Orleans of that era, and would put it in writing (verse or prose)
      for the <em>Picayune's</em> fiftieth year edition, Jan. 25, we shall
      be pleased.<sup><a href="#med.00822_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
