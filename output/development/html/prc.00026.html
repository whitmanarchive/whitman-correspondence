      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter yesterday, and was particularly pleased to get it, bringing late 
      intelligence about you all. It was a good letter. What you say about William, fagged
      
      with work &amp; I suppose the weather—&amp; Nelly, half-sick, &amp; Jennie about the same (but
      
      she will soon spring up)—aroused my sympathies—Mother &amp; I talked about them all—I
      send love to all. Nelly, I shall return next week, &amp; then I shall surely come to 
      the house, &amp; see you &amp; all.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Charley, I went leisurely up the Connecticut valley, by way of Springfield, through
      
      the best part (agriculturally, &amp; other) of Massachusetts, Connecticut &amp; New Hampshire,
      
      June 24th &amp; 25th by day light—26th &amp; 27th at Hanover, N.H.—28th &amp; 29th slowly up the
      
      White River valley, a captivating wild region, by Vermont Central R.R. &amp; so to Burlington,
      
      &amp; about Lake Champlain where I spent a week, filling myself every day, (especially
      mornings 
      &amp; sunsets) with the grandest ensembles of the Adirondacks always on one side, and
      the Green 
      Mountains on the other—sailed after that down Champlain by day—stopt at Albany over night, 
      &amp; down the Hudson by boat, 4th of July, through a succession of splendid &amp; magnificent
      
      thunderstorms (10 or 12 of them) alternated by spells of clearest sunlight—Then home
      
      some five or six days—immediately following I was ill, real ill—I suppose the excessive
      
      heat, &amp;c &amp;c—but am now feeling all right.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Upon the whole, I have stood the unprecedented heat pretty well. Mother is not very
      well—has spells of weakness—has rheumatism—then good days again—will break up from
      Brooklyn 
      in September, &amp; go with George, at Camden—as they are vehement for it.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My sister Martha at St. Louis is better far than one would expect, after the alarm
      
      of two months ago<sup><a href="#prc.00026_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—she has since no trouble with the cancer, (or supposed cancer)—Jeff &amp; the children
      well—My sister Hannah, (Mrs Heyde,) in Burlington, I found 
      better than I had anticipated—<em>every thing much better</em><sup><a href="#prc.00026_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Charley, who do you think I have been spending some three hours with to-day, 
      from 12 to 3—(it is now 4½)—<em>Joaquin Miller</em><sup><a href="#prc.00026_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—He saw me yesterday toward dusk 
      at 5th av. on a stage, &amp; rushed out of the house, &amp; mounting the stage gave me his
      address, 
      &amp; made an appointment—he lives here 34th st. in furnished rooms—I am much pleased,
      
      (upon the whole) with him—<em>really pleased &amp; satisfied</em>—<em>his presence, conversation, atmosphere</em>, are infinitely more 
      satisfying than his poetry—he is, however, mopish, 
      ennuyeed, a <em>California Hamlet</em>, unhappy every where—but a natural prince, may-be an 
      illiterate one—but tender, sweet, &amp; magnetic—Love to you, dear Charley, &amp; to all—I
      will soon be with you again—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00026_n1">1. Martha had been east two
      months earlier for consultations with doctors in New York and Camden. Whitman
      also sent his consolations in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00026_n2">2. Whitman here makes a veiled
      reference to the connubial relations of the Heydes.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00026_n3">3. In the manuscript,
      "Interviews with Joaquin Miller," Whitman characterized him as "an ardent,
      pensive, gentle person—decidedly morbid &amp; sensitive—(made a very
      favorable impression on me)" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Whitman
      also wrote of this meeting in his 
      letter to Peter Doyle.<a href="#r3">[back]
