   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00720_n6">1. This letter is addressed:
      <u>U.S. America.</u> | Mr. Walt Whitman | 325 Mickle
      Street | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked: Charing Cross W. C. | [illegible] | [illegible] | 87. There is at least one additional postmark
      on the back of the envelope, but it is entirely illegible.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00720_n2">2. Sir Edward Baldwin Malet
      (1837–1908) was a diplomat from England, representing Britain in the
      various German states (before 1871) as well as other countries around the
      world.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00720_n3">3. Lord Ronald Charles
      Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (1845–1916) was a liberal politican and writer
      from Scotland.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4115">4. Arnold Gerstenberg, a graduate of
      Trinity College, Cambridge, and a Lieutenant in Her Majesty's 20th Regiment of
      Hussars; he committed suicide in October 1887. See <em>The London
         Gazette</em> (December 9, 1887), 6895.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00720_n4">5. For Whitman's response to
      the gift, see the letter from Whitman to Henry Norman of .<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00720_n5">6. Given the poet's precarious
      financial situation, many of his supporters in the late 1880s lobbied for
      granting Whitman a war pension for his services during the Civil War.
      Representative Henry B. Lovering proposed a bill to the House in 1887 that would
      have secured a $25/month pension for Whitman. Ultimately, the bill was dropped,
      though, possibly because of an objection by Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
