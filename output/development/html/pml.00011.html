   <p>As I know you would like to hear from me, my dear friend, I will not yet go to bed—but
      sit down to write to you, that I have been here in Boston, to-day is a fortnight,
      and that my book is well under way. About a hundred and twenty pages are set up—it
      will probably make from six to seven hundred pages, and of a larger size than the
      last edition. It is to be very finely printed, good paper, and new, rather large-sized
      type. Thayer &amp; Eldridge,<sup><a href="#pml.00011_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> the publishers, are a couple of young Yankees—so far very good specimens, to me,
      of this Eastern race of yours. They have treated me first rate—have not asked me at
      all what I was going to put into the book—just took me to the stereotype foundry,
      and given orders to follow my directions. It will be out in a month—a great relief
      to me to have the thing off my mind.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am more pleased with Boston than I anticipated. It is full of life, and criss-cross
      streets. I am very glad I [have] come, if only to rub out of me the deficient notions
      I had of New England character. I am getting to like it, every way—even the Yankee
      twang.
   </p>
   
   <p>Emerson called upon me immediately, treated me with the greatest courtesy—kept possession
      of me all day—gave me a bully dinner, &amp;c.<sup><a href="#pml.00011_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      I go on the Common—walk considerable in Washington street—and occupy about three hours
      a day at work in the printing office. All I have to do, is to read proofs. I wish
      you lived here—I should visit you regularly every day—probably twice a day. I create
      an immense sensation in Washington street. Every body here is so like everybody else—and
      I am Walt Whitman!—Yankee curiosity and cuteness, for once, is thoroughly stumped,
      confounded, petrified, made desperate.
   </p>
   
   <p>Let me see—have I any thing else to say to you? Indeed, what does it all amount to—this
      saying business? Of course I had better tear up this note—only I want to let you see
      how I cannot have forgotten you—sitting up here after half past 12, to write this
      precious document. I send my love to Helen and Emmy.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Abby H. Price
      (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
      husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
      children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
      age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
      were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
      Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for
      the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother in <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 (1908): 163–169. In a letter to Ellen M.
      O'Connor from , Whitman declared
      with emphasis, "<em>they are all friends</em>, to prize and love
      deeply."

      the Boston publishing firm responsible for the third edition of Walt Whitman's
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="pml.00011_n4">3. It was on this occasion
      that, according to Walt Whitman's recollections written twenty years later that
      Emerson attempted to persuade him not to publish the "Enfans d'Adam" poems. The
      date of the meeting was probably March 17, 1860, since on that day Emerson
      obtained reading privileges for "W. Whitman" at the Boston Athenaeum library;

         Biography of Walt Whitman</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1955),
