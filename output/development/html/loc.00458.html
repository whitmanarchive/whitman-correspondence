      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>A Merry Christmas to you all—and many of them—We to-day, have been experiencing about
      as cold weather as one can stand &nbsp;For the last four or five days it has been terrible
      cold—but yesterday it was a little too much for anything &nbsp;10, 12 and down to 20 below
      Zero has been our experience—what do you think of that?
   </p>
   
   <p>Mattie received your letter all right—Mat is feeling about the same—no better, nor
      do I see that she fails much more—she keeps her bed about half her time—she has no
      appetite—has not eaten anything for two months—except her raw eggs and whiskey<sup><a href="#loc.00458_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—this seems to be about the only food that agrees with her—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have had this horse disease here<sup><a href="#loc.00458_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—but not as bad as you have had it East I guess—my horse has been very sick—I thought
      at one time I would lose him but he is getting well again now &nbsp;I hav'nt used him for abt three weeks—nor shall I be able to unless the weather changes, for a long while to
      come.
   </p>
   
   <p>Nothing new—I was up to Chicago for a couple of weeks or so ago—saw Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00458_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> up there—he seems to like it west—he looks first-rate and has plenty to do—I judge
      from what he says all his people like it at Milwaukee
   </p>
   
   <p>I was sorry to hear that George had been discharged from the Brooklyn payroll—I suppose
      however that when they have pipes to make he will get the work again—will he not<sup><a href="#loc.00458_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I do not hear from Brooklyn any more—have not heard for a long time—I had a letter
      from Joe Barkeloo<sup><a href="#loc.00458_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> yesterday telling me that she was about to start for Europe—I suppose she has gone
      ere this—did you hear from her
   </p>
   
   <p>Mattie speaks of you all very often—she would like above all things to see you and
      have a talk—but she is altogether too sick to undertake the journey just now. I was
      sorry, very sorry, that you made up your mind that you would not come this way—as
      I thought, and still believe, that it would have done you both good—but as the season
      now stands of course it would be impossible on account of the weather
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you have quite quiet times—as of course you do not go out much—and I hardly
      expect you make many acquantances—how do you like Camden—I cannot tell how 'tis in the winter—but I remember it last
      summer as being very pleasant and quiet—How does Ed get along without a church to
      attend—or has he obtained a "situation"
   </p>
   
   <p>The children are well as can be and have been fixing up their christmas all day &nbsp;They all send love—Mat and all—I hope dear Mother that your arm is not so
      bad as it was. We think that Mattie is getting better of her lameness—at one time
      she could not use her arm at all
   </p>
   
   <p>All send love to Loo &amp; George and hope you will write when you can—</p>

      <br></br>affectionately Jeff

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00458_n1">1. In October 1868, Walt
      Whitman discussed Mattie's case with Dr. A. D. Wilson of Brooklyn who
      recommended a diet she apparently adopted: "whiskey, wine, condensed milk,
      &amp;c" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961-77], 2:68).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00458_n4">4. Soon after this, George
      took a job as a pipe inspector for the Metropolitan Water Board of New York
      City, although he continued to live in Camden (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> [Durham,
      N.C.: Duke University Press, 1975], p. 30). Jeff's powerful friends in New York
      and Brooklyn, William E. Worthen and Julius W. Adams, may have helped George
      obtain this position. See .<a href="#r4">[back]
