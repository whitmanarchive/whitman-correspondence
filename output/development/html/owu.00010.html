   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="owu.00010_n1">1. A reference to "Walt
      Whitman in Camden" which appeared in <em>The Critic</em> on
      February 28 under the signature of George Selwyn. It was reprinted in <em>Authors at Home</em>, ed. J. L. and J. B. Gilder (1888), and
      in <em>Critic Pamphlet No. 2</em> (1898), in which Whitman was
      cited as the author and a page of the manuscript was reproduced in facsimile.
      Apparently Whitman's original intention was to use the name of Whitman's friend,
      the Camden lawyer James Matlack Scovel, as he had done in the article published
      in the Springfield <em>Republican</em> in 1875 (see the letter
      from Whitman to Rudolf Schmidt of ).
      "Selwyn's" account was filled with factual errors.<a href="#r1">[back]
