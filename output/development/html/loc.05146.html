   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have your card of 
      Aug.
      
       30. Yes, all right—I am satisfied with "Walt Whitman" except that it
      does not express one tenth what it ought to do justice to the subject, but I believe
      it is the best I can do after all and so it must go—as for the paying part of
      the business I am quite easy 
      abt.
      
       that—I think it will pay in the long run and if it does not I am
      equally satisfied except that I would like it to have some circulation on the chance
      of its doing some good.
      Yes, I saw the Santa Fé letter too (thanks
      for it),<sup><a href="#loc.05146_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> and I also saw the 
      N.Y.
      
       Times of 
      Aug.
      
       8th on it—did
      you see it? was it not 
      shamefull? The man glories in his want of sympathy, and laughs consumedly that
      any 
      
      one else should have any. I saw Tommy Nicholson<sup><a href="#loc.05146_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> down town yesterday and he showed me your letter to
      him.<sup><a href="#loc.05146_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> I was well pleased to see that you really have
      some notion of paying us another visit—I hope to see you next month and then
      perhaps we can arrange something—perhaps you will return with me, who knows,
      there may be luck in store for me yet! And you think of "breaking up where you
      are living"? But you must tell me all about it when I see you, please goodness
      that will be soon—but I cannot tell yet when I can get away East, there are
      many things to do first and a great deal to think of—will let you know all
      about it when I know myself—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Santa Fé, New Mexico, a letter of congratulations on the "anniversary of
