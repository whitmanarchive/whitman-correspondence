   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.01370_n2">2. Wilson Barrett
      (1846–1904) was a British actor and playwright who was then performing in
      the United States. He played the lead role in <em>Clito</em>, a
      new blank-verse drama set in ancient Greece, written by the English dramatist
      Sydney Grundy (1848–1914) in collaboration with Barrett. Whitman was
      apparently quite taken with Barrett's acting and even met with him several times
      in early 1887.<a href="#r2">[back]
