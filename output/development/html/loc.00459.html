      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mat has been at me for a long time to write you but I have not been able to get at
      it—Mat's hand and arm is so lame that she is not able to write herself and so I promise
      each day that I will do it as soon as I get to the office—but day after day gets away
      and I do not do it &nbsp;Last night Hattie had a letter from Walt and to-day one has come
      from you—but as Hat has gone to school we shall not know what is in it till she gets
      home &nbsp;Mat also had a letter from Walt<sup><a href="#loc.00459_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> a day or two since and some weeks ago one from Loo—she would answer them all if she
      could write—at times her arm gets a little better but the instant she attempts to
      use it it pains her so that she can hardly live—Her chest pains her some but not like
      it did—her great trouble is her lungs—and I fear she is failing not fast but surely
      in this.—lately even the eggs and whiskey does not agree with her and hearly all the nourishment she has taken has been lemonade—and at times a few raw oysters—and
      now and then a kind of lemon jelly that she has made—she goes down-stairs once a day—generally
      abt 6oclk in the evening to dinner and when she gets to her room again she feels very
      tired and has to go to bed &nbsp;Lately the Dr has had to give her some medicines to make
      her sleep and since she has been taking that her cough has got better a little—I feel
      in hopes however if we do not have too hard a winter that she may get along till spring
      and then I shall get her up into the mountains in Colorado &nbsp;She speaks very often
      about you all and has been much disappointed that you did not feel able to come out
      and see her—she sends lots of love to you all
   </p>
   
   <p>Hattie and Jess are well and growing to be quite big girls &nbsp;they act pretty good and
      work pretty hard what with one thing and another that they have to do—
   </p>
   
   <p>I still am running the Water Works of course—and hope to do so but like all other
      city affairs we are expecting a roust-a-bout from the Legislature this winter—how
      it will all turn out is one of them things that no feller can find out—I was sorry
      to hear that the Brooklyn people had dropped George—as it indicated that they (I fear)
      wished to get rid of him to give his place to some other party—though perhaps this
      is not the case—at any rate he ought to keep posted at what they are doing and when
      he goes to New York <em>always</em> go go over and see them in Brooklyn—tell him to write me after he sees them all and
      tell me who is who and who has charge of the pipe department now whether it be Adams<sup><a href="#loc.00459_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> or Rhodes<sup><a href="#loc.00459_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &nbsp;If Adams I may help him to get back again when they have anything to do
   </p>
   
   <p>We have had the most terrible weather here this winter—cold as could be for a few
      days then mild—to day has been mild but very rainy, damp and just the most disagreeable
      in the world for Mat.
   </p>
   
   <p>Yesterday was fine and warm and clear—but so much frost in the ground that one could
      not stir out with comfort
   </p>
   
   <p>Mat and I and the children often talk about you all and wonder if you can keep warm
      this winter and how you all look—We would like to pop in on you some evening—what
      a jolly time we would all have would we not
   </p>
   
   <p>Give my love to Lu and George and Ed—and when you write Walt tell him how we all are<sup><a href="#loc.00459_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>All send love over and over again</p>

      Whitman sent this letter on to Walt Whitman after she added this postscript:
      "Write to poor Mat Walter dear &nbsp;i am about as usual &nbsp;my cold is not much better
      but it will wear off &amp; pass &nbsp;i thought i would send Jeffs letter."<a href="#r4">[back]
