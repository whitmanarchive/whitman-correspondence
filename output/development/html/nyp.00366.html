   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am in Washington, stopping at Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nash's, L st. south east, Navy Yard—am
      middling well, for me—shall be in pretty sure up to 10 a.m. &amp; from 2 to 3 p.m. Am
      so fixed that it is very convenient 
      for my friends to call—Love to you.<sup><a href="#nyp.00366_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00366_n1">1. On this visit Whitman
      attended a public reburial of Poe's remains in Baltimore, and commented on
      Poe in an unsigned article in the Washington <em>Star</em> on
      November 18, 1875; see <em>The Complete Writings of Walt
         Whitman</em> [New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 4:286–287; and
      Rollo G. Silver, "A Note about Whitman's Essay on Poe," <em>American Literature</em>, 6 (1935), 435–436.<br><br>
      On November 15, 1875, sixteen Washingtonians sent a petition to Benjamin H.
      Bristow, Secretary of the Treasury: "We respectfully ask that Walt Whitman,
      'the Good Gray Poet,' may be appointed to a position in the Treasury
      Department." The docket in the National Archives reads: "The Secretary says
      give the applicant a place Jany. 1, '76 if possible." Though Whitman
      apparently did not comment on this proposal, Burroughs knew of it, and wrote
      to Dowden in April 1876: "We expected he would have a position in one of the
      Departments at Washington again before this, as it was promised last winter,
      but nothing seems to come of it yet" (Clara Barrus, <em>The
         Life and Letters of John Burroughs</em> [Boston, New York: Houghton
      Mifflin], 1:183).<a href="#r1">[back]
