      <br xmlns="" class="opener">April 20. 1878.
      
      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I saw Mr. Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r2">2</a></sup> in New York, lately, &amp; he encouraged me to believe that I might get from you some
      news of your new book. I am anxious to see some proofs or early sheets, in order to
      write an account of it to the London Academy. If it is possible, will you oblige me
      in this matter?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have confessed to Burroughs my admiration of the spirit you have breathed into the
      air, to enlarge &amp; stimulate the after-         
      
      
      
      comers, the young writers of America. At times, I have had an intense longing to express
      my gratitude to you yourself; &amp; it was a sharp disappointment to me that I could not
      come down to Mrs. Gilchrist's,<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r3">3</a></sup> last summer, with the young Englishman, Carpenter,<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r4">4</a></sup> to meet you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But I am not gifted with the faculty of praising. Where I greatly admire I am most
      likely to be silent; &amp; I never felt it quite the time to speak to you. Well, this
      time is not come now; it hardly comes at all. The secret of our reluctance to make
      
      
      
      acknowledgement to those whom we owe much in the spiritual way is, probably, that
      we know it is impossible ever to give adequate utterance to such matters; &amp; to speak
      at all is almost to obscure the sentiment instead of revealing it. If I myself could
      choose, &amp; had done anything, I would by preference take silent recognition, though
      personal expression of appreciation is certainly a great balm, at times.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In writing, now, I have another project to advance, besides that of seeing your new
      book. I am getting up a volume of poems to be published anonymously by Messrs. Roberts
      Brothers,<sup><a href="#n0886" id="r5">5</a></sup> of Boston. Of course these are of the
      
      
      
      older &amp; prevalent fashion. They are by a number of poets, some of whom are very well
      known. I don't know whether you will feel like participating in this scheme; but there
      are some advantages about it which may strike you. If they do, I would greatly like
      to have you send me two or three short pieces with a view to insertion in this book.
      Owing to the general character of the collection, however, your contribution would
      have to conform to the more usual rhythms at least as far as "Captain, my Captain!"<sup><a href="#n0887" id="r6">6</a></sup> Have you anything lying by you—especially of a patriotic tone?
   </p> 
   
   <p>There is time enough yet; the copy will not be prepared for the printers until September.
      But, if you look favorably on the plan, please let me know before long.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Meanwhile, the new book.</p>         
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Very sincerely yours,
      <br></br>G.P. Lathrop.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think you have corresponded with Albert Otis, a lawyer of Boston, whom I know. You
      have more appreciators here than you suspect.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0885">1. George Parsons Lathrop
      (1851–1898) was an American poet and novelist. For more on him, see <em>The Twentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable
         Americans</em>, ed. Rossiter Johnson and John Howard Brown (Boston:
      Biographical Society, 1904) 360.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">2. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0259">3. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0141b">4. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n0886">5. The Roberts Brothers were
      bookbinders and publishers in Boston. The firm began publishing around
      1860.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0887">6. "O Captain! My Captain!" was one of
      Whitman's most popular poems, although it is atypical of his verse and style
      (the rhyme, meter, stanza and refrain are conventional, and the poem makes use
      of traditional metaphors). It first appeared in the <em>Saturday
         Press</em> on November 4, 1865.<a href="#r6">[back]
