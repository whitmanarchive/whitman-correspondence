      [I approve of your attempt to translate certain of my poems into the German tongue.
      Indeed, arrogant as the statement may seem, I had more than my own native land in
      view when I was composing Leaves of Grass. I wished to take the first step toward
      calling into existence a cycle of international poems. The chief reason for being
      of the United States of America is to bring about the common good will of all mankind,
      the solidarity of the world. What is still lacking in this respect can perhaps be
      accomplished by the art of poetry, through songs radiating from all the lands of the
      globe. I had also in mind, as one of my objects, to send a hearty greeting to these
      lands in America's name. And glad, very glad, should I be to gain entrance and audience
      among the Germanic peoples.]<sup><a href="#n6022" id="r2">2</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.

         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
