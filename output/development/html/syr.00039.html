   <p>Willy Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; I went to New York Monday evening<sup><a href="#syr.00039_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> [/] put up at Grand Union Hotel 42d Street [/] —I
      saw Johnston<sup><a href="#n0336" id="r4">4</a></sup> next day and lunched with him—they all asked
      most particularly after you. I saw J's new store (Union Square) he seems to be doing
      well but says he needs more capital than he has. We had a long conference with our
      New York lawyer and decided on a line or action in reference to the meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup>. We left
      N.Y. 6 o'clock last evening and after a very pleasant run of 17 3/4 hours arrived
      at
      London 11.45 today, 5 minutes (only) late. Find my folk all well and the asylum in
      good shape—a lot of work had accumulated which it will take a few days to wade
      through but that is nothing. As things look now I hope to be down your way again
      early in the summer, meanwhile you must keep me posted as to your health &amp;c
      &amp;c. [—] I find a book (sent for before I left home) [a]waiting me
      here—"The Bacon-Shakspere question answered" by C. Stopes.<sup><a href="#syr.00039_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> He /(rather <u>she</u>
      <u>Charlotte</u> Stopes[)] /believes S. wrote the <u>plays</u>—I expect to find the volume interesting and
      will send it to you if you would like to see it as soon as I gave run through it.
      [—] Willy Gurd &amp; myself (though we should have been glad to found a
      company for the manufacture of the meter in Phil<u>a</u>) are not
      the least discouraged by our failure. We believe more strongly than ever that the
      meter is immensely valuable and that we shall eventually carry our plans
      through—the only subject of regret on my own part / (except regret on
      Horaces<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r7">7</a></sup> account). /is that I shall not see you as much in
      the immediate future as I had hoped but I trust a few months will make this all
      right—all the folk here were greatly interested to hear from me all about you
      and they were much pleased that I could give so good an account of your health.
      (though certainly you might easily be better than you are).

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="syr.00039_n1">1. Horace Traubel's note,
      "see | notes | March 22 | 1889," appears in the upper right-hand corner of the
      recto. The reference is to Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman

   <p id="n4284">2. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="n0336">4. John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="syr.00039_n3">6. Bucke is referring to Charlotte Carmichael
      Stopes's <em>The Bacon Shakespeare Question Answered</em>,
      2nd ed (London: Truber &amp; Co., 1889). As Bucke states here, Stopes believed that
      Shakespeare had written the plays attributed to him. The title of her book, however,
      
      refers to arguments that Shakespeare's plays had been written by Francis Bacon.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">7. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
