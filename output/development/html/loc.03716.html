      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Received yours of the 10<u>th</u> this
      morningâ€”the papers also. Wrote to you in the Spring, when Bjornson was in
      America. Did he come to 
      se
      
       you? Of course not: you are an old paralytical man, who can be of no
      [
      <span class="unclear">use?</span>]
       to him!
   </p>
   
   <p>In more than four years the parents of Clemens Petersen have had no news from him. Have you
      seen his name in papers or periodicals? Perhaps he has died, and no friendly hand
      has been there to close his eyes or send information to Denmark. If
      
      
      
      you should 
      known
      
       anything relating to him I should be very obliged to you for communicating
      it to me.
   </p>
   
   <p>The young Norwegian poet Kristian Elster died for some months ago just having
      finished the best book he ever wrote. He was a heart's ease growing in the shadow:
      the leaves are turning white from want of sun!
   </p>
   
   <p>The Icelandic poet Steingrimur Thorsteinsson (Reikjavik, Iceland) takes great
      interest in your poems, as far as he has been acquainted with them. Forward a copy
      of "leaves of Grass" to him (via Leith) He is an old friend of mine.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I have published a great volume of talks this autumn. But it would be too difficult
      to tell
      you anything about them.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your "Spirit that form'd this scene" is powerful and splendid. I shall translate it.
      The editor of "Illustreret
      Tidende" (our
      "Illustrated News") has declared himself willing to publish your image and biography
      as soon as there may be an occasion. Most probably the book of Mr Bucke (London
      Ontario) will
      turn out to be a good project. Has the book appeared? He promised to [
      <span class="unclear">send it me?</span>]
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Are you well. I have
      been suffering very much from Rheumatism on the last days.
