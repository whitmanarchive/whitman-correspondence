   <p>Fine &amp; sunny to-day—feeling fairly—all going smoothly—In

         water</em> in literature, politics, theology, even science—resting on our
      oars &amp;c. &amp;c.—criticising, resuming—at any rate <em>chattering</em> a good deal (of course the simmering, gestation, &amp;c.
      &amp;c. are going on just the same)—but a sort of <em>lull</em>—a good coming summer to you &amp; Mrs. B<sup><a href="#n4273" id="r8">8</a></sup> &amp; all of

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n3115">2. Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935)
      was a translator and poet from France, who commented positively not only on
      Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and
      apparently liked the critic's work on <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>—Whitman even had Sarrazin's chapter on his book translated
      twice. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="uva.00476_n1">5. Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
