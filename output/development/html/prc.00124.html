   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles E. Shepard, following in the footsteps of
      his father George H. Shepard, managed and edited the <em>Long Islander</em>. Hiram A Baylis
      became publisher after Charles' death in 1927 (Paul Bailey ed., <em>Long Island: A History
         of Two Great Counties Nassua and Suffolk</em> [New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Co., Inc., 1949],
      347).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00124_n1">1. This letter is
      addressed: Charles E. Shepard | editor Long Islander newspaper | Huntington,
      Suffolk Co: New York. It is postmarked: Camden NJ Dec 19 88.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">2. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00124_n2">3. If Shepard wrote to
      acknowledge the receipt of Whitman's package, the letter is now lost. Shepard
      was an editor on the <em>Long-Islander</em>, the paper Whitman
      founded in 1838. See <em>Daybooks and Notebooks, Volume 2</em>,
      ed. William White (New York: New York University Press, 1978), 479, where the
      poet lists Shepard as one of only sixteen people to receive <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> in December 1888.<a href="#r3">[back]
