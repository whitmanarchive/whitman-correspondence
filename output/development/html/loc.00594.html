   <p>I have not forgotten you in the wanderings from Washington here.  After five days
      and nights jolting in the cars I reached this point and was put on duty instanter—And
      such duty!  Why I have worked night and day and it appears there is more to do now
      than when I came.
   </p>
   
   <p>They only allow one steward to each Hospital, and it is an irksome office when such
      is the case. I am doing finely and in the course of a few weeks I think will have
      some leisure time. The Hospitals here were in a destitute condition, compared with
      those of the North. When I came to this Hospital they had no clothes to change <em>one fourth</em> of the patients. I immediately appealed to my lady friends and patriots in Philadelphia,
      and they have sent me on a fine lot of sanitary stores, yet not enough for the wants
      of the many admitted. Our Hospt is a large five story building and accommodates between
      300 &amp; 400 patients, most of whom are wounded in the continual skirmishing about Murfreesboro
      and Franklin.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have never had better health in my life, perhaps I can explain it to you. I have
      five young ladies who act in the capacity of nurses—i e, <em>one of them is French</em>, young and beautiful to set your eyes upon. Can you not visit us and note for yourself?
      I think a change of climate will be beneficial.
   </p>
   
   <p>How are Jack and Amos?<sup><a href="#loc.00594_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> I wish you would give me Amos's address, as I have lost the one he gave me. My regards
      to them and hope they are out of Campbell Hospital. What became of poor Dick?
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been so busy I have neglected all correspondence so you will readily forget
      the seeming neglect

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00594_n2">1. Whitman saw Amos H. Vliet in
      the hospital tent at Falmouth on December 22, 1862, and mentioned him briefly in
      an article that appeared in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> of
      March 19, 1863 (Richard Maurice Bucke, ed., <em>The Complete
         Writings of Walt Whitman</em> (New York, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902),
      7:95–96). According to his diary (Charles I. Glicksberg, <em>Walt Whitman and the Civil War</em> [Philadelphia: University of
      Pennsylvania Press, 1933], 133), Whitman wrote a (lost) Letter to Vliet on May
      2, 1863. "Jack" has not been identified but may refer to John Lowery. According
      to Whitman's jottings in "New York City Veterans" (Glicksberg, 67), he
      discovered John Lowery (here spelled Lowerie) on December 22, 1862, "in the
      Hospital on the ground at Falmouth." In <em>Specimen Days</em>
      (Richard Maurice Bucke, ed., <em>The Complete Writings of Walt
         Whitman</em> (New York, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902), 4:51), Whitman writes:
      "I saw him lying on the ground at Fredericksburg last December, all bloody, just
      after the arm was taken off. He was very phlegmatic about it, munching away at a
      cracker in the remaining hand—made no fuss."<a href="#r1">[back]
