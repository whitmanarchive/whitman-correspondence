   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00618_n4">1. Richard Maurice Bucke dated
      this letter "shortly after" Martha Mitchell Whitman's death on February 19,
      1873, which narrows the range of dates to late February or early March. Edwin
      Haviland Miller presumably dated it March 23?, 1873 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:370). Miller's date is correct because of this letter's many
      similarities to Walt Whitman's 
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Louisa's letter acknowledges receiving
      "papers" in response to a query in Walt's letter, expresses her satisfaction
      that Walt has received a letter from Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, and echoes
      Walt's phrase "extra work" to explain her not receiving a letter from Jeff.
      Therefore, since Walt's March 21, 1873 letter to Louisa is almost certainly the
      one that she acknowledges as "your letter yesterday," the earliest date for this
      letter is March 23, 1873. Since Louisa's  letter to Walt is dated "monday" in her own hand, it must follow
      this one. Therefore, this letter dates to March 23, 1873.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00618_n7">2. Walt Whitman wrote, "I send
      some more papers, to-day." He referred also to receiving a letter from Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and to Jeff's "extra work" for Kansas City, Missouri
      (see Walt's  letter to
      Louisa).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00575_n9">3. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
      adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
      he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
      St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Jeff
      Whitman. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta "Hattie"
      (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" (b. 1863). In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to join Jeff after he had assumed the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in 1867. For more on Mattie, see
      the introduction to Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00616_n4">4. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman (1836–1873) died on February 19, 1873 from complications
      associated with a throat ailment that had first been noted by her husband Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in February 1863. Mattie and Jeff had two daughters,
      Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St.
      Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
      emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26. Waldron reports that a physician identified the cause
      of death as cancer (3). Robert Roper has speculated that Mattie's accompanying
      bronchial symptoms may have been associated with tuberculosis (<em>Now the Drum of War</em> [New York: Walker, 2008], 78–79).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00597_n3">6. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward moved from Brooklyn to
      reside with them in Camden in August 1872. For more information on George, see
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00618_n14">7. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882), the Chief Engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works and a close
      friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman during his time there from 1862 to
      1867, was also George Washington Whitman's employer when he began inspecting
      pipe for the Brooklyn Water Works. After departing Brooklyn in 1869, Lane
      eventually became the City Engineer of Milwaukee. George was probably inspecting
      pipe at the R. D. Wood Foundry sites in Camden and Florence, New Jersey, and at
      the Gloucester Iron-Works. The Iron-Works, an enterprise founded by directors
      formerly associated with Star's Foundry in 1864, specialized in casting pipes
      for water and gas distribution (see the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's
      finding aid to the R. D. Wood &amp; Co. Records, 1858–1910,
      http://hsp.org/sites/default/files/legacy_files/migrated/findingaid1176wood.pdf;
      and see George Reeser Prowell, <em>The History of Camden County,
         New Jersey</em> [Philadelphia: Richards, 1886], 594).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00618_n11">8. For George Washington
      Whitman's earlier prospect of work, which led him to travel to Brooklyn, see
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter
      to Walt Whitman. A few days later Louisa wrote that "george aint like to get the
      brookly [<em>sic</em>] work" (see her  letter to Walt). But on March 24 George again
      entertained the "prospect of getting the brooklyn work" (see Louisa's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00618_n12">9. George Washington Whitman
      was employed in early 1873 at Star's Foundry (Walt Whitman wrote "Starr's) in
      Camden, New Jersey.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00618_n16">10. Easton, Pennsylvania, on
      the Delaware River, was the site of numerous iron foundries.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n7">11. The "aunt" who was engaged
      to assist Louisa "Lou" Orr Haslam has not been identified. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman described Lou's aunt as English, and Louisa was not fond of the aunt's
      company: "i wouldent be very sorry if aunty wasent here" (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). She is named "aunt Lib" and "aunt Libby" in Louisa's  and  letters to Walt.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n6">12. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n4">13. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r13">[back]
