      14 Milborne Grove,<br></br>Brompton W.<br></br>London, England.
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Oct. 12.
      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I regret to say that our hopes of getting out the complete and arranged edition of
      your Poems with O'Connor's Introduction is at present remote.
      Just as I was beginning to consult about the matter
      I found that John Camden
      Hotten had already contracted with W. M. Rossetti to prepare and edit a volume of
      selections from your Poems. I found that Hotten is not yet ready to bring out the
      whole work as we would wish. My first feeling at hearing of this arrangement was one
      of regret. On thinking the whole matter over however I came to think that such an
      arrangement as that was not without some advantages. In the first place 
      its
      
       a thing which cannot be prevented. Americans have not granted the English
      any protection for their works or choice about bringing them out, and in the absence
      of a just law on the subject no one can claim property in his work over here. I may
      say in passing, however, that in reply to a letter from me to Mr. Hotten he 
       told me that he meant
      to share with you the pecuniary profits of the venture, and spoke in an honorable
      tone.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now the advantages I see in the plan of having Rossetti edit the selected volume are
      these: I believe that it is the best means of paving the way for a public demand for
      the entire work. The English people are the very ones to desire that which is
      reserved. Until there is such a popular demand no publisher can be found to print
      the poems which are now quite extensive. In the next place it is far better, in my
      opinion and that of your real friends here, that the introduction of you to the
      general public will come much more gracefully from an English literary man than from
      any American. No introduction could easily surpass in simple breadth that which
      O'Connor has written; and some day it must appear; but his reputation here is
      confined to the few who have read his noble pamphlet, and, which is still more
      important, it can never have so much effect here for an American to praise American
      work. It says more for your work that has kindled enthusiasm in the mind of one of
      another nation, 
       and one whose good
      judgments cannot be ascribed to personal friendship more than to national pride.
      These facts together with the assured social and literary position of Rossetti make
      him of all persons of my acquaintance the fittest I could name to undertake the
      work. It at once secures the <u>position</u> of your work. The
      criticism which he wrote in the <u>Chronicle</u> will show you
      the spirit in which his work will be done, and I know that he is putting a great
      deal of very careful work upon his introductory essay. I have passed an evening with
      him. He tells me that his plan will be to divide up the Poems according to their
      subjects; e.g. "Poems of Democracy," "Personal Poems," "Poems of Friendship," etc.
      He does not intend to alter any of the Poems he publishes. His volume will I should
      judge include about one half you have written. There will be
      footnotes explaining "phebe–bird" and other
      things not known in England so far as he can.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now for some questions he wishes me to ask you: What is <u>Calamus</u>? I could not tell him, satisfactorily, either the exact thing you
      meant or its metaphorical meaning to you. Again,
      Rossetti admires very much indeed your introduction
      to 
       the first edition of
      the "Leaves of Grass," and wishes to publish it; but he is deterred by a few words.
      He wishes to know whether you will not send him a word instead of
      "father–stuff" (p. 7, 17th line from bottom) and if on p. 10, bottom lines,
      you will allow him to alter "venereal sores or discolorations," "onanist" and "any
      depravity of young men." These are the only words he anywhere wishes to modify. The
      essay is a great one &amp; would have a great effect; but if you do not permit the
      alterations he will not print it—as he goes on the honorable principle that he
      has not the right to change an author's language.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now, my dear friend, I hope that on reflection you and O'Connor will think as I do
      (who am on the ground) that on the whole we had best feel good naturedly toward this
      plan of Hotten's and Rossetti's. We are not here up to the point yet, but are
      rising, &amp; this book will help us I am quite sure. The other day the Saturday
      Review which once ridiculed Leaves of Grass began a review of some American's poems
      by saying that nothing related to America had appeared in its literature with the
      simple exception of Walt Whitman's works. The word had its effect. And now
      goodbye.
   </p>
   
   <p>Let me hear from you as soon as you can, and</p>
