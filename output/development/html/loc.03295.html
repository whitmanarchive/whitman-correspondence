      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I enclose the letters from Riley and Bathgate you sent me long ago, and which should have been returned earlier, and would have
      been but for the maelstrom confusion in which I have lived the sad year past. All
      the letters you told me to forward to Bucke went on to him
      except one, which was overlooked, and has been sent lately.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was very much touched with what Ruskin wrote, which seemed to
      me to be very strongly on your side. You appear to  have a different impression, judging by
      some remarks you make in a letter of last October, and perhaps have some other
      information. It seems a great thing to say, as Ruskin does, that your book "is
      deadly true—in the sense of rifles—against our deadliest social
      sins"—and also that its fruit is "ungatherable save by loving and gleaning
      hands, <u>and by the blessed ones of the poor</u>." I understand
      this as a high endorsement, coupled with a bitter indictment of English society. But
      maybe mine is a misreading.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I never told you about 
      Macaulay's article on you in the "Nineteenth Century."
      It is certainly very fine, and I greatly enjoyed it. His reservations were
      completely oversloughed by his eulogy.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Do you hear any more of Rolleston's German translation?</p>
   
   
   <p>The <u>Nation</u> this week (I have just seen it) does not print
      my reply, which may have come too late, and perhaps will appear next week.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your postal card of the 14th came. What a good time you
      must have. Well I know that delightful  Germantown landscape, and the unmatched
      Wissahikon.
   </p>
   
   <p>The enclosed about the Nirvana is good. I never believed that the Buddhist meant
      annihilation.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I sent Tucker one of Bucke's books, in souvenir of the
      gallant stand he made for you against the authorities. Did you send Mrs. Ritter one? I want to avoid sending to anyone who may have
      received the book already. You have probably sent one to Mrs. Gilchrist.
   </p>
