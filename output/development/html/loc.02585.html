      <br></br><br></br>My dear Uncle Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I thought you would like to see your little Kittie's face so send my photograph
      wishing with it that you may have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. We
      have once more a nest but need one dear person to make the family complete; this
      person is a Grandpa; won't you come and be one to us; we would all be so happy if
      you came. There is a pretty park in front which is nice even in Winter; at night the
      electric lights are  very pretty. Then in Summer you could walk in the park with us
      children as you used to do on 5th Ave. Do come when ever it pleases <u>you</u> (but I want you <u>very; very</u>
      soon!)
   </p>
   
   <p>I go to a school about a mile from here which gives me a nice walk on pleasant
      days.
   </p>
   
   <p>We children expect to go to "Little Lord Fauntleroy"<sup><a href="#loc.02585_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> sometime this week.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good bye now, Dear Uncle Walt, hoping to see you soon,</p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      I am,
      <br></br>your loving little
      <br></br>Kittie.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Katherine (sometimes spelled
      "Catherine") B. Johnston (b. 1874) was a daughter of John H. Johnston, a jeweler
      and close friend of Whitman's. Katherine had at least six siblings, four of whom
      were older and two that were younger. When Whitman visited the Johnston family
      for the first time early in 1877, Katherine ("Kittie," "Kitty") would have been
      three years old.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02585_n1">1. <em>Little
         Lord Fauntleroy</em> was a children's novel by English-American novelist
      Frances Hodgson Burnett (1849–1924) and was a sensation when published in
      1886; the stage adaptation of the novel opened on Broadway in December of
      1888.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0336">2. John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
