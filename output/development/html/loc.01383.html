   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4195">2. Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), a volume Whitman often referred to
      as the "big book," was published by Philadelphia publisher David McKay in
      December 1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, he made the presswork and
      binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the book, which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more information on
      the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n3137">3. Rachel Pearsall Conn Costelloe
      (1887–1940), later known as Ray Strachey, was the first daughter of Mary
      Whitall Smith Costelloe. She would later become a feminist writer and
      politician.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4979">4. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01383_n2">5. Writing on , Robert Pearsall Smith informed
      Whitman of events in the family: Alys was to attend Bryn Mawr College in the
      fall, Logan was studying at Oxford, and Mary had a second child. Robert's wife
      Hannah wrote on  to Whitman about her
      granddaughter's birth (see also <em>Smith Alumnae Quarterly</em>
      [February, 1958], p. 88). Hannah was no admirer of the poet, and Whitman once
      said of her: "She still believes that the world is to be persuaded, driven into
      salvation. I do not—never did!" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.12.html">Friday, April 19, 1889</a>).<a href="#r5">[back]
