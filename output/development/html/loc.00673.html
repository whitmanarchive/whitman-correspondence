      Burlington<br></br>Tuesday morning

      <br></br><br></br>My dear Brother
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How are you this morning.—I wish I was where I could come in and see you and do something
      for you—that has been a trouble to us. that we 
      cant
      
       be of the least benefit to you now when you are ill. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You 
      dont
      
       know anything about how bad and sorry I felt about your illness
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You have been exceedingly kind and thoughtful dear brother to write to me, that first
      letter was very welcome I was wonderfully glad to get it, a little afraid you was
      not hardly yet strong
      enough 
      
      
      
      to write.—Dear Mother too has been kind about writing I expect a line every day
      I am anxious to hear.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have not heard for eleven days—I do so hope to hear the good news that you
      are better, and are able to go out a little
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I feel glad when 
      its
      
       bright pleasant weather I think maybe you will gain faster,—I know my dear brother
      you have a good deal of patience and that you do not easily get discouraged and that
      too is in your favour,—You have a good many friends I know, and have every attention,
      every little thing
      
      
      
      done for your comfort that can be done, do you not Walt,—Still it would seem better,
      to us, if some of us was near you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Has George been to see you I suppose he has though</p>
   
   
   <p>And dear brother Jeffy too I know as soon as he can think of anything he will go to
      see you. I should like to hear from him and the dear little girls
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Do you remember Walt some years ago, what a bad time I had with my back (I think it
      was neuralgie of the spine) anyway I was well only my back I could not walk three
      steps for many weeks &amp; could sit up all day, &amp; when I could walk about &amp; even go up
      &amp; down stairs I was a good deal more than half bent over, &amp; I was bent over so nearly
      as bad for more than a year,—I only speak of it so you will know how much time will
      do, my back is now as strong as it ever was in the world
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I do so want you to get well Walt, I shall be so happy when you are strong as ever
      again, and persons tell me you will be, a good many inquire about you.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You know your room here is always ready. I do hope when it warm weather, in June you
      will come, I remember you liked the mountain air here and I know it will be good for
      you And I have been thinking if dear Mother too could bear the journey. for it would
      seem just like home to you then, and I do not think it safe to stay in Washington
      like you did last summer, &amp; Charlie has a great wish to go away to the Adirondacks
      &amp; other places, &amp; 
      its
      
       a great bother to leave the house alone with me, &amp; I would do every
      thing in my power for you, dear brother
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I 
      dont
      
       know why I have not written to you before, I wish I had 
      somethin
      
       cheerful to tell you, things are just the same here I only want you to be well again
      I do like that young fellow that is so kind to you, Peter Doyle, I shall always remember
      him
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">Good bye my dear brother, I send you a great
      deal of love, Charlie also sends love
