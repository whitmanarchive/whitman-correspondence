      <br></br><br></br>Dear Nelly,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I sent you the Weekly Graphic No. 2 yesterday—wish you to take an opportunity, when
      convenient, 
      &amp; loan it to those two dear ladies, Mrs. Johnson &amp; her sister mentioned in my article<sup><a href="#nyp.00326_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—&amp; please give them my best remembrances. Dear Nelly, how are you getting along, this
      winter?—We have just had a snow storm here—cold &amp; while, as I look out, and the sleigh-bells
      
      occasionally jingling by—I am sitting here alone in the parlor by the heater, 
      as I write. I am alone most of the time, (to all intents &amp; purposes.)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I feel that I am better, in the main—yet still have daily &amp; nightly bad spells in
      the head, 
      &amp; my leg most of the time disabled as ever. In fact not much different from the same
      old story—(yet certainly a good streak, or vein, of encouragement, &amp; feeling of encouragement—maintaining
      itself—accumulating—never more than temporarily leaving me.) 
      I even begin to think about coming back to Washington &amp; trying it again.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nelly, I sent a P.O. check for $50 to Charley last Friday to pay my young man<sup><a href="#nyp.00326_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—haven't rec'd any word from Charley yet, up to this present writing<sup><a href="#nyp.00326_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—hope it came safe—may hear from him, this afternoon or tomorrow. Charley 
      is always so prompt in responding. I hear regularly from Peter Doyle—he is well &amp;
      hearty, works hard for poor pay, on the Balt &amp; Potomac RR., 
      works nights a great deal. He writes me regularly every week. I have been 
      waiting ever since I wrote,<sup><a href="#nyp.00326_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> to get the photos. of my nieces, (my dear sister Mat's girls,) returned from New
      York, &amp; send them to you—but have not yet got them. Shall write for them. My "song
      of <em>the redwood tree</em>," 
      in last Harpers is copied a little, &amp; abused &amp; sneered at in the newspaper criticisms,
      
      a good deal, (from what I glean)—<em>of course</em>, that last makes me feel <em>very bad</em>—I expect to have another piece in February<sup><a href="#nyp.00326_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Harpers—(but am not certain)—"prayer of Columbus"—as I see it now I shouldn't wonder
      if I have unconsciously put a sort of biographical dash in it—Nelly dear, write oftener—put
      in all the gossip &amp; items that will be next best to seeing you—do you see Dr. Drinkard—I
      sent Garaphelia Howard<sup><a href="#nyp.00326_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> a paper, the Graphic<sup><a href="#nyp.00326_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> that has my picture—how is she? Is she married? Give her my love—Poor, good Mr. Dille<sup><a href="#nyp.00326_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>—yet amid all its sombreness &amp; terror how blessed to die "by touch ethereal," 
      painless, instantaneous—Nelly, death has become to me a familiar thing—Yet, as I sit
      here writing, 
      I do not feel a particle less of life in me, than ever.
      
   </p>

      God bless, you, dear, dear Nelly.
