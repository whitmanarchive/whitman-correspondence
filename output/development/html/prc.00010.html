   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00010_n1">1. William Conant Church
      (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
      York newspapers until he founded the <em>Army and Navy
         Journal</em> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
      he established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. Financial control of
      the <em>Galaxy</em> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
      was absorbed by the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1878. William
      published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
      Francis wrote for the New York <em>Sun</em> the unsigned piece
      "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." See Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the
      <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952),

      On August 1, 1867, William Conant Church, from the office of the <em>Galaxy</em>, wrote to William Douglas O'Connor: "It seems
      to me that this glorious harvest of 1867, sown &amp; reaped by the returned
      soldiers, ought to be sung in verse.…Walt Whitman is the man to chaunt
      the song. Will you not ask him to do it for The Galaxy?" (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.). The editors, in a letter to Walt Whitman on
      , considered "A Carol of
      Harvest, for 1867" (later titled "The Return of the Heroes") "to rank with
      the very best of your poems." The poem appeared in the September 1867 issue
      of the <em>Galaxy</em>. For images and a transcription of "A
      Carol of Harvest, for 1867" as it appeared in the September 1867 edition of
      the <em>Galaxy</em>, see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00192.html">"A Carol of Harvest, for 1867"</a>.<br><br>
      Whitman acknowledged receipt of $60 as compensation for "A Carol of Harvest,
      for 1867" in his  letter to
      the <em>Galaxy</em>, in which he also submitted a second poem,
      "Ethiopia Commenting," unpublished by the magazine.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00010_n3">3. On , the editors replied that they had
      no objection to Walt Whitman's using the poem in a book.<a href="#r3">[back]
