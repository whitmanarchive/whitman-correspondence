   <p>If all the talks of you which are heard in our family were telephoned to your ear,
      you would have daily communications from the house of Johnston.
   </p>
   
   <p>"Uncle Walt would enjoy this;" "I wish Uncle Walt could hear that;" "If Uncle Walt
      were only here," are frequent exclamations. Indeed you have had, since the sad event of
      thirteen years ago, (does it seem so long?) a central place in the <u>heart of the home</u> and it was there I met and welcomed
      you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Now another change is about to take place: (and who knows whether life or death is
      more momentous?) the marriage of Grace.<sup><a href="#n7015" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>You know how lovely she is in voice and feature: but you cannot know how every best quality of
      her parents is mingled into a perfect whole. To me, her second mother, (by law, her
      first in devotion) she has always been a daughter indeed! Nothing could surpass the
      filial love she has given me: the confidence in my judgment: the loving obedience
      to
      every requirement. The aid, The encoureagement, the companionship she has given me
      since reaching the level of womanhood.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is not easy for me to give this to a man: nor easy for her to turn her face away from the
      sweet care-free maidenhood: leave the dear sheltered home—next the
      companionship of sisters: and take all at once wife-hood mother-hood,—the
      burden of a wealth-sustaining matron!
   </p>
   
   <p>For you have doubtless heard that the man she is to marry has both children and
      money: (burdens or blessings as we make them.) Fortunately—though without
      these qualities he would not have gained his
