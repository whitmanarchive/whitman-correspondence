   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of the 7th came to hand some time ago, but I have not as yet taken time to answer
      it. I have been about sick with a cold on my lungs, since after my days work was done
      I did not feel like writing.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you are enjoying good health this winter. I am going to give up my [

       the first of this. I dont think it avisable for me confine myself [
      <span class="unclear">to?</span>]
       a stone.
   </p>
   
   <p>My health will not admit of it. I Rec a letter from Miss Norwone last evening stating that her sister died last fall—I
      had not heard from her since I left Washington. How I pity her.
      
      
      
      Often when my mind [illegible] back to the days that I spent in Armory Square, I can but cry. I often think I see
      her coming toward me, and the same sad smile on her countenance as in those days.
      I cannot tell how much I owe you &amp; Miss Hroard for favor while in Hospital at Washington.
      I lost a very near and dear friend and Brother in the service of the United States
      and I know how to pity those that meet with similar losses.
   </p>
   
   <p>I cannot write more at present But beleive me sincerely your true Friend although
      I am far away from you.
   </p>
   
   <p>My Hearts desire is that you may live a long and happy life and when you leave this
      Earth you may be prepared for a better life—
