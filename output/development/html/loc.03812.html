      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p>In hasty answer to your request asking me to specify over my own signature what
      years I worked as an editorial writer in the Brooklyn <em>Times</em> office I would say that if I remember right it was along in
      1856, or just before.<sup><a href="#loc.03812_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> I recollect (doubtless I am
      now going to be egotistical about it,) the question of the new Water Works
      (magnificently outlined by McAlpine,<sup><a href="#loc.03812_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> and duly
      carried out and improved by Kirkwood,<sup><a href="#loc.03812_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> first-class
      engineers both,) was still pending, and the works, though well under way,
      continued to be strongly opposed by many. With the consent of the proprietor, I
      bent the whole weight of the paper steadily in favor of the McAlpine plan, as
      against a flimsy, cheap and temporary series of works that would have long since
      broken down, and disgraced the city.
   </p>
   
   <p>This, with my course on another matter, the securing to public use of Washington
      Park (Old Fort Greene,) stoutly championed by me some thirty-five years ago,
      against heavy odds, during an editorship of the Brooklyn <em>Eagle</em>, are "feathers in my wings" that I would wish to preserve.
   </p>
   
   <p>I heard lately with genuine sorrow of the death of George C Bennett.<sup><a href="#loc.03812_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> I remember him well as a good, generous, honorable
      man.
   </p>
   
   <p>I send best greetings to your staff, and indeed to all the Brooklyn
      journalists.
   </p>
