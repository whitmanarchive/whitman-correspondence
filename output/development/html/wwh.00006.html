      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Jeff must have got quite a long letter, (three sheets,) I wrote Thursday or Friday
      last<sup><a href="#wwh.00006_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—nothing particular. This is the fifth letter I have sent with shinplasters in—(Since
      George's $3 got lost I am more on the alert and mention them)—
   </p>    
   
   <p>The poor Frenchman d'Almeida<sup><a href="#wwh.00006_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>I told you about in my last, got out of the Old Capitol prison this morning—has been
      in a week—it was a most ridiculous thing putting him in—he was as square a man as
      I am—while he was in, the chief officer of the prison laughed sarcastically one day
      at his broken English, and d'Almeida said, "Sir you ought not to laugh—you ought much
      more to weep, to see a poor traveler like me in such a misfortune"—and Mr. Chief Officer
      immediately called the guard and sent d'Almeida to the guard-house for that <em>awful offence</em> of making such an answer. The guard-house is a nasty, lousy dungeon without light—in
      it was a nigger with his wrists in manacles, and four white deserters—there is among
      the Old Capitol prisoners a little boy of seven years old—he and his father were taken
      as secesh guerillas in Virginia, and the government is holding on to the child, to
      exchange him for some Union prisoner south, in an exchange. Mother, my heart bleeds
      at all sorts of such damnable things of one kind or another I meet with every day—it
      is not the fault of the President—he would not harm any human being—nor of Seward<sup><a href="#wwh.00006_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> or Stanton<sup><a href="#wwh.00006_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—but the heartless mean-souled brutes that get in positions subordinate but where
      they can show themselves, and their damned airs and pomposity—they think nothing of
      treating a man like the worst slave-owner is supposed to treat his niggers—
   </p>
   
   <p>Meanwhile the great officers of the government have every minute occupied with pressing
      business, and these wretches have full swing. It seems impossible that there could
      be in the Free States such tyrants, as many you see hereabout—This d'Almeida is a
      very modest man, a real French gentleman, poor, and quite distinguished as a traveler
      and man of science—and is a Professor in the Academy of France. He takes or appears
      to take his misfortunes very goodnaturedly—yet it must have cut pretty deep on some accounts, he suffered every humiliation.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, dearest mother, how does it go at home? I hope you are none of you going to
      move—I hope it is arranged that you shall stay—there would be something dissatisfactory wherever you should go. I was real glad to hear Jeff had abandoned the idea of building,
      this spring—to attempt it without money is winding onesself round and round in the devil's own net.<sup><a href="#wwh.00006_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I saw Frederick Ellison here yesterday—he is a young man that used to be in Hughes's
      store there above Cumberland street<sup><a href="#wwh.00006_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—he is in the 9th N. Y. Militia—has just come from Brooklyn, where he has been on
      a furlough—
   </p>
   
   <p>I would be glad to hear about Han—I must write to her very soon. I have not heard
      from George since. Yesterday I spent the day at Emory Hospital—a very needy place—I
      gave out a great many things, and about $4 in money—it was a good day. I was covered
      with mud, getting there. (I dont mean good <em>weather</em>, it rained hard)—

   <p>Jeff, I shall write a few lines soon to Mr. Rae—also to the firm that contributed
      the $10.<sup><a href="#wwh.00006_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> I have not yet rec'd the engravings.

   <p id="wwh.00006_n1">1. This letter is apparently
      lost.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="wwh.00006_n2">2. Joseph-Charles d'Almeida
      (1822–1880), a professor and author of <em>Problèmes de
         physique</em> (1862), came to the United States in 1862. In the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection at the Library of Congress, there are three interesting
      letters from d'Almeida to William Douglas O'Connor, a close friend and associate
      of Whitman's. From Memphis, Tennessee, on January 28, 1863, d'Almeida explained
      that because of the kindness of a Miss Rebecca Harding he had been introduced to
      "<em>la société rebelle</em>." On March 2, 1863, he asked
      O'Connor to visit him in the Old Capitol Prison in Washington, D.C. The <em>Washington National Republican</em> of this date listed
      d'Almeida among refugees who were committed to Old Capitol Prison for
      examination. From New York, on March 27(?), d'Almeida wrote his farewell letter
      after he had been to Boston, where he had been entertained by James Fields, and
      had met Longfellow, Emerson, and Agassiz: "I carry with me a little American
      library in which the LEAVES of Grass are included."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="wwh.00006_n3">3. William Henry Seward
      (1801–1872) was secretary of state from 1861 to 1869 under Presidents
      Lincoln and Johnson.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="wwh.00006_n4">4. Edwin McMasters Stanton
      (1814–1869) was secretary of war from 1862 to 1868.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="wwh.00006_n5">5. On , Jeff wrote that he had decided to
      "wait for cheaper times" when he discovered that what he "supposed would cost at
      11 or $1200 could not be done for less than 20 or $2100".<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="wwh.00006_n6">6. In the Brooklyn Directory
      of 1859–1860, Ellison was listed as clerk. The name did not appear in the
      Directories of 1861–1862 and 1865–1866. Oscar F. Hughes had a store
      at 373 Myrtle Avenue. In 1861–1862, the Directory cited "house
      furnishings," and in 1865–1866, "glass ware."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="wwh.00006_n7">7. On , Jeff sent to his brother $10
      from Hill and Newman (a firm that has not been identified: Henry P. Hill, James
      Hill, and Warren Hill were engineers; Simon Hill, Samuel Hill, and Thomas Newman
      were contractors) and $5 "from our friend Mr. E. Rae": "I know Rae is a liberal
      hearted man and through his friends he could do a great deal and I am confident
      that he could be more earnestly interested in the matter if you write him
      directly." This was probably E. H. Rae, a law copyist with an office at 16 Wall
      Street, New York.<a href="#r7">[back]
