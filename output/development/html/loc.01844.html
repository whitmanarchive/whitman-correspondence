   <p>Yours [

       [illegible] came to [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">afternoon?</span>]
      —contents safe.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>What you [illegible] a variety of thoughts. I have long [illegible] <u>enthusibility</u> an indispensible foundation [illegible] <u>heroic life</u>. Besides numerous other "good" [illegible] as almost everybody else would call them, I [
      <span class="unclear">have?</span>]
       in my mind the instance of my first wife [
      <span class="unclear">an?</span>]
       girl whom I became acquainted with at a school I attended in my 15th year, and married
      when I was just 18 yrs &amp; 2 days old—(mind you! I had no father, mother, sister, and but one nude, repellent
      brother and his wife a good match for him.) Now, that girl of mine for 10 years was
      the purest, gentlest, and generally the most cheerfully amiable person that <u>[
         <span class="unclear">could be imagined?</span>]
         </u>—I "fairly" <u>worshipped</u> her from [
      <span class="unclear">beginning?</span>]
       to end, and was perhaps as happy [
      <span class="unclear">in marriage?</span>]
       with her as a man could possibly be [illegible] Yet she had that [
      <span class="unclear">fault?</span>]
      —I don't [illegible] got or could get the <u>thought [illegible]</u> into her head—she appeared [illegible] pervious to the [illegible] of enthu[
      <span class="unclear">siasm?</span>]
       [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">in?</span>]
      deed my life with her  
      
      was somewhat painful, as [illegible] be sure that with my extreme [illegible] or fastidiousness in the business of [illegible] could keep her really contented with [illegible]ing my [
      <span class="unclear">principles?</span>]
      . When it [
      <span class="unclear">became necessary?</span>]
       in order to retain my home that [illegible] <u>reconstruct</u> my family, I preferred to [
      <span class="unclear">be content?</span>]
       with less of amiability if I could [
      <span class="unclear">secure?</span>]
       more strength or vitality. I thought it would be too great a task to <u>hunt the world over</u> for <u>a perfect match</u>. The present Mrs "Philosopher" is not destitute of various desirable qualities—she
      is very "shrewd," and <u>too nice</u> a housekeeper—Yet she is another one of the sort <u>not enthusible</u>. Perhaps you have noticed that I could have sent you some considerable "heart-offering"
      without trying to be able to <u>justify</u> [
      <span class="unclear">myself?</span>]
       by knowing you to be in absolute want [illegible] Mrs. Philosopher can't rule me, and [illegible] rule her! [
      <span class="unclear">If you?</span>]
       should wish to know [illegible] than from [
      <span class="unclear">myself?</span>]
       whether I am [illegible] <u>"good enough" man</u>, please [illegible] that there [
      <span class="unclear">is?</span>]
       means by which you [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">explain?</span>]
       who [illegible] the oldest resident [illegible] prominent merchants, lawyers [illegible] this country.

      <span class="unclear">righteous opposition?</span>]
       to a world on the other—also [illegible] of father, uncle and cousins. (Probably you would not give a "fig" for more evidence.)
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I find myself nothing like so happy a man as I was before the war—yet my property
      losses never troubled me <u>"one bit"</u>, and <u>few</u> of my near relatives lost their lives or otherwise badly "hurt". I have come to have
      a poorer digestion, and have met up with so many petty [
      <span class="unclear">"classes"?</span>]
       from the <u>insignificance</u> of the <u>moral strength</u> of "people" as [

       [illegible] that I suppose to be chief cause [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">repression?</span>]
      . I find however a sort [illegible] a change of belief about [illegible] question—when I thought [illegible] direct work of a "Creator" [illegible] help being angry with Him [illegible] making of <u>mean</u> souls.
      
      
      
      Also when I could have a [illegible] belief [illegible] Free Will I [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">more?</span>]
       than [illegible] [

   </p>
   
   
   <p>(Please let us not waste time or [

       by arguing upon any points of difference in our opinions on any subject—I dont ask
      any long letters from you—only a card sometimes to tell of your health and happiness—There
      is not much <u>political</u> difference—with a white-hot temper or heart I unite a wonderfully thoughtful cool,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.
