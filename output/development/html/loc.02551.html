   <p>I have rec'd your letter, money, &amp; order for Joaquin Miller's books, &amp; had just prepared
      them to send, 
      when I have rec'd a letter from J. M. saying he will soon be in Philadelphia<sup><a href="#loc.02551_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—&amp; that I must lay the 
      books aside for him to take, when he calls personally on me, which will be soon.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am much annoyed about the postage mishap. I have written to the P. M. at New York,
      &amp; hope he will make 
      restitution,—as the package was <u>not sealed</u> at ends, (only wrapt over &amp; tied, to protect the gilt edges)—at least twenty packages
      have been sent <u>in precisely the same way</u> (one or two to N.Y.) and this is the 
      only one that has been served so. If the P.M. don't <u>restitute</u> I must be allowed to pay it—not because 
      it is important, but because it is my affair—&amp; <u>business</u>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you an extra copy of my little War book, same mail with this—Shall write you
      soon definitely about coming on—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
