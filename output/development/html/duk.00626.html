   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00626_n12">1. This letter dates to April
      21, 1873. Richard Maurice Bucke dated this letter April 21, 1873, which fell on
      Monday, the day of the week in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Edwin
      Haviland Miller concurred with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:215, n. 70). Bucke's and Miller's date is correct. Louisa Whitman acknowledged
      two recent letters from Walt Whitman, one received on the date of this letter
      and one received the previous Saturday. The letters that she received were
      Walt's letters of  (received
      Saturday) and .<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00556_n3">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n6">4. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">5. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00625_n11">6. George Washington Whitman
      was building a larger house on a corner lot at 431 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey (see Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975], 31). For an extended description of George's planned house, see Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt
      Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00626_n14">7. The phrase "anything or
      not" is written in the right margin.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00626_n13">8. The "aunt Lib" or "aunt
      Libby" who was engaged to assist Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman has not been
      identified but was probably named Elizabeth. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman described
      her daughter-in-law Louisa Orr's aunt as English, and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      was not fond of the aunt's company: "i wouldent be very sorry if aunty wasent
      here" (see her  letter
      to Walt Whitman). The aunt is designated "aunt Lib" in Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's  letter to
      Walt.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00626_n5">9. Between the words "dignity"
      and "now" Louisa Van Velsor Whitman canceled the phrase "it would bee all good
      to have my."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00626_n9">10. For an extended description
      of the house that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman imagined she, Walt Whitman, and
      Edward could share, see her  letter
      to Walt. Walt may have initiated this fantasy with the remark "if you &amp; I
      had a house here" (see his 
      letter to Louisa).<a href="#r10">[back]

      inverted in the top margin of the first page.<a href="#r11">[back]
