   </p>
   
   
   <p>Here I am yet, in my big chair in the parlor—I am up &amp; around, but not very
      well—I am having a return, (though not so severe,) of those old <u>blurs</u> that used to trouble me—have had a succession of
      them all day to day so far—begun yesterday—but I have no doubt they
      will pass over. It is cloudy &amp; sulky here to-day, partially thawing—&amp;
      is raining now—I have been out, managed to walk round the block, but had to
      return—did not feel well. Pete there is nothing new—I got your last
      letter—have rec'd letters from Mrs. O'Connor—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have no doubt I shall
      feel better—my sickness comes &amp; goes—&amp; my relief spells the
      same—I shall probably have to stay in the rest of the day &amp;
      evening—which is very dull &amp; stupid for me—in fact quite
      dismal—But I must not write what will make you blue—would rather cheer
      you up—I am still continuing the pieces in the Weekly Graphic<sup><a href="#loc.01640_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—(will be ended with one or two more)—expect to have a piece<sup><a href="#loc.01640_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> in
      next Harper, (March) but am not certain—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Just as I close, the carrier has tapped at the window—he brings me a letter
      from Boston,<sup><a href="#loc.01640_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; in it a check paying a debt due me a long time, &amp;
      which I had quite given up—which puts me in better spirits—good bye for
      present, my dear loving son—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
