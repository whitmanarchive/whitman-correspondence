   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00374_n1">1. This letter's envelope bears the
      address, "E W Gosse | Townsend House North Gate | Regent's Park | London
      England." It is postmarked: "Camden | May | 19 | N.J.; London. N W | F 6 |
      Paid | My 29 | 76."<br><br>
      Gosse (1849–1928) had written to Walt Whitman on : "I can but thank you for all
      that I have learned from you, all the beauty you have taught me to see in
      the common life of healthy men and women, and all the pleasure there is in
      the mere humanity of other people." He reviewed <em>Two
         Rivulets</em> in <em>The Academy</em>, 9 (June 24, 1876),
      602–603, and visited Whitman in 1885. In a letter to Richard Maurice
      Bucke on October 31, 1889, Whitman characterized Gosse as "one of the
      amiable conventional wall-flowers of literature" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0273">2. Sir Edmund William Gosse (1849–1928), English
      poet and author of <em>Father and Son</em> (a memoir published in
      1907), had written to Whitman on : "I can but thank you for all that I have learned from you, all the
      beauty you have taught me to see in the common life of healthy men and women,
      and all the pleasure there is in the mere humanity of other people" (see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.65.html">Friday, June 1, 1888</a>). Gosse reviewed <em>Two
         Rivulets</em> in "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/rivulets/anc.00075.html">Walt Whitman's New Book</a>," <em>The Academy</em>, 9 (24
      June 1876), 602–603, and visited Whitman in 1885 (see Whitman's letter
      inviting Gosse to visit on  and
      <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–1977], 3:384 n80). In a letter to
      Richard Maurice Bucke on , Whitman
      characterized Gosse as "one of the amiable conventional wall-flowers of
      literature" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). For more about Gosse, see Jerry F.
