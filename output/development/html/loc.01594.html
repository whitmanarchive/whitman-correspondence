      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.01594_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well here I am back again in New York—Have had a pleasant trip down east—went down
      the bay there after I wrote you last—&amp; also a visit around among 
      the factories of Rhode Island. Some of them are very large—regular little towns. 
      The Spragues, two brothers,<sup><a href="#loc.01594_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> employ 7000 workmen in their factories alone. 
      Some of the owners are men of immense wealth. I write this early in the forenoon,
      
      sitting in my room in 55th street, after breakfast. As to getting my leave extended
      
      so that I might stay to vote, I have settled (as I spoke of in a former letter)<sup><a href="#loc.01594_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> 
      to pair off with a friend of mine here who was going to vote for Seymour, and 
      return on time. The weather is cool &amp; clear to-day. I shall probably not make 
      out much [of] a letter to you this time, Pete, as I feel rather stupid yet this 
      morning. I guess I slept too hard, or perhaps, as they say, I got up wrong end 
      foremost. But I thought I would write one more letter, for the last. I believe 
      it is about the eleventh. I hope you have enjoyed reading them as much as I 
      have writing them—for that, I <em>have</em> enjoyed. You too have done first rate, 
      &amp; have sent me as many as I have you, and good letters too. I am now going 
      out down town, &amp; across to Brooklyn, to spend a few hours with my mother. 
      I don't know whether I told you that my sister with her two young children 
      from St. Louis, arrived the night before I left N. Y. &amp; will stop with 
      mother this fall &amp; winter—her health is not very good.<sup><a href="#loc.01594_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall return 26th. Take care of yourself. Dear Pete, we will soon be together again.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
