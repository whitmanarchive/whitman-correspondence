      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The enclosed $10 is from Mr James P. Kirkwood<sup><a href="#loc.00424_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> for the use of the Hospital soilders &nbsp;I will mail you another letter with some more money to-morrow
   </p>
   
   <p>How goes things with you, Walt? What about coming home? I have not written you very
      lately, I have been so very busy. Mother and the rest are about the same. Andrew does
      not get better. I fear than Andrew will never get better. He looks very bad rather
      a painful case. I yesterday wrote you a letter and enclosed some money from myself,
      after thinking the matter over I destroyed the letter and shall give the money to
      Andrew, did I not do right
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In acknowledging the receipt of money from me please state the amount but not who
      from as I dont want them to know that I dont send any myself but I honestly think when I possibly can give any thing that I ought
      to give it to Andrew. All the rest of us are the same as usual &nbsp;Mattie and the babies
      are very well. the little one is growing finely and is getting to be quite a youngster
      &nbsp;Hattie is growing up well &nbsp;I often wish you was at home &nbsp;I think you would enjoy
      her very much and it would be beneficial to her &nbsp;Jess is about the same. He is not
      very strong, but does not get worse I think. I should like to have one of the old
      fashioned letters from you, and cannot you send me the letter to go to Davis<sup><a href="#loc.00424_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> before the 12th as the steamer goes out then
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Did you write to Wm Davis at Worcester, if not wont you do so,<sup><a href="#loc.00424_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> and if you have leasure write to Mr Kirkwood sometime if you will<sup><a href="#loc.00424_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &nbsp;I will give you his address &nbsp;Mr Kirkwood is travelling around the eastern states
      on horseback and is not very well. I think a letter from you would do him good. Let
      me hear from you. I will write you again to-morrow.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00424_n1">1. James P. Kirkwood
      (1807–1877), a prominent civil engineer and cofounder of the American
      Society of Civil Engineers (1852), superintended the construction of the
      Brooklyn Water Works as chief engineer from 1856 to 1862. After his work in
      Brooklyn, he moved to St. Louis and designed the waterworks which Jeff would
      later build. Kirkwood eventually became a nationally known independent
      consultant and wrote the standard text on water filtration.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00424_n2">2. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. A lifelong friend of Jeff's, he became city engineer of Boston
      (1871–80) and completed his distinguished career as chief engineer of the
      American Telephone and Telegraph Company (1880–1908). Whitman probably did
      not write this letter to Joseph Davis; he makes no reference to it in either his
      correspondence or his diary.<a href="#r2">[back]
