      <br></br><br></br>You dear (young) old fellow:<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.02994_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
      
   </p>   
   
   <p>I was just feeling to-day a lack in my soul—a gap—an idea that you had
      not been heard from—when—comes yr card.<sup><a href="#loc.02994_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I had no idea O'C.<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r3">3</a></sup> wd have 'fits' It seems terrible. The letter I sent
      Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r4">4</a></sup> contained so cheery news that this last is an
      unpleasant surprise. Well this is the worst month in the year. Let us wait patiently
      for god's (nature's) grass &amp; dandelions again. Death is no evil to good or bad.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am reading Browning<sup><a href="#n0116" id="r5">5</a></sup> still; manage to extract considerable from his rubbish; he is a
      great fellow for subtle soul-searchings &amp; delvings in the past. But I can't <u>heartily love</u> any except <u>our</u> kind of
      men—cheerful—the Scotts, George [illegible]nds,
      Homer, Emerson,<sup><a href="#n0218" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp;c. Browning deals in the sad &amp; horrible almost—[illegible]
   </p>
   
   <p>By the way, I am feeling deep sympahty for poor Frank Sanborn.<sup><a href="#n0915" id="r7">7</a></sup> I suppose you saw the notice that his son—a promising 
      young fellow, 23 or so, committed suicide. Do you suppose it was love &amp; money combined—the
      cause—? He was writing a little for Springfield Republican. Sanborn père
      had a col. in that paper about him, giving extracts from his verse-poems. They
      were real pretty, unusually good, in some respects. Sanborn seems to be having a
      tough time these days. May his philosophy &amp; well stored literary mind stand him well
      now!
   </p>
   
   <p>Burroughs—has he gone into burrow? In one of his dark mumpish spells, think
      you? He don't answer me. I sent him a ply of new kind of wheat coffee some months
      ago &amp; got a good letter. I send him a Transcript occasionally, with horticultural
      report. (I can't realize that you
      have been shut up there so long. You are <u>a hero</u>.
      I tho't you never cd stand
      it not to get to natur[illegible]. Keep heart.)

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br> William Sloane Kennedy,
      biographer, editor, and critic, was one of Whitman's most devoted friends and
      admirers. Kennedy first met Whitman in Philadelphia in 1880 while working on the
      staff of the <em>American</em>. He soon became a frequent
      correspondent and visitor to Whitman's Camden, New Jersey, home, a constant
      contributor of small gifts, and the author of several essays and newspaper
      articles in praise of Whitman. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine
      Reagan,"<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>"" Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia,

      Walt Whitman | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked: North Cambridge, Sta. | Mar
      | 19 | 8AM |[illegible].
      There is what what is likely a Camden postmark that is only partially

   <p id="n2002">3. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">4. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n0116">5. Robert Browning (1812–1889) was an English
      poet known for his dramatic monologues, including "Porphyria's Lover" and "My
      Last Duchess." Browning was also the husband of poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning
      (1806–1861).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0218">6. Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) was an
      American poet and essayist who began the Transcendentalist movement with his
      1836 essay <em>Nature</em>. On , Whitman informed Ralph Waldo Emerson that "" was "put in type for my own convenience,
      and to ensure greater correctness." He asked Emerson to take the poem to James
      T. Fields, editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, who promptly
      accepted it and published it in February 1869. For more on Emerson, see Jerome
      Loving, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_1.html">Emerson, Ralph Waldo [1809–1882]</a>," <em>Walt

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0915">7. Franklin B. Sanborn
      (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
      he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
      the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
      reviewed <em>Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Boston
         Commonwealth</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00059.html">February 24, 1866</a>. He was editor of the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
      his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
      appeared without Sanborn's name in the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K. Walker,

   <p id="n4318">8. Alexander Gardner (1821–1882)
      of Paisley, Scotland, was a publisher who reissued a number of books by and
      about Whitman; he ultimately published William Sloane Kennedy's <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> in 1896 after a long and
      contentious battle with Kennedy over editing the book. Gardner published and
      co-edited the <em>Scottish Review</em> from 1882 to 1886.<a href="#r8">[back]
