      Transcript.<br><br>
      On , Edward Carpenter ordered books
      for Charles G. Oates. Evidently Oates himself wrote for a copy of <em>Two Rivulets</em>, which Whitman sent on September 7, 1876
      (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839â€“1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). The
      transcription of this note in the Stanford Library is dated "Sept 7th,
      1881," which, in view of the entry in his Commonplace Book, is an error.
      When the postcard was sold at the Rains Galleries on April 14, 1937, the
      year was cited as 1876.<a href="#r1">[back]
