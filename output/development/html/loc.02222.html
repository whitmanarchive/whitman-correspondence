      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I do not know whether you saw a little paragraph in a recent number of the
      Critic—in the Lounger's department. I have not seen Dr.
      Bucke's book, but I was told that he had done me the honor of
      quoting some verses of mine. I was asked whether those verses were written for the
      book, or about yourself, and I said 
      
      
      
      "No—they were published in
      the magazine some time ago and were suggested by another writer." I am very sorry
      that paragraph appeared as it did, or at
      all, as it might look as if I were not a friend and admirer of the subject
      of the book.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Are you coming North this summer? I wish you would come and see me at Marion, on
      Buzzard's Bay in Mass. If you will give me the slightest encouragement I will try to
      get Burroughs there to meet you. Splendid pine woods—good 
      
       
      
      fishing and
      boating—a quiet little whaling village. Think well of it and let me know by
      return mail
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Very sincerely yours
      <br></br>R.W. Gilder.
      <br></br>Walt Whitman Esq.
   </p>
