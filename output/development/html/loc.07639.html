   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy and Richard
      Maurice Bucke were two of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Kennedy
      (1850–1929) first met Whitman while on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> in 1880. He became a fierce defender of Whitman
      and would go on to write a book-length study of the poet. For more about
      Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian physician,
      was Whitman's first biographer, and would later become one of his medical
      advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of Bucke and
      Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n6122">2. Logan Pearsall Smith
      (1865–1946) was an essayist and literary critic. He was the son of Robert
      Pearsall Smith, a minister and writer who befriended Whitman, and he was the
      brother of Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, one of Whitman's most avid followers.

   <p id="n4264">3. Louise Chandler Moulton
      (1835–1908) was an American poet and critic who published several
      collections of verse and prose, as well as regular contributions to the <em>New York Tribune</em> and <em>Boston
         Herald.</em>

   <p id="loc.07639_n2">4. On  O'Connor commented on Mrs. Moulton:
      "Her fault was in being too Araminta-Seraphina-Matilda." Whitman agreed: "I
      can't endure her effusiveness: I like, respect her: but her dear this and dear
      that and dear the other thing make me shudder" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.40.html">Friday, March 1, 1889</a>).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07639_n3">5. On April 15 Whitman had
      borrowed Boswell from Harned: "I have never so far read it" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.18.html">Sunday, April 15,1888</a>). The poet did not respond to Johnson's
      "ponderous arrogance" (Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.21.html">Wednesday, April 18, 1888</a>), but continued to read the work "as a
      duty" (Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.29.html">Thursday, April 26, 1888</a>). He remained unimpressed when he finished
      the work on May 13 (Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.46.html">Sunday, May 13, 1888</a>).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n0301">6. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker from Long
      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his
      influence on Whitman, see David S. Reynolds, <em>Walt Whitman's
         America</em> (New York: Knopf, 1995), 37–39.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="loc.07639_n4">7. The bust of Hicks was
      sculpted by Sidney Morse (1832–1903), a self-taught sculptor as well as a
      Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to 1872, editor of <em>The
         Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden many times and made various busts
      of him.<a href="#r7">[back]
