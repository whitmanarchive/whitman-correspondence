   <p>In the letter I sent you yesterday ab't the Worthington matter, I spoke of W probably buying with the plates a lot of the
      old Boston edition in sheets—Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#uva.00385_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> yesterday stopt at Leavitt's (the auctioneer's) in N Y. &amp; to-day I receive from B the following postal:
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Leavitt sold the plates to a Mr Williams (for Wentworth of Boston) in Sept: 79 for $200—Leavitt never saw or heard of any <em>sheets</em>—Worthington must have bo't the plates from Williams—He must have printed from them

   <p>I thought I might as well let you know every new discovery &amp;c—and shall continue to
      do so—

   <p id="uva.00385_n1">1. Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke
      was in Philadelphia on December 5, evidently on his way to New York, where he
      apparently investigated the Worthington matter (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
