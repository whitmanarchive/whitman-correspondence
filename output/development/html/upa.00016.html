   <p>Your letter of July 8<sup><a href="#upa.00016_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> has reached me, &amp; is comforting, as always. I must write
      you at least a line or two. Don't mind my long silences. My illness has not lifted
      since I last wrote you, &amp; is still upon me—the last two or three months the bad
      spells have been frequent &amp; depressing. Yet I keep up, go out a little most
      every day, &amp; preserve good spirits.

   <p>I am cheered &amp; pleased by the <u>friendly &amp; living

      them by me—look at them often—they do me good.

   <p>I have just sent you a paper. When you write, tell me more about your children—Percy<sup><a href="#upa.00016_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; all. Love to

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00016_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Mrs. Anne Gilchrist, | Earl's Colne, | Halsted, Essex, | England. It is
      postmarked: Camden | Jul | 27 | N.J.; Philadelphia, Pa. | Jul | 28 | Paid All;

         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00016_n2">2. Though Anne Gilchrist
      wrote frequently, Whitman allowed almost two years to elapse between his
      replies. In the midst of her accounts of the activities of her children,
      Gilchrist reaffirmed her ardent affection. On , she wrote: "I believe if I could only make you
      conscious of the love, the enfolding love my heart breathes out toward you, it
      would do you physical good. Many sided love—Mothers love that cherishes,
      that delights so in personal service, that sees in sickness &amp; suffering such
      dear appeals to an answering limitless tenderness—wifes love—ah you
      draw that from me too, resistlessly—I have no choice—comrades love,
      so happy in sharing all . . . Child's love too that trusts utterly, confides
      unquestioningly" (<em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt
         Whitman</em>, ed. Thomas B. Harned [Garden City, NY: Doubleday, Page &amp;
      Company, 1918], 113). On , Gilchrist noted that a year ago (see Whitman's , letter) she had received Whitman's
      ring "that put peace and joy and yet such pain of yearning into my
      heart—pain for you, my Darling &amp; sorrowing helpless love that waits
      and must wait useless, afar off, while you suffer" (Harned, 117). On , she begged: "So please, dear Friend, be
      indulgent, as indeed I know you will be, of these poor letters of mine with
      their details of my children &amp; their iterated &amp; reiterated expressions
      of the love and hope and aspiration you have called into life within
      me—take them not for what they are, but for all they have to stand for"
      (Harned, 120).<a href="#r2">[back]
