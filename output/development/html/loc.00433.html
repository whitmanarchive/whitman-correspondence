   </p>
   
   <p>Mother received your letter<sup><a href="#loc.00433_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> to-night—we were all very glad to hear that you arrived so nicely and were so well
      established—The enclosed two letters came to-day<sup><a href="#loc.00433_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I sent the box to dear brother George yesterday at noon directed just as you left
      word—I got some hoop iron and straped the box up strong—I dont suppose there can be anything wrong in sending it straped in that way—do you suppose there is? I had in it a ham piece of smoked beef can of
      milk (condensed) coffee can of peaches—crackers—potatoes—salt—and the clothes that
      he sent for—I think I will send him another next week or week after—We were all elated
      upon seeing the letters published yesterday about the exchange of prisoners.<sup><a href="#loc.00433_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> O I so hope they will make an exchange—can you not write something that will keep
      up the talk about the matter, sometimes little weights when the[y] fall at the right
      moment turn the scale and accomplish great results &nbsp;Seems as if twould be worth almost a life time to help along such a thing as the general exchange of
      prisoners—
   </p>
   
   <p>so you have assumed the duties and honors of an officer of the government<sup><a href="#loc.00433_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> &nbsp;Mother was wondering at tea to-night what you would have to do—I told her that undoubtedly
      the first thing would be to calculate just exactly how many little indians John Brown<sup><a href="#loc.00433_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> did have—as that was the first thing the clerks had to do in the Indian dept.—What
      the devil is the Indian dept.—? It is suggestive of scalps, war and paint—whiskey
      and laziness &nbsp;However I suppose you have not yet had time to tell what the business
      is about but anyhow if it is only a comfortable berth without too much hard work,
      it will come in good<sup><a href="#loc.00433_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—I hope you will have good health—I would suggest that you should not go it too strong
      in the Hospital way, for a while—I would draw it mild for a month or so—How does it
      seem to you to go back—I suppose it looks quite natural—I hope to be able to come
      and make you a visit soon—probaly some time next mont[h]—Write to me Walt—I like to hear from you often—Write to George
      tell him we sent his box and will send more

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00433_n100">1. After suffering from dizzy
      spells, Walt left Washington on June 22, 1864, for an extended period of
      recuperation at home. While the poet was in Brooklyn, his brother George was
      captured on September 30, 1864, at Poplar Grove, Virginia, sent to prisons in
      Salisbury, North Carolina, and Richmond, and eventually placed in a Confederate
      military prison at Danville, Virginia, about October 22 (Jerome M. Loving, ed.,
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em>
      [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975], 18). The four letters
      written after Walt's return to Washington on January 23, 1865, reveal how Jeff
      and Walt coordinated their efforts in sending food and clothing to George and
      attempting to secure his release.This was a period of great fear, anxiety,
      and frustration for the Whitman family. Daily they read lurid newspaper
      accounts of the barbarous conditions in Confederate prisons and hospitals,
      including several articles by an escaped prisoner of war, Albert D.
      Richardson. In public testimony before a congressional committee, Richardson
      charged "that the rebel authorities are murdering our soldiers at Salisbury
      by cold and hunger, while they might easily supply them with ample food and
      fuel" (<em>Brooklyn Daily Union</em>, January 31, 1865). He
      accused the Confederates of deliberate and systematic atrocities and
      estimated that prisoners "were dying at the average rate of twenty-eight per
      day, or thirteen per cent per month" (<em>Evening Post</em>,
      January 31, 1865). Such harrowing stories must have moved the Whitmans to
      despair of recovering George.<br><br>At the same time, the likelihood of a
      general prisoner exchange seemed ever more remote. Exchanges had seldom
      worked well in this war and had long been a subject of controversy among
      Union leaders. Grant had ordered all exchanges halted until the Confederates
      improved their treatment of black prisoners and released enough Union men to
      offset those Confederates who had been exchanged but had illegally returned
      to arms. Richardson's articles and former Brigadier General Benjamin
      Franklin Butler's speech of January 28, 1865, confirmed Jeff's fears that
      Grant did not want to exchange "good men for poor ones," and he somewhat
      pathetically asked Walt how Grant could be "willing to let the men starve
      and die without result" (see Jeff Whitman's letter to Walt from ). But Richardson claimed that
      such was the "cold-blooded" policy of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and
      that it had already cost the lives of ten thousand Union solders; and
      Butler, who had long advocated a more liberal exchange program, exculpated
      himself and placed responsibility squarely upon Grant.<br><br>While modern
      historians have rejected the notion that conditions in Confederate prison
      camps resulted from a willful and systematic policy, they have confirmed
      that Grant did halt prisoner exchanges in order to deprive the South of
      needed reinforcements. Only in late January 1865, when he realized the war
      was coming to an end, did Grant agree to a policy of even exchange. The
      uncertainties and tensions of these two weeks intensified Jeff's fears for
      George's health and safety and gave added cause for his skepticism of public
      officials.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00433_n2">2. Whitman's letter of
      about January 25 is not extant. This letter is not listed among the poet's lost
      letters (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:368).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00433_n4">4. On January 24, 1865,
      the <em>Evening Post</em> published on the front page Grant's
      letter of January 21 to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton stating that a limited
      exchange of prisoners was under way at Richmond and that a general exchange
      should soon follow. Grant added that supplies were being distributed to
      prisoners by Union agents. The <em>Post</em> also reprinted
      Stanton's letter to the House of Representatives which indicated that Grant had
      had authority to make such an exchange since October 15, 1864, and that now the
      exchange appeared unlikely.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00433_n5">5. Whitman was a
      first-class (lowest grade) clerk in the Indian Bureau, a branch of the
      Department of the Interior.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00433_n6">6. Of course Jeff refers
      not to his neighbor John Brown but to the abolitionist leader who had seized the
      U.S. arsenal at Harpers Ferry and been memorialized in a popular song, "John
      Brown had a little Indian."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00433_n7">7. Whitman responded on
      : "It is easy enough—I take
      things very easy—the rule is to come at 9 and go at 4—but I don't come at 9, and
      only stay till 4 when I want." The job was perfect for it allowed Whitman time
      for both his hospital visits and his literary pursuits.<a href="#r7">[back]
