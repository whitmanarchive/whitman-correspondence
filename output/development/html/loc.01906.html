   <p>Just now received the New York Commercial Advertiser, which was
      for some days ago preceded by your kind letter. When returned to Washington,
      Clausen, who has taken a strong and sincere attachment to
      you, most certainly will be willing to translate the whole article verbally to you.
      I should be glad if after a thorough knowledge you still would be pleased with it.
      I
      have had <u>very</u> great pleasure in introducing you to the
      Scandinavian public, and most probably in no European country you would find the
      [
      <span class="unclear">questions?</span>]
       of the mind so favourable  for the
      understanding of your poetry. Your books and portraits
      have in the last month circulated amongst the ladies of my acquaintance, for
      especially it is the women that are your friends. Bjornson writes
      of your article: "Walt Whitman makes me a joy as no new man in many years and in one
      respect the greatest I have ever had. Never had I thought in <u>my</u> days (during <u>my</u> life-time) to get a spirit
      (or ghost, none of the expressions signify exactly our stand) 
      (
      
      for my help—from America. But such and in no other shape of course it
      must come. I thank him and thee from my full heart. I went amazed during some days
      and still the great impressions are haunting me, as were I on the ocean looking on
      the driving  ice-bergs,
      that are inaugurating the spring."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am very curious to know how you did like Clemens Petersen. Of
      course you did <u>not</u> like him. But if you have not found him
      broken by sickness and bad humors you must have felt, that here is a mind with
      perhaps the finest nerves for beauty, you ever met.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Will you do me a service? I should like to write an article on "American fancy"
      
      comparating
      
       the grotesque humor that is scattered with no pretension in your
      newspapers with the humor of Luther and Shakespeare. Our own papers are some times
      bringing such specimens of wit and humour extracted from the American papers. Could
      you not find for me about a dozen  jokes of this sort. That is all I want. For instance: I saw in
      "Harpers Weekly" one of your leading political men (whom?) as
      Cincinnatus by the plough bringing <u>himself</u> an address, the
      same person making (in two figures) compliments to himself. Another instance: A
      teacher explains to his <u>children</u> pupils the meaning of a
      phenomenon. An apple tree is no phenomenon; a cow is none. But if you were seeing
      a
      cow in an apple tree plucking apples with his tail: <em>that</em>
      would be a phenomenon!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>At present you will understand my meaning! Good bye.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The Swede Peter Carl Rudolph
      Schmidt (1836–1899) was the editor of the idealist <em>For
         Idé og Virkelighed</em> ("For Idea and Reality") and had translated
      Whitman's <em>Democratic Vistas</em> into Danish in 1871 (see the
      letter from Schmidt to Whitman of ).
