      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter of Wednesday last all right. I shall begin to look for Jeff,<sup><a href="#nyp.00256_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> to-morrow—I do hope he will come.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just changed my quarters—I moved to-day back again to the same house Mrs. Grayson<sup><a href="#nyp.00256_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> used to live in—it is now occupied by a Mr. &amp; Mrs. Benedict—<sup><a href="#nyp.00256_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>I have not got my old-room but a room right over it—it is in the attic, it is true,
      but I think it will be pleasant, &amp; cool in summer—&amp; all the quieter for being in the
      attic—every thing is new &amp; clean, new bedstead, mattress, &amp;c—I can't tell till I try,
      but I think I shall like it—that is, as well as one is apt to like 
      any quarters here in Washington—I will write you how I like it in my next—I want Jeff
      to come &amp; stay there with me—it will be pleasant &amp; comfortable—it is 472 M st. 2d
      door west of 12th—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, it may be I write kind of sober sometimes, but I have been this winter, 
      &amp; am now, in as good health as usual, &amp; very good spirits—So, brother Jeff, I don't
      feel a bit "pegged out"—only getting old—most 50, you know—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have had another cold spell here, pretty nearly as cold as ever—There is great
      excitement in Congress—they have night sessions—<sup><a href="#nyp.00256_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I went to the hospital 
      
      Sunday afternoon last—there is a friend of mine there that got shot at Cold Harbor
      in June 1864—
      &amp; he has had the bullet in him ever since—it was in a very bad place, the lower part
      of the stomach, 
      just in the waist—last Saturday he had an operation &amp; had it extracted—it was in,
      the length of my little finger—it was a very critical operation indeed—but he got
      through with, &amp; is going to get well, according to all appearances now—There are lots
      of things left by the war, yet.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope Jeff will not disappoint me—the prospect, as I write, is for pleasant weather—&amp;
      Jeff can stop with me just as well as not—Love to George and Matty, &amp; all.
      
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00256_n1">1. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman (1833–1890), Walt's brother.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00256_n2">2. Juliet Grayson operated the
      boardinghouse at 468 M North, where Walt Whitman lived between late January 1865
      and February 1866. Whitman reported her death in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00256_n3">3. Newton Benedict. The 1869
      Directory listed him as a clerk in the State Department and Mrs. Benedict as a
      clerk in the First Comptroller's office. The 1869 annual report from the
      Commissioner of Patents recorded that a Newton Benedict received a patent for a
      "sliding clamp… forming, for the wick, a slitted cap or covering" on a
      lamp, as well as for the construction of the press-gauge for the wick.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00256_n4">4. A reconstruction bill
      under discussion aroused bitter controversy. The first Reconstruction Act was
      passed March 2, 1867.<a href="#r4">[back]
