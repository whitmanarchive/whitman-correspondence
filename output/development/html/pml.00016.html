      <br></br><br></br>Mrs. Price, &amp; all
      <br></br>My dear friends,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I sent you a telegram, ten minutes ago, telling you that I have just succeeded in
      getting an order from the Attorney General for Mr. Parker's pardon.<sup><a href="#pml.00016_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> The pardon will probably go from here, (from the State Department,) on Monday next—the
      day you will receive this note—it will be directed to the Jail at Plymouth. I have
      had much more of a struggle than I anticipated—the pardon clerk knew the case, &amp; was
      filled with Mr. Dana's<sup><a href="#pml.00016_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> reports upon it. When we meet, (or perhaps by letter, before) I will give you a more
      detailed account of the progress of the affair here, &amp; its fluctuations. But no matter—it
      has ended successfully.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have written to Aurelia Parker, &amp; sent the news, the same mail as this.</p>
   
   <p>I am fearfully well—indeed so red &amp; fat that people stop in the street &amp; gaze at me.</p>
   
   <p>In the office, &amp; my work, every thing goes on as usual. We are having delicious weather,
      coolish &amp; bright.
      Has Arthur<sup><a href="#pml.00016_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> gone, then? Well you will value him all the more, when you have him again.
   </p>
   
   <p>Helen &amp; Emmy,<sup><a href="#pml.00016_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> my dear friends, I send you my best love—Go over &amp; see my mother when you can—Best
      remembrance to Mr. Arnold<sup><a href="#pml.00016_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup>—also to Mr. Price.<sup><a href="#pml.00016_n8" id="r7">7</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Abby H. Price
      (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
      husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
      children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
      age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
      were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
      Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for
      the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother in <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 (1908): 163–169. In a letter to Ellen M.
      O'Connor from , Whitman declared
      with emphasis, "<em>they are all friends</em>, to prize and love
      deeply."

   <p id="pml.00016_n100">1. The envelope for this
      letter bears the address: To | Mrs. Abby H. Price, | 279 East 55th st. bet. 1st

   <p id="pml.00016_n3">2. The Prices became
      interested in the case of Erastus Otis Parker, as Helen Price wrote years later,
      "through his niece an intimate friend who beleived most absolutely in her
      Uncle's innocence" (Pierpont Morgan Library). They asked Whitman to investigate
      the circumstances of Parker's conviction and to appeal for a pardon. See
      Whitman's  letter to Henry
      Stanbery.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="pml.00016_n4">3. Richard Henry Dana, Jr.
      (1815–1882), author of <em>Two Years Before the Mast</em>,
      was the United States attorney for the district of Massachusetts from 1861 to
      1866. On July 9, 1864, Dana informed Montgomery Blair, Postmaster General, that
      a pardon was being requested for Parker "on the ground of failing health." On
      March 19, 1866, in a letter to M. F. Pleasants, pardon clerk in Whitman's office
      (see Whitman's letter from 
      , Dana explained what
      had transpired two years earlier: "Parker's friends tried to get President
      Lincoln to issue a pardon without its coming to his knowledge that Parker had
      admitted his guilt; and for that purpose, contrived to get the thing out of the
      regular track of the Pardon Bureau, with a report from me. I think they did get
      an order for a pardon, conditioned on Mr. Blair's assent. But, Mr. Blair sent
      the papers to me; and when the President learned the facts, and the deception
      that had been practiced upon him, he revoked the order. . . . The case is a very
      bad one, almost as bad in the fraudulent attempts to get signatures and a
      pardon, as in the original guilt" (National Archives).<a href="#r3">[back]

      his daughter's family in the same house as the Abby and Edmund Price family.
      Helen Price, Abby's daughter, described Arnold as "a Swedenborgian," with whom
      Whitman frequently argued without "the slightest irritation between them"
      (Richard Maurice Bucke, <em>Walt Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1883], 26–27).<a href="#r6">[back]
