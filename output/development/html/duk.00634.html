   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00634_n1">1. This letter dates to between
      January 3 and January 24, 1871. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter January
      10, 1871, which fell on a Tuesday. Edwin Haviland Miller dated no letter to
      January 1871 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:368). Bucke's date cannot be
      confirmed, but many contextual clues suggest it is possible: Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman asked Walt whether he would visit in February. The son of Louisa's
      former neighbor Margret Steers had lost a position with the Brooklyn Water
      Board, and Louisa says Steers's son was discharged "with many others." That
      remark is consistent with mass layoffs at the Brooklyn Water Works in late 1870
      and early 1871. Also, Louisa did not know when her daughter-in-law Martha
      Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman would visit. Though the exact date of Mattie's arrival
      in Brooklyn is not known, Louisa began to expect her in early
      February—though her arrival was delayed until late February. Because
      Brooklyn Water Works employee layoffs were widely reported in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> in December and because the expected
      visits of Mattie and of Walt are discussed as if some distance in the future,
      January 10, 1871 is a probable date. However, no evidence in the letter provides
      exact confirmation. Therefore, the letter is assigned a range of dates that is
      consistent with its subjects, to Tuesdays from January 3 to January 24,
      1871.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00634_n17">3. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman had mentioned briefly the property that George Washington Whitman
      intended to sell (and now had sold) to Margret Steers more than a year
      earlier (see Louisa's  letter to
      Walt Whitman).<br><br>
      Louisa had known the Steers family about three years. Margret and husband
      Thomas Steers (1826–1869) and their four children Thomas (b. 1853),
      Caroline (b. 1857), Louisa (b. 1862), and Margret (b. 1865) moved into the
      Atlantic Avenue building in which Louisa was boarding in November 1868.
      Thomas Steers operated a bakery, and his wife, who would become a close
      friend of Louisa, continued the business when he died in January 1869. After
      Thomas Steers's sudden death, Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman replied to a
      non-extant early 1869 letter from Louisa with concern that "Mr. Steers'
      death had quite an effect on you" (see Mattie's February? 1869 letter to
      Louisa in Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of
         Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1977], 67; Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt; "Died," <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Eagle</em>, January 22, 1869, 3; and <em>United States
         Census, 1870</em>, New York, Brooklyn Ward 7, Kings).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00634_n2">4. The <em>Brooklyn Directory</em> (1871) lists two Lotts as lawyers, Abraham and John
      Z., at 13 Willoughby Street. A man named Lott is mentioned previously on matters
      concerning George Washington Whitman's speculative housebuilding business (see
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter
      to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00634_n7">5. The <em>Brooklyn Directory</em> (1871) lists two Greenwoods as lawyers, John and
      Joseph, at Montague and Remsen Streets. Another Greenwood, John E., is listed as
      an agent and located at Halsey and Tompkins Avenue.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00634_n4">6. The son of Margret Steers is
      named Thomas, and he is presumably a laborer or inspector who has lost his
      position for the Brooklyn Water Works during its mass layoffs.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00634_n5">7. William A. Fowler, President
      of the Brooklyn Water Board, began discharging employees with mass layoffs in
      November 1870 and anticipated continuing a series of employee purges: 100 on
      November 1, 150 on November 15, 200 on December 1, and more in January ("Two
      Hundred Men Discharged To-Day," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>,
      December 2, 1870, 4). Brooklyn Mayor Martin Kalbleisch blamed the proliferation
      of community boards, including the Water Board, whose street improvements
      included paving and lighting, for extravagant expenditures ("The Mayor's
      Message," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, January 4, 1871, 2). The
      newspaper, though careful to express some sympathy for released workers, lauded
      the new emphasis on discharging employees and the promise of reduced property
      taxes ("The Eagle and Local Taxation. What is Said of its Course. Leading Men of
      All Parties Stand by the Eagle," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>,
      December 2, 1870, 2).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00634_n6">8. Walt Whitman's visit,
      planned for February (according to this letter), is difficult to date precisely.
      However, he may have made a brief visit in late February, March, or April near
      the marriage of George Washington Whitman to Louisa Orr Haslam. The family of
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman also visited. Walt took his summer vacation in June
      (see Walt's  letter to Peter
      Doyle).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n4">9. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00634_n8">10. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. No letter from Jeff or Mattie from this period,
      December 1870 to February 1871, is extant. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman probably
      expected Mattie to report her plans for a visit that was anticipated to begin in
      early February but was delayed (see Louisa's  letter to Walt). Mattie and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat ailment that led to her death in
      February 1873. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York:
      New York University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r10">[back]
