      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Tennyson,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>After a long absence in the mountains &amp; lakes of Vermont &amp; northern New York, I am
      
      now back again at work, &amp; expect to remain here. Your letter of May 23d, also the
      
      one with the picture, safely reached me.<sup><a href="#prc.00028_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> The picture is superb, &amp; I consider myself 
      in luck, possessing it. It brings you very near me. I have it now before me.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you, by same mail with this, in a little book, my piece lately delivered for
      
      Dartmouth College commencement, up north. Did <em>Democratic Vistas</em> reach you?<sup><a href="#prc.00028_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have had, in this country, a summer more fit for the infernal regionsâ€”but now the
      
      delicious Virginia September has set in, balmy cool, &amp; one dilates &amp; feels like work
      again.
      
   </p>

      With best respects &amp; love,
      <br></br>Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>My address continues the same, <em>Solicitor's Office Treasury, Washington, D.C.</em>

         Vistas</em> on . <br><br>
      Edwin Haviland Miller's publication of this letter carried the following
      acknowledgments: "I am able to print this previously unknown letter through
      the courtesy of Lord Tennyson and Sir Charles Tennyson. Dr. Edgar F.
      Shannon, Jr., president of the University of Virginia, who is preparing an
      edition of Tennyson's letters, has graciously consented to my publication of
      the correspondence between the two poets. I wish also to thank the City of
      Lincoln (England) Public Libraries, Museum, and Art Gallery for the
