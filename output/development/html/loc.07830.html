   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4102">2. John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,

   <p id="n0262">3. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <p id="n0129">4. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="loc.07830_n2">5. Burroughs commented on
      Dr. Johnston's visit in his journal on July 24: "A canny young Scot. Like him
      first rate" (see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [1931], 292).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.07830_n4">7. John Addington Symonds, <em>Essays Speculative and Suggestive</em> (London: Chapman and
      Hall, 1890). The chapter on "Democratic Art" is mainly inspired by Whitman. In
      his  letter, Bucke remarked: "The
      whole article is 'flat, stale and unprofitable'—a saw dust chewing
      business—dealing with the hull, the shell, the superfices, never for one
      line, one flash of insight penetrating to the heart of the business." On , Whitman observed: "you are a little more
      severe on Symonds than I sh'd be."<a href="#r7">[back]

      "Rejoinder" was later reprinted in <em>Good-Bye My Fancy</em>
      (1891) (see <em>Prose Works</em> 2: 655-658). Bucke acknowledged
      receiving it on .<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="n3024">9. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.
      (1809–1894) was a Bostonian author, physician, and lecturer. One of the
      Fireside Poets, he was a good friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson as well as John
      Burroughs. Towards Whitman's poetry, Holmes remained ambivalent. He married
      Amelia Lee Jackson in 1840 and they had three children, including the later
      Supreme Court judge Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. For more information, see

      to all intents and purposes an Englishman (and a very good speciment too) Such a
      book as L. of G. and the mentality that goes with such a book is as far as
      possible from his ideal."<a href="#r10">[back]
