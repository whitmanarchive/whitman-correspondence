   <p>Your letter of Sunday has come,<sup><a href="#duk.00831_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; I am glad to get those impromptu well filled
      yellow sheets—<em>write again</em>—I have not heard any
      more from O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup>—when I do I will tell you—I write or send papers or
      something every day<sup><a href="#duk.00833_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Have just had my
      dinner—a great piece of toasted Graham bread salted &amp; well buttered with
      fresh country butter, &amp; then a lot of good panned oysters dumped over it, with
      the hot broth—then a nice cup custard &amp; a cup of coffee—So if you
      see in the paper that I am <em>starving</em> (as I saw it the other
      day) understand how—I enclose Rhys's<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> letter rec'd this morning<sup><a href="#duk.00833_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup>—As I understand it, Wilson is no more in the
      W[ilson] &amp; McC[ormick] partnership, Glasgow, but sets up by himself—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.)

      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
