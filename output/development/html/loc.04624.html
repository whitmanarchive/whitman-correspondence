      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Have you any other volume published besides "Leaves of Grass" and "Specimen Days
      &amp; Collect"? I have these two, and have been
      acquainted with your writings for some time, 
      altho
      
       but a young man as yet. I will be glad to procure any other volume you may
      have. I have seen in some public library (I think at Minneapolis and Cincinnati) a
      volume of biography, 
      altho
      
       it seems to me now there were two different ones. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I would be pleased also to have a large picture of yourself, if any has ever been
      published. A cabinet photograph, at any rate. I will remit you whatever these may
      be
      worth. I understand you have no publisher now, 
      altho
      
       "David McKay Phila." appears on the title page of your books—
   </p>
