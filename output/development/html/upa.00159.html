      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received your letter of Saturday 25th this morning, 
      &amp; glad to hear from you indeed—I suppose by this time you have rec'd the letter 
      I sent yesterday 27th<sup><a href="#upa.00159_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I sent you the Galaxy, but I see by your letter 
      that George had already bought one. I have seen the piece in Thursday's Times<sup><a href="#upa.00159_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—John Swinton sent me one—so you can enclose it to Jeff—I have just received 
      a letter from England, enclosing other notices, &amp;c.—Mr. Conway is very friendly—but
      my friend Col. Hinton,<sup><a href="#upa.00159_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> (in his letter some weeks ago in the Rochester Express,) 
      has given him, Conway, some pretty sharp cuts about his ridiculous anecdotes of me
      
      &amp; you too<sup><a href="#upa.00159_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Still Conway seems to mean all the good he can. But such descriptions 
      of me as, "<em>he was never known to smile or laugh</em>," is altogether too jolly—dont you think so?
      
   </p>
   
   <br><br><span class="dateline">Thursday evening 8 o'clock</span>
   
   
   <p>Well, mother, I will again write a few lines—I have been out most 
      all the afternoon—went up first to the Impeachment trial, &amp; heard Mr. Evarts<sup><a href="#upa.00159_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> 
      speak a while, &amp; then left, for it seemed too pleasant outdoors to stay in there—I
      took a long walk, &amp; ride in the cars away out in the suburbs, 
      &amp; so back to dinner, &amp; now this evening another walk—&amp; have fetched in 
      here at the office, to sit awhile, read the paper &amp;c.—I received to-day 
      another letter from old Mr. Alcott<sup><a href="#upa.00159_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—I sent him the Galaxy with "Personalism"—&amp; he compliments me highly, &amp; speaks of
      Mr. Emerson too &amp; his friendliness to me—We have had a warm but very pleasant day—I
      am feeling very well—I only hope, dear mother, you are feeling well &amp; in good spirits.
      
   </p>
   
   <br><br><span class="dateline">Friday evening, May 1.</span>
   
   
   <p>Mother, your letter of Wednesday, 29th, came this forenoon—it was too bad 
      you didn't get mine Tuesday, as I put it in the P. O. myself Monday—So you are not
      going to move at present—I too remain in the same place, 
      but have been going to move all winter &amp; the spring too—I have been in the office
      
      all day to-day—all the rest of the clerks wanted to go up to the 
      Impeachment trial, but I didn't care to go.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received another paper from England to-day, with a tremendous big favorable
      notice 
      of my book, between three &amp; four columns, one of the friendliest notices yet written.<sup><a href="#upa.00159_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> 
      The English publisher of my book, Mr Hotten, sends them to me—
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>Saturday, noon</em>—I am going off for the afternoon—Mr. Stanbery<sup><a href="#upa.00159_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> is to speak on the trial, &amp; I may go in &amp; hear him a few minutes, 
      but I guess I shall spend my half-holiday mostly in jaunting around in the open air.
      
      Every thing begins to look like summer here—the trees are all green—we are having
      it pretty warm to-day, but a little hazy—it is now 12 o'clock—the noon-bell has just
      rung, &amp; I am off for the rest of the day—Take good care of yourself, dear mother—
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>Sunday afternoon</em>—Mother, you see I am determined to make you out a letter—I have been sitting here
      in the office all alone, fixing up my new piece<sup><a href="#upa.00159_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> 
      for the Galaxy—for I have still another piece, besides those that have already appeared—Two
      have appeared, &amp; now this is the third one, addressed to the literary classes—I want
      the Galaxy folks to print it in the July number, but they havn't sent me word yet
      
      whether they will or no. It is a pleasant day—we have had quite a rain storm 
      yesterday afternoon &amp; last night—I am going out at 6 o'clock to 
      O'Connors to tea—Mother, I hope you are having a pleasant Sunday.
      
   </p>
   
   <br><br><span class="dateline"><em>Monday forenoon, May 4</em>.
      </span>
   
   
   <p>Well, I had a quiet, agreeable sort of Sunday—wrote &amp; read most of the forenoon, 
      &amp; rambled out in the afternoon—&amp; went up to O'Connor's in the evening—he had two or
      three others there, visitors—O'Connors &amp; Burroughs's are very hospitable to me, 
      the same as they always have been—they are almost the only places I go—I send you
      a couple of papers same mail with this—I am going to send the MS 
      of my piece to the Galaxy to-day, as I have just rec'd a note from them by mail this
      morning<sup><a href="#upa.00159_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup>
      —I suppose George is well, &amp; busy—I should like to see you all. 
      Love to you, dearest mother—I will write again next Monday.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00159_n1">1. This letter is apparently
      not extant.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00159_n2">2. On April 23, 1868,
      "Monadnock" reported under "Affairs in England": "Of course you know that
      English and French critics admit but one American Poet. Bryant, Longfellow and
      the rest are only second and third rate English poets—the one American
      poet is Walt Whitman." The journalist quoted generously from the review of
      William Michael Rossetti's edition in the <em>Leader</em> by
      Edmund Yates (for Yates, see Walt Whitman's  letter). In a dispatch "From Great Britain" in the New York <em>Tribune</em> on May 9, 1868, G. W. Smalley commented hostilely
      on the favorable review of Walt Whitman in the <em>Athenaeum</em>,
      and concluded: "Mr. Carlyle likens [Walt Whitman] to a buffalo, useful in
      fertilizing the soil, but mistaken in supposing that his contributions of that
      sort are matters which the world desires to contemplate closely." On May 20,
      1868, O'Connor wrote to Rossetti to inquire about the authenticity of Carlyle's
      remarks; see William Michael Rossetti, <em>Rossetti Papers</em>
      (New York: Charles Scribners Sons, 1903), 355–356.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00159_n3">3. Richard J. Hinton
      (1830–1901) was born in London and came to the U.S. in 1851. He trained as
      a printer, and, like James Redpath (with whom Walt Whitman corresponded on ), went to Kansas and joined John
      Brown. In fact, but for an accident he would have been with Brown at Harper's
      Ferry. A man mistaken for Hinton was hanged. With Redpath, Hinton was the author
      of <em>Hand-book to Kansas Territory and the Rocky Mountains' Gold
         Region</em> (1859). Later he wrote <em>Rebel Invasion of
         Missouri and Kansas</em> (1865) and <em>John Brown and His
         Men</em> (1894). Apparently Hinton had suggested that Thayer and Eldridge
      print <em>Leaves of Grass</em>; see <em>The New
         Voice</em>, 16 (4 February 1899), 2. Hinton served in the Union Army from
      1861 to 1865, and saw Whitman while lying wounded in a hospital, a scene which
      he described in the Cincinnati <em>Commercial</em> on August 26,
      1871. After the war Hinton wrote for many newspapers. He defended O'Connor's <em>The Good Gray Poet</em> in the Milwaukee <em>Sentinel</em> on February 9, 1866. Hinton's article in the Rochester <em>Evening Express</em> on March 7, 1868, was a lengthy account
      of Walt Whitman's "Fame and Fortunes in England and America," with quotations
      from O'Connor and Burroughs. Obviously pleased, Walt Whitman sent it to friends,
      including Rossetti, who acknowledged it on . See Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.76.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> (1906–1996), 2:396;
      William Sloane Kennedy, <em>The Fight of a Book for the World</em>
      (West Yarmouth, Massachusetts: Stonecroft Press, 1926), 19, 67, 110–111,
      242; the Boston <em>Transcript</em>, December 21, 1901.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00159_n4">4. Walt Whitman's friends
      could not forgive Conway the anecdotes he had related in his article in the <em>Fortnightly Review</em>; Whitman himself referred to Conway's
      article as "most ridiculous" in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00159_n5">5. William Maxwell Evarts
      (1818–1901) was chief counsel for Andrew Johnson during the impeachment
      trial. When Walt Whitman heard him, Evarts had just presented the opening
      arguments for the defense. As a reward for his services, Johnson appointed
      Evarts Attorney General later in the year; Whitman reported the news in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      Evarts was Secretary of State from 1877 to 1881 and U.S. Senator from New York
      from 1885 to 1891.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00159_n6">6. On  Louisa Van Velsor Whitman replied:
      "poor old 
      alcot
      
       he must be very old seems to me (you remember walt that sunday morning
      we 
      couldent
      
       have him)."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00159_n7">7. On April 21, 1868, John
      Camden Hotten informed Rossetti that he had just sent Walt Whitman "a most
      flattering review" by Charles Kent, the editor of <em>The Sun</em>
      (William Michael Rossetti, <em>Rossetti Papers</em> [New York:
      Charles Scribners Sons, 1903], 351).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00159_n8">8. According to the
      Washington <em>Daily Morning Chronicle</em>, Stanbery began his
      defense of Johnson on May 1 and concluded his address on May 2.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00159_n9">9. The article, "Orbic
      Literature," was solicited in Walt Whitman's  letter to William Conant Church and Francis Pharcellus Church but
      was not picked up for publication in the <em>Galaxy</em>.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00159_n10">10. On , Francis P. Church advised that Walt
      Whitman's manuscript would have to be received by the end of the following week
      if the article were to appear in the July issue.<a href="#r10">[back]
