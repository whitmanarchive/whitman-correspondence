   <p>I have to beg pardon for a sad mistake &amp; piece of remissness—It seems that after
      I had put up "Pompeii" for return to you—it was taken away to his residence, by one
      of
      our <em>bosses</em>—in whose parlor I discovered it, a day or two
      since—&amp; of course have seized upon, and send it back to you after a long absence,
      &amp; I fear badly worn.
