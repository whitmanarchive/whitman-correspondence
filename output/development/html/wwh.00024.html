   <p>Just as I get ready to write you a line, Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> calls
      me to dinner—So as that is important, I will put down the lap tablet on which
      I am writing—&amp; finish afterwards—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well I had my dinner, cold meat, hot potatoes, nice stew'd tomatoes &amp; onions,
      &amp; a cup of tea &amp; Graham bread—enjoyed all—Am feeling pretty well
      these times—a couple of Wilson Barrett's<sup><a href="#loc.01370_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> actors
      came over in a carriage yesterday afternoon &amp; took me to the theatre to see
      "Clito"<sup><a href="#wwh.00024_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>—had a good afternoon ride &amp;
      performance—was used tip top—Mrs Davis went with me—got back here
      ab't sunset thro' a snow storm—My friend Wm O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r4">4</a></sup> is
      in a very bad way—locomotor ataxia—he is now in Los Angeles County
      California—
   </p>
   
   <p>It looks like winter out as I write, all white with snow—I havn't heard just
      lately from George<sup><a href="#n0700" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; Lou<sup><a href="#n0368" id="r6">6</a></sup> or Ed<sup><a href="#n1047" id="r7">7</a></sup>—but I am sure they are all right—Love to you, Jessie dear—

   <p id="loc.01370_n2">2. Wilson Barrett
      (1846–1904) was a British actor and playwright who was then performing in
      the United States. He played the lead role in <em>Clito</em>, a
      new blank-verse drama set in ancient Greece, written by the English dramatist
      Sydney Grundy (1848–1914) in collaboration with Barrett. Whitman was
      apparently quite taken with Barrett's acting and even met with him several times
      in early 1887.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="wwh.00024_n1">3. Barrett and Mary Eastlake

   <p id="n2002">4. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n0700">5. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0368">6. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

         </a></p>
   <p id="n1047">7. Edward Whitman (1835–1892),
      called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for significant physical and
      mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his mother until her death.
      George Whitman and his wife Louisa Orr Haslam cared for Eddy after Louisa's
      death, with financial support from Walt Whitman. For more information on Edward,
