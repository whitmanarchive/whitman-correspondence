   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07701_n2">2. On , Sir Edwin Arnold
      (1832–1904) wrote from Washington, D. C. requesting permission to visit
      Whitman. (The Boston <em>Traveller</em> on October 5, 1889,
      however reprinted a purported letter from Arnold to Whitman dated September 12,
      written from New York, in a flamboyant style not found in the actual letter.)
      For an account of Arnold's visit, see Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.157.html">Thursday, September 12, 1889 </a>and <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.157.html">Saturday, September 14, 1889</a>: "My main objection to him, if objection
      at all, would be, that he is too eulogistic—too flattering." Arnold
      published his own version of the interview in <em>Seas and
         Lands</em> (1891), in which he averred that the two read from <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, surrounded by Mrs. Davis, knitting, a
      handsome young man (Wilkins), and "a big setter." There are at least two
      additional accounts of Arnold's visit with Whitman; "Arnold and Whitman" was
      published anonymously in <em>The Times</em> (Philadelphia, PA) on
      <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00519.html">September 15, 1889</a> and a different article, also titled "Arnold and
      Whitman" was published anonymously in <em>The Daily Picayune</em>
      (New Orleans, LA) on <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00637.html">September 26, 1889</a>. Arnold was best known for his long narrative poem, 
      <em>The Light of Asia</em> (1879), which tells the life story and philosophy of Gautama Buddha and was largely
      
      responsible for introducing Buddhism to Western audiences.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07701_n3">3. The actor, Whitman
      informed Traubel, was "a hearty fellow, too—Hanson, I think was his name"
      (Horace Traubel <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.158.html">Friday, September 13, 1889</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03012_n1">4. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy of .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">5. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07701_n5">6. <em>The Bohemian Girl</em> (1843) was a ballad opera by 
      Irish composer Michael William Balfe (1808–1870) that enjoyed many revivals in Europe
      and the U.S. during the nineteenth century.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">7. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">8. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
