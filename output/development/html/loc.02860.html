      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you photographs of my eldest and youngest children I wish I had some worth
      sending of the other two. That of myself done in 1850 is a copy of a daguerrotype.
      The recent one was taken just a week or so before I broke down in my long illness
      &amp; when I was struggling against a terrible sense of inward prostration, so it
      has not my natural expression, but I think you will like to have it rather than
      none, &amp; the weather here is too gloomy for there to be any chance of a good one
      if I were to try again—Your few words lifted a heavy weight off me. Very few
      they are, dear friend: but knowing that I may give to every word you speak its
      fullest truest 
      meaning, the more I brood over them the sweeter do they taste. Still I am not as
      happy &amp; content as I thought I should be if I could only know my words reached
      you &amp; were welcome to you,—but restless, anxious, impatient, looking so
      wistfully towards the letters each morning—above [illegible] to come—to come &amp; see if you feel happy beside me:
      no more this painful struggle to put myself into words, but to let what I am &amp;
      all my life speak to you. Only so can you judge whether I am indeed the woman
      [
      <span class="unclear">capable of rising to
         the full</span>]
       height of great destiny, of justifying &amp; fulfilling your
      grand [
      <span class="unclear">thoughts of
         women.</span>]
       And see [
      <span class="unclear">my faults, flaws, shortcomings too, dear Friend. I
         feel</span>]
      
       an earnest wish you
      should do this so that there may be the broad unmovable foundation-rock of perfect
      truth &amp; candour for our love. I do not fear.—I believe in a large all
      accepting because all comprehending love, a boundless faith in growth &amp;
      developmenet—in your judging "not as the judge judges but as the sunshine
      falling around me."—To have you in the midst of us! we clustered round you,
      shone upon, vivified, strengthened by your presence—surrounding you with an
      atmosphere of love &amp; cheerful life. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When I wrote you in Nov. I was in lodging in London, having just accomplished the
      difficult task of finding a  house for us in London, where rents are so [
      <span class="unclear">high. And I have</span>]
      
      succeeded better than [
      <span class="unclear">I
         anticipated,</span>]
       for we find this a comfortable dear little
      home—small indeed but not so small as to interfere with health or comfort, and
      at rent that I may safely undertake. My Husband was taken from us
      too young to be able to[
      <span class="unclear">
         have made any provision for his children. I have a little of my
         own—about</span>]
      &gt; £80 a year; &amp; for the rest depend upon my
      Mother whose only surviving child I am. And she by nature generous &amp;
      self-denying as well [
      <span class="unclear">as
         prudent, has never made</span>]
       anything but a pleasure of this &amp; as long
      as she was able to see to her own affairs, was such a capital manager that she used
      to spare me about £150 out of an income of £350. But now though she
      retains her faculties in a wonderful degree for her years (just upon 86), she is no
      longer able  to do this
      &amp; has put the management of the whole into my hands. And I, feeling that she
      needs and ought to have now an easier scale of expenditure at Colne, have to manage
      a little more cleverly still to make a less sum serve for us. But I succeed
      capitally dear friend—do not want a better home, never get behind hand &amp;
      find it no hardship, but quite the contrary to have to spend a good [
      <span class="unclear">deal of time &amp; pains in
         domestic</span>]
       management. And then, just to help me through at the right
      moment dear Per obtained in November a good
      opening in some large copper &amp; iron mining &amp; smelting works in South Wales
      at a salary upon which he can comfortably live  &amp; he likes his work
      well—writes very cheerfully—lodges in a farm house in the midst of grand
      scenery, within a walk of the sea. So this enables me to give the girls a turn in
      education, for hitherto they have had hardly any teaching but mine. And I chose this
      part because there is a capital day school for them handy. And Herby walks in to the best drawing [illegible]
      
      &amp; is very diligent &amp; happy at his work. His bent is so unmistakably strong.
      It was well I have had to be so busy this autumn &amp; winter, dear Walt, for I
      suffered keenly, sometimes overwhelmingly, through the delay in my letters' reaching
      you. What caused it? And when did you get the Sep. &amp; Oct. letter &amp; did you
      get the two copies that I, baffled &amp; almost despairing, sent off in Nov.?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
