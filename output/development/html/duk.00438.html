   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00438_n10">1. This letter dates to August
      8, 1865. The date "August 8" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard
      Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1865 to the letter, and Edwin Haviland Miller
      agreed with Bucke's date (<em>The Correspondence,
         1842–67</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:376). The year can be confirmed based on Louisa's many references to her son
      George Washington Whitman: her admiration for his uniform in preparation for a
      military review, his need to "settle up" his pay at the conclusion of his
      service, and his possible plans to seek "journey work" (day labor). It is
      consistent also with Thomas Jefferson Whitman's recommendation that George start
      up his own business.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n1">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years
      Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until
      the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg
      (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove
      (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Smith and later a mason named French. George
      also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. George
      struggled initially to find employment after the war. He ate meals with Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman and his brother Edward at the Portland Avenue house in
      Brooklyn but boarded in a rented room. For more information on George Washington
      Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>" and Jerome M. Loving, ed.,"<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham: Duke University Press, 1975),
      26–28.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n8">3. Hart Island, or Hart's
      Island, located near the western end of Long Island, served as a military depot
      and training center for new recruits into the Union army. It also served as a
      Confederate prisoner-of-war camp.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n2">4. Since this letter dates to
      August 8, 1865, a Tuesday, the phrase "here last sunday week" indicates that the
      soldier Frederick B. McReady visited for tea on July 30. McReady served with
      George Washington Whitman in the Fifty-first New York Volunteers, and he rose to
      the rank of captain. Walt Whitman encountered McReady at Fredricksburg,
      Virginia. See George's  letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walt's 
      letter to Louisa.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n13">5. When George Washington
      Whitman arrived home to Brooklyn for a 30-day leave after his release from the
      Confederate prison camp at Andersonville, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote that
      he "looks quite thin and shows his prison life"(see her  letter to Walt).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n14">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. At the time of this
      letter, Jeff was employed as a civil engineer at the Brooklyn Water Works, and
      in 1867 he moved to St. Louis to become Superintendent of Water Works, where he
      become a nationally recognized name. Jeff encouraged his brother George
      Washington Whitman to pursue an independent business in building houses on
      speculation, and through his connection to Moses Lane, his supervisor at the
      Brooklyn Water Works, Jeff found George an offer of employment (see Jeff's  letter to Walt). For more on
      Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n3">7. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman. Their
      elder daughter Manahatta (1860–1886), nicknamed "Hattie," also attended
      George's military review; Jessie Louisa "Sis" (1863–1957) presumably
      remained at home. For more on Mattie, see the introduction to Randall H.
      Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n4">8. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n15">9. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      visited daughter Hannah (Whitman) Heyde in early September 1865. She provided an
      extended description of Charles and Hannah's home in her  letter to Walt.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n11">10. To doff is to remove
      clothing. George soon would muster out of the Union Army, set aside his military
      uniform, and purchase civilian clothes.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n16">11. According to the National
      Park Service Soldiers and Sailors Database, George Washington Whitman's
      regiment, the 51st New York, "lost during service 9 Officers and 193 Enlisted
      men killed and mortally wounded and 2 Officers and 174 Enlisted men by
      disease."<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n5">12. Julius W. Mason
      (1835–1882) was a lieutenant colonel in the Fifth Cavalry. Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman mentioned a J. W. Mason who "used to be in my party on the
      Water Works" in his  to Walt
      Whitman. Mason became a career army officer, and he assisted in getting supplies
      to George when he was held prisoner. Mason remained in the army until dying of
      apoplexy in 1882. His father George F. Mason was a prominent Pennsylvania
      businessman and state senator, with whom Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman stayed
      after selling her furniture in preparation for departure to St. Louis. See Jeff
      Whitman's  and  letters to Walt, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's  letter to Walt, and Randall
      H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977), 37.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n6">13. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. He later
      designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city
      engineer. He was instrumental in promoting Thomas Jefferson Whitman's career and
      employed George Washington Whitman as a pipe inspector after the war. See Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman's  letter to
      Walt Whitman. For Lane's career, see "Moses Lane," <em>Proceedings
         of the American Society of Civil Engineers</em> (February 1882), 58.<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00437_n13">14. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Thomas Jefferson Whitman and his wife. Late in life, Ruggles
      lost interest in his practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures
      called "Ruggles Gems."<a href="#r14">[back]
