   <p>Lewy, your letter of August 10 came safe, &amp; was glad to hear all about you, &amp; the
      way you are spending the time—Lew, you must be having first rate times out there—well
      you need something to make up what you have suffered—You speak of being used well
      out there—Lewy, I feel as if I could love any one that uses you well, &amp; does you a
      kindness—but what kind of heart must that man have that would treat otherwise, or
      say any thing insulting, to a crippled young soldier, hurt in fighting for this union
      &amp; flag? (Well I should say damned little man or heart in the business)—
   </p>
   
   <p>Should you meet any such, you must not mind them, dear comrade, &amp; not allow your feelings
      to be hurt by such loafers—(I agree with you that a rebel in the southern army is
      much more respectable than a northern copperhead.) Dear son, when I read about your agreeable visit of a week, &amp; how much you enjoyed
      yourself, I felt as much gratified as though I had enjoyed it myself—&amp; I was truly
      thankful to hear that your leg is still doing well, &amp; on the gain—you must not mind
      its being slowly, dear son, if it only goes forward instead of backward, &amp; you must
      try to be very careful of your eating &amp; drinking &amp;c., not indulge in any excesses,
      &amp; not eat too much flummery, but generally plain food, for that is always best, &amp;
      it helps along so much.
   </p> 
   
   <p>Lewy, I believe I wrote you an acc't of the presentation to Dr Bliss—he is now off
      north for three weeks—Dr Butler<sup><a href="#loc.00888_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> (ward D) is in charge—some of the doctors &amp; wardmasters have been drafted—poor Johnny
      Mahay<sup><a href="#loc.00888_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> is not in very good spirits—he was to have an operation performed before Bliss went,
      but he went off &amp; did not do it—Johnny is pretty low some days—Things in ward K are pretty much the same—they had some improvem'ts in the Hospital,
      new sinks, much better, &amp; the grounds in front &amp; between the wards nicely laid out
      in flowers &amp; grass plots &amp;c.—but, Lew, it has been awful hot in the wards the past
      two weeks, the roofs burnt like fire—
   </p>
   
   <p>There is no particular war news—they are having batches of conscripts now every day
      in the Army—Meade is down on the upper Rappahannock &amp; fords, &amp; around Warrenton—Lee
      stretches down toward Gordonsville, they say his head quarters is there—folks are
      all looking toward Charleston—if we could only succeed there, I don't know what secesh
      would do—the ground seems to be slipping more &amp; more from under their feet—Lew, the
      <em>Union</em> &amp; the <em>American Flag</em> must conquer, it is destiny—it may be long, or it may be short, but that will be
      the result—but O what precious lives have been lost by tens of thousands in the struggle
      already—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Lew, you speak in your letter how you would like to see me—well, my darling, I wonder
      if there is not somebody who would be gratified to see you, &amp; always will be wherever
      he is—Dear comrade, I was highly pleased at your telling me in your letter about your
      folks' place, the house &amp; land &amp; all the items—you say I must excuse you for writing
      so much foolishness—nothing of the kind—My darling boy, when you write to me, you
      must write without ceremony, I like to hear every little thing about yourself &amp; your
      affairs—you need never care how you write to me, Lewy, if you will only—I never think
      about literary perfection in letters either, it is the <em>man</em> &amp; the <em>feeling</em>—Lewy, I am feeling pretty well, but the sun affects me a little, aching &amp; fulness
      in the head—a good many have been sun-struck here the last two weeks—I keep shady
      through the middle of the day lately—Well, my dear boy, I have scribbled away any
      thing, for I wanted to write you to-day &amp; now I must switch off—good by, my darling
      comrade, for the present, &amp; I pray God to bless you now &amp; always.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Lewis Kirke Brown (1843–1926) was
      wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on August 19, 1862, and lay
      where he fell for four days. Eventually he was transferred to Armory Square
      Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in February 1863. In a diary in the
      Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on February 19, 1863, as "a most
      affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come and sit by him." Because the
      wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on January 5, 1864. Whitman was
      present and described the operation in a diary (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection
      of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out
      in August 1864, and was employed in the Provost General's office in September;
      see Whitman's 
      . The following
      September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief
      of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until his retirement
      in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was prepared by Brown's
      family and is now held in the Library of Congress.) Brown had written from
      Judiciary Square Hospital on , and
