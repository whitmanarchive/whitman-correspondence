   <p>Thanks best thanks, dear Mr Bennett &amp; dear Mr Chambers &amp; all you dear <em>Herald</em> boys—but
      have not sent you a line for a month—&amp; probably will not any
      more—as I am ill from breaking out of old war-paralysis—I return the
      check &amp; take my name from the roll.
   </p>
   
   <p>Again best respects to Mr B &amp; all of you—</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Gordon Bennett Jr.
      (1841–1918) was the editor and publisher of the <em>New York
         Herald</em>, founded by his father in 1835. Julius Chambers
      (1850–1920) was an American author, investigative journalist, and travel
      writer; after working as a reporter for the <em>New York
         Tribune</em>, he became an editor of the <em>New York
         Herald</em> and, later, managing editor of the <em>New York
         World</em>. For more on the <em>Herald</em> and the many poems
      by Whitman that were published in it, see Susan Belasco, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_titles/per.00104.html">The <em>New York Herald</em></a>."
