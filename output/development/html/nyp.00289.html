      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still troubled with a severe cold in my head—I suppose it is that which causes
      me 
      to have these bad spells, dizziness in the head—I have them a great deal lately; 
      sometimes three or four in an hour<sup><a href="#nyp.00289_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The 20 per cent bill came up again in Congress yesterday, &amp; was rejected again<sup><a href="#nyp.00289_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I don't think there is much chance for it—It looks as though we are going to have
      snow—feels cold &amp; raw—I am sitting at my desk in the office writing this—there is
      not much to do to-day in the office—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="opener"><em xmlns="">Wednesday afternoon</em>.
   </p>
   
   <p>It commenced snowing yesterday noon, &amp; stormed all day, 
      &amp; a rain at night—I have been out to-day—not any work hardly in the office—still I
      have to be around—it is a dark &amp; muddy day here—a young man has just been in with
      a photograph of me—his mother had bought it at a place here, &amp; sent it to me for me
      to write my name—I gratified him—They have taken a very good little photo of me here
      lately<sup><a href="#nyp.00289_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I will send you one before long—It is now three o'clock, &amp; the colored man has commenced
      to clean up—so I will vamose—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Great excitement here among the politicians—Cant tell who will be the new Attorney
      General under Grant—but don't think Mr. Evarts<sup><a href="#nyp.00289_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> will continue on—still I don't know—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="opener">Saturday forenoon. Feb. 6th.</p>                       
   
   <p>Mother, your letter has just come this forenoon—You must not worry about Han<sup><a href="#nyp.00289_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—one can't tell any thing about it—but it is probable things go on with them just
      as they always did—I believe I shall write to Han again—shall not say any thing about
      Heyde, of course—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have had a cold snap here—but this forenoon it is very pleasant, bright, &amp; comfortable
      enough—I did not have any bad spells in the head yesterday—nor, so far, to-day—My
      cold in the head has been extremely bad, &amp; is not well yet—Went up to Ashton's<sup><a href="#nyp.00289_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Thursday evening to spend the evening with some company—had supper about 9 o'clock.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I get along pretty well at the old boarding house—I suppose it is about as well as
      I could do any where—I make a fire these cold mornings, to wash &amp; dress by—it has
      been very cold lately—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="opener">Monday forenoon Feb. 8.</p>
   
   
   <p>Well, mother, I will finish my letter &amp; send it off—I thought to send it yesterday,
      Sunday, but did not come down to the office. All goes on the same with me—it is now
      about 11 oclock, and very pleasant—I am rather busy to-day with work in the office—but
      nothing to hurt—I have had a present of the most beautiful red rose you ever see—I
      have put it in a little glass of water, on my desk—Love to you, dearest mother, &amp;
      George &amp; all.<sup><a href="#nyp.00289_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup></p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00289_n1">1. Evidently Walt Whitman
      had written of his "bad spells" in an earlier (lost) letter, for on , his mother wrote: "i was sorry,
      Walter, you have them bad spells with your head. it must be very bad indeed,
      there is a kind of linement called 
      cloroform
      
       linement. it dont affect one in the least, that is to stupify, but it
      is thought to be good for the 
      neuralghy
      
       and rheumatism." An entry in an address book (Thomas Biggs Harned
      Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #109) would
      indicate that he went in January to Dr. Charles H. Bowen, a Washington physician
      mentioned in Whitman's  letter to
      Hiram Sholes.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00289_n2">2. A new bill intended to
      raise the salaries of governmental clerks by ten per cent (substituted for the
      "20 per cent bill") was defeated in the House of Representatives on February 1,
      1869. On the following day the New York <em>Times</em> commented:
      "The clerks were at it once more to-day."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00289_n3">3. A "capital photo" taken
      by Alexander Gardner was mentioned in the Washington <em>Star</em>
      on January 18, 1869.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00289_n4">4. William Maxwell Evarts
      (1818–1901) was chief counsel for Andrew Johnson during the impeachment
      trial of 1868. As a reward for his services, Johnson appointed Evarts Attorney
      General later in the year; Evarts was Secretary of State from 1877 to 1881 and
      U.S. Senator from New York from 1885 to 1891.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00289_n5">5. On , Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      complained about Hannah's failure to write to her: "sometimes i get so worried
      about her that it makes me quite unhappy."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00289_n6">6. J. Hubley Ashton, the
      assistant Attorney General, actively interested himself in Walt Whitman's
      affairs, and obtained a position for the poet in his office after the Harlan
      fracas.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00289_n7">7. 
      During the spring George was building houses in Brooklyn and, because of the
      tight money situation, was having trouble arranging construction loans. Jeff
      advanced $3,000, for which he was to receive a mortgage, and on , Louisa Van Velsor Whitman asked
      Walt Whitman to lend George $600. Though no correspondence on the subject
      between Walt Whitman and his family is extant, Jeff's letter of  confirms the fact that Walt
      Whitman assisted his brother, and on December 7, 1869,  Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      informed Walt Whitman that George was repaying $200.<br><br>
      During 1869 the lot of the Whitmans underwent no changes. Heyde still wrote
      nasty letters, and Hannah promised, when she got around to writing, a visit
      to Brooklyn. Martha's health did not improve markedly. Though George
      provided a new home for his mother, she complained that "these gals and
      amusements takes the greenbacks" (Summer, The Trent Collection of
      Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections
      Library). Mary Van Nostrand in October moved in "bag and baggage" with
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Evidently Ansel Van Nostrand failed in business,
      Louisa wrote on , "got a
      drinking," and "come near dying with the 
      deleru
      
      
      
      tremen
      
      ." Walt remained "the same good old standby." (Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman to Walt Whitman, .)<a href="#r7">[back]
