      <br></br><br></br>Dear Bro. Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr. Lane recd. your letter this morning<sup><a href="#loc.00413_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> and would have probably answered it to-day but has had to go out in the country (to
      Jamaica) to make some arrangements for a visit that the Common Council and Water Board
      intend to make over the works. In his behalf I return thanks for your kindness as
      regards Horace.<sup><a href="#loc.00413_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Mr Lane however has heard from him &nbsp;He was in the thickest of the fight but was not
      harmed although he had some pretty narrow escapes &nbsp;He says that some of the rebs took
      pretty good aim at him
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Walt, your letter has given me a great deal of pleasure, so it has Mr Lane in
      regard to Hooker and his movements.<sup><a href="#loc.00413_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I am so glad to understand that he is going in again. Tis sure that he could not
      have been badly whipped or he could not have done that, And Lee as you say must have
      been badly hurt or he would never let Hooker come across the river without molestation
      &nbsp;I wish you could send me letters oftener. I like to get your ideas of matters and
      also hear what the people down in Wash'tn think. Twas rather blue here for a few days, almost every one thought it was another
      bad defeat.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all thriving as usual. Mother is about the same as ever, somewhat lame with
      the rheumatism but not much &nbsp;the rest are all well. Andrew had a letter yesterday
      from Jim Cornwell,<sup><a href="#loc.00413_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> enclosing him $50 and telling him to come immediately to Suffolk,<sup><a href="#loc.00413_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> at the bottom was a transportation order from Frank Spinola.<sup><a href="#loc.00413_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Cornwell said if he did not come to give the money to his (Cornwells) wife, but to
      come sure if possible. I think Andrew very foolish not to go, as Ruggles<sup><a href="#loc.00413_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> says he certainly will never get <em>well</em> of his throat here. Andrew was to come for me and we were going to see the Dr. to-day
      abt his going but he did not come and mother thinks that he has concluded <em>not</em> to go. I think it would be much better for him to go &nbsp;I think it would be better
      for his health, dont you? They must intend to give him a pretty good show or they would not send "<em>surely come</em>" for him. We do not here from either Han or George do you? Hattie is the same as
      ever ever wanting to be out doors and wonders if Uncle Walt will never come and take
      her out on "<em>Ft. Greene</em>."<sup><a href="#loc.00413_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> She seems to remember you first rate and George too. What abt the pictures, shall I send them? The letter does not come out in the Eagle and probably
      will not but to make again sure I will call to-morrow and look over their file for
      some weeks back to see if I have possibly overlooked it. All send their love
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00413_n1">1. Jeff refers to Walt's
      letter to Moses Lane from . Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
      and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter of
      , and later various sums which
      Whitman acknowledged in letters from , , and . In his letter of , Lane pledged $5 each month. In an
      unpublished manuscript in the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York
      Public Library, Whitman wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed
      quite a large sum of money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in
      Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works
      there.)" Lane assisted Whitman in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from
      , and ). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal
      welfare that on , he sent through
      Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00413_n2">2. Some casualties from
      the Twentieth Connecticut Volunteers were in Washington hospitals, and Walt had
      promised "to make immediate inquiry" to determine whether Horace Tarr, the
      nephew of Moses Lane, was among them (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:99).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00413_n3">3. Walt had advised: "You
      there north must not be so disheartened about Hooker's return to this side of
      the Rappahannock and supposed failure. The blow struck at Lee &amp; the rebel
      sway in Virginia, &amp; generally at Richmond &amp; Jeff Davis, …is in my
      judgment the heaviest and most staggering they have yet got from us, &amp; has
      not only hit them nearer where they live than all Maclellan ever did, but all
      that has been levelled at Richmond during the war" (see Whitman's letter to
      Moses Lane from ).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00413_n4">4. James H. Cornwell was a
      first lieutenant in the 158th New York Regiment of Infantry. He was the
      quartermaster in charge of building fortifications at New Bern, North Carolina
      (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington
         Whitman</em> [Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1975], 96, n. 5).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00413_n5">5. As Loving notes, "it
      remains somewhat of a mystery as to why Andrew was beckoned only as far as
      Suffolk." Perhaps Andrew was to travel to Suffolk by boat, at which point
      Cornwell could have met him and conducted him to New Bern, North Carolina, by
      land. Andrew never made the trip (166).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00413_n6">6. See Jeff's letter to
      Walt from . Frank Spinola, a newly
      appointed brigadier general, was the first commander of the 158th New York
      Regiment of Infantry.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00413_n7">7. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his
      practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems"
      (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:90, n. 85).<a href="#r7">[back]
