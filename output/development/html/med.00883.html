   <p>Yours came yesterday and welcomed.<sup><a href="#med.00883_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I am here yet and
      allowing for the wear and decay-change, the situation continues much the same. You
      know I am well on my 71st year—lame and almost helpless in
      locomotion—inertia like a heavy swathing ample dropping pall over me most of
      the time, but my thoughts and to some extent mental action ab't the same as ever
      (queer ain't it?)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have had my daily mid-day massage (another just as I go to bed). Tho't of going
      out
      a little in my wheel chair but it is bitter cold today here and I shall not. I have
      just sent a half-page poem to Gilder<sup><a href="#n0871" id="r3">3</a></sup>, they have accepted, paid,
      proofed it, and I believe it will be out in May number.<sup><a href="#loc.07757_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I have just had a drink of milk punch—am sitting at present in my two-story den
      in Mickle St, alone as usual, more buoyant than you might suppose

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00883_n1">1. In her book <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (1931), Clara Barrus
      observes that this letter "came on Sunday afternoon, March 2"—a statement
      which may mean that Whitman wrote it on that day or that the letter reached
      Burroughs on Sunday afternoon. The former is more plausible. Burroughs' letter
      of  reveals that he was still
      depressed, living separate most of the time from his wife, and nostalgic: "How
      sweet is memory! as one grows old how much he lives in the past, how trivial
      &amp; cheap seems the present. A tender &amp; beautiful light fills my mind when
      I think of those years in Washington when we were all there; a light I know that
      never was on sea or land. How solemn &amp; pathetic, as well as beautiful it
      must seem to you, considering all you passed through then!" On , Richard Maurice Bucke was annoyed at
      Burroughs' tone: "What ails the fellow that he is so damned pathetic? He is (I
      judge) fairly well fixed (as things go)—good reputation, lovely home,
      enough to eat &amp;c. &amp;c. then why is he so infernally down in the mouth all
      the time? I don't see anything to whine about in getting old—think (on the
      whole) it is rather a good joke—My strongest feeling about it is: what is
      to come next? That we are going to (or towards) the bad all the time does not
      occur to me as likely at all and if not what is there to be blue about?"<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0871">3. Richard Watson Gilder
      (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <em>The Century</em>, from 1881 until his death. Whitman had met
      Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1955], 482). Whitman attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
      Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the <em>New York Tribune</em>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder
      one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
      delirium" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">Sunday, August 5, 1888</a>). For more about Gilder, see Susan L.
