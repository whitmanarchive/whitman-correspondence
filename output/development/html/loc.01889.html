      <br xmlns="" class="opener">31 March.
      
      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your very interesting &amp; valued letter of 30 Jan? ought to have been answered before now. As you
      are willing to confess in it, however, to being an irregular correspondent, I gladly
      avail myself of so tempting an opening for saying that I am the same—&amp;
      shall feel confident that my delay is pardoned.
   </p>
   
   <p>I read with much zeal the poem you kindly sent me, with its deep sonata–like
      alternations of emotion.
   </p>
   
   <p>It was a peculiar pleasure to me to get acquainted with Mr. Burroughs,  to whom 
      w.d
      
       you please remember me with great cordiality whenever the chance occurs.
      He may have told you—&amp; indeed it cannot have needed telling—that you
      were a very principal subject of our discourse, &amp; of my reiterated
      enquiries.
   </p>
   
   <p>It interests me to see in your letter that you have a habit of taking moonlight walks
      out of Washington: I used to find walks of this kind highly enjoyable, &amp; have
      frequently indulged in them years ago. In my youth I was living in habits of daily
      &amp; brotherly intimacy with various painters (Millais, Holman
      Hunt, &amp;c); &amp; from time to time we 
      w.d
      
       all sally out, 6 or 7, say towards 11 at
      night, &amp; pass the whole
      night, &amp; sometimes the succeeding day  as well, tramping about, &amp; enjoying
      the varying effects of night, dawn, &amp;c—studied of course with peculiar
      interest, &amp; directness of observation &amp; purpose, by the painters: sometimes,
      instead of walking, we 
      w.d
      
       row up the river from nightfall to day. There is a goodish deal of
      agreeable country round London: but, unless one lives quite out in the suburbs, it
      takes miles of walking to get even to the beginning of anything green or rural. I
      can easily imagine that to walk out of Washington at night "into Virginia or
      Maryland" is an experience of a very different sort, in point of grandeur &amp;
      impressiveness. 
      Tho'
      
       indeed, from some points of view 
      wh.
      
       you of all men realize most intensely, nothing surely can be more
      impressive than the unmeasured size  &amp; colossal agglomeration of life in London—none the
      less felt through the interminable streets when all are asleep, &amp; scarcely a
      passenger met athwart one's path. The interval when the streets are really deserted
      to this extent is but brief: I suppose from about 2 ¾ to 4 a.m. is the most
      vacant time.
   </p>
   
   <p>What you say about the insulting &amp; in fact ungrateful treatment 
      wh.
      
       your poems continue to receive in America is deeply interesting, 
      tho'
      
       painful. I suppose it is a very general if not universal experience that
      anything that is at once great &amp; extremely novel encounters for some
      considerable time much more hostility than acceptance, &amp; so far your experience
      is not surprising—rather indeed a testimonial, when properly considered, to
      the great intrinsic value of your writings. But certainly  it does seem that in degree &amp;
      duration the obduracy of Americans 
      agst.
      
       your work is something abnormal &amp; unworthy—especially
      considering the spirit of intense patriotic love &amp; national insight 
      wh.
      
       pervades your book 
      thro
      
       &amp; 
      thro
      
      . That America 
      sh.d
      
       be so wanting (in this matter at least) in large receptiveness &amp; quick
      intuition is distressing to those who love her—among whom I may humbly but
      truly profess myself. It seems as if she were even <u>less</u>
      capable than others of appreciating great work vital with the very marrow of her
      bones &amp; corpuscles of her blood: perhaps this very affinity is partly the
      reason—but at any rate a bad &amp; perverse reason. In this country there are
      of course very diverse knots of opinion, &amp; schools of thinking &amp; criticism,
      &amp; to several of these your  works are still an exasperation &amp; an offence: but others
      accept &amp; exalt you with all readiness of love &amp; delight, &amp; I think I may
      safely say that it is these 
      wh
      
       have in their holding the future of English opinion on such matters for
      some years to come.—But I will say no more on this tack. For myself (with
      others) who believe in you with the certainty of full conviction, all these
      considerations are poor &amp; slight: the one thing in the work itself, &amp; the
      maker of the work, which has a destiny as assured &amp; as limitless as that of any
      other great product of the soul or of nature.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have not met Prof. Dowden since last summer (or spring perhaps): he is seldom, I
      think, out of Ireland. 
      What I saw of him I liked particularly. He seems an uncommonly young man to be a
      Professor—less than 30 to look at; &amp; is in no common degree
      good–looking, pleasant, open, &amp; sound–minded. There are few men, I 
      sh.d
      
       say, more likely to have their sympathies in literary matters sane and
      right—guided also by the fullest measure of lettered cultivation. Mrs.
      Gilchrist I dined with not many weeks ago. She seems to
      have fairly recovered from a very exhaustive &amp; indeed dangerous illness that
      oppressed her of late (say from the early autumn of 1870 to the late summer of
      1871)—only that she is not so capable as she used to be of continuous mental
      or bodily strain. It was a pleasure to see her surrounded by her family,  the type of a true
      mother, guiding &amp; nurturing all aright in her children, mind &amp; body. The
      eldest son bids fair to have a distinguished &amp; prosperous career as a mining
      engineer: a younger son is greatly set on being a painter. One of the daughters is
      just about grown up, the other, I suppose, 10 or 11 years of age.—Mr. J. A.
      Symonds I don't know personally; but, about the time when
      my selection from your Poems came out, he wrote to me (2 or 3 letters) showing
      himself to have been for some while fast one of your very ardent admirers. Tennyson
      I have known for years, &amp; like much, I think him deep–hearted &amp;
      high–minded, 
      tho
      
       it may be true (as has often been said, &amp; sometimes not in a kindly
       spirit) that he is
      somewhat too self–centred, &amp; morbidly sensitive. He hates all the <u>vulgarizing</u> aspects of fame, &amp; some people find him
      present a very obtuse exterior to their advances or approaches: for myself, I can
      truly say my experience is the direct contrary. I think you &amp; he 
      w.d
      
       understand each other, &amp; feel on a very friendly footing. Tennyson (as
      I dare say you know) is a remarkably fine manly person to look at, with a noble
      mould of face, &amp; very powerful frame. He must be 6 foot 1 in height. I 
      sh.d
      
       suppose—but not now, so erect as in his prime.— If you do at
      any time come to England, to see Tennyson or others, I need not say what a delight
      it 
      w.d
      
       be to me to know you personally—&amp; several of my friends 
      w.d
      
       amply  share
      my feeling.
   </p>
   
   <p>My vol. of Selections from American Poets doesn't seem likely to
      be published yet awhile. It has been completed for 
      mo.s
      
       past: but, as it is one vol. of a series, &amp; others of the vols. are in
      course of printing, the printer may probably leave it over for a few 
      mo.s
      
       to come. I have in the briefest terms dedicated it to you (&amp; hope you
      won't object). Any other dedication—at least, if to any one on your side of
      the Atlantic—
      wd
      
       be a fatuity.
   </p>

      Believe me 
      honoured
      
       to be called your friend,
      <br></br>W. M. Rossetti
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I have no doubt you will have felt sorrow as I did—
      tho
      
       indeed sorrow is not fully the right word, nor the right emotion—at reading
      lately of the death of Mazzini. I, who am ¾ Italian in
      blood, have naturally a strong feeling on these subjects: &amp; I regard Mazzini
      as the noblest of patriots, &amp; the man to whom more than any other single
      person not even excepting Garibaldi, the lovers of Italian unity are beholden.
      It is often a pleasure to me to reflect that, with all the miserable oppression
      &amp; depression under 
      wh.
      
       she has so long been 
      labouring
      
      , Italy has after all produced the 3 greatest public men (to my
      thinking such) of the last 100 years in England—
   </p>
   
   <p>1.
      Napoleon I, the greatest genius as a conqueror &amp; ruler
      (I suppose any one is to be allowed to admire  him enormously, whether one approves
      him or not— &amp; to call him a Frenchman, or anything save an Italian, is
      meaningless)
   </p>
   
   <p>2. Mazzini, the greatest of ideal statesmen—patriot—</p>
   
   <p>3. Garibaldi, the greatest &amp; most flawless personal hero.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
