   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07287_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey U.S.A. It is postmarked:
      London | PM | DE 24 | 88 | Canada; Camden [illegible] | Dec | 2[illegible] | 6
      AM | [illegible] | Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07287_n2">2. Letters for December
      24 and 26, 1888, are currently missing. From the surviving evidence it is
      possible to reconstruct the general nature of these letters.<br><br>On , Whitman wrote Bucke: "have
      rec'd yours of 24th, &amp; note carefully what you say of food, alcohol,
      &amp;c, and of the effete wretchedness—all thoroughly judged &amp;
      true, &amp; shall charge myself practically with it—certainly
      so—&amp; glad to get it."<br><br>The extant Bucke letter to Whitman of
      December 24 contains no mention of diet. It would appear that Bucke wrote
      <em>two</em> letters to Whitman that day—something
      which he did on occasion (e.g. , and ).
      On December 29, 1888, Bucke wrote Traubel: "I have urged the warm bath,
      medicine, moderate diet (almost starvation diet is safest for him) he has
      answered my letter and says he will attend to what I say" (Feinberg). Bucke
      is referring to the letter Whitman wrote on . Some further evidence of the content of this letter is
      provided by Traubel:<br><br>"Among the letters W. gave me yesterday [December
      27, 1888] was one from Bucke very specific about W.'s diet. W. said
      to-night: 'It is—yes it is—a very good letter: I am conscious it
      should be obeyed. I know no one better able to say these things than Bucke.'
      Bucke had advised that the letter be shown to Walsh, who could give more
      direct instructions. W. has not done this: it is doubtful if he will, though
      he may" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.58.html">Friday, December 28, 1888</a>).<br><br>It is more difficult to
      reconstruct the nature of Bucke's letter to Whitman of December 26,
      1888.<br><br>On , Whitman
      wrote Bucke: "y'rs of 26th came last evn'g—Yes, I shall <em>mind</em>—think I understand &amp; accept the matter
      below it, &amp; shall practically put it in action."<br><br>[Lozynsky
      goes on to argue that] Bucke's letter of December 26 was a follow-up to his letter
      of
      the 24th concerning diet. In his December 29 letter, Whitman may be
      reassuring Bucke that he intends to keep the promise made in his letter of
      the 27th. The fact that both these letters are missing suggests a link
      between them. They were put aside either for consultation about specific
      details or, as Traubel mentions, for presentation to Dr. Walsh. [Note copied from

   <p id="n4137">4. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

   <p id="n4284">7. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
