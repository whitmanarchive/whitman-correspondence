   <p>Dave, I don't see how I can make the books bill any less than 33cts (&amp; you to pay
      the binder)—they cost me more than
      that—&amp; <u>that</u> was what—10ct binding—I
      calculated from what Oldach<sup><a href="#n4170" id="r1">1</a></sup> sent specifically (though he now
      makes it more now)—I have to request you will sign the memorandum &amp; send
      back to me by Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I send the order on Oldach<sup><a href="#upa.00124_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4170">1. Frederick Oldach (1823–1907)
      was a German bookbinder whose Philadelphia firm bound Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> (1888) and <em>Complete
         Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), as well as the special seventieth-birthday
      issue of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1889).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="upa.00124_n1">3. Whitman drew up documents
      that provided for the following: McKay was to receive 950 copies of <em>November Boughs</em> for $313.50; Oldach was to give the
      books to McKay, who was to pay for the binding—"except for 100 copies wh.
      I will pay you"; and McKay was to pay Whitman $313.50 by January 10, 1889,
      and had the right to print additional copies of <em>November
         Boughs</em> for three years on the payment of "twelve (12) cents royalty a
      copy," and Whitman was to have fifty copies "of the present batch . . . free for
      editors' copies" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.100.html">Monday, October 22, 1888</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
