      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still well, for me, &amp; having good (or at any rate not <em>ill</em>) times—Return'd from Kirkwood yesterday<sup><a href="#upa.00193_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Am there half the time—(have a room all to myself, good bed, good stove, &amp;c)—Must
      tell you about Herb's picture, he calls <em>September Days</em>—(name not very good, but will do)—Picture itself, in my opinion, <em>very good</em>, the best he has painted, such opulence, mellowness of color that would be your first
      feeling, &amp; would fill you as it did me—it is a very simple scene (story) only well
      shaded opening in the creek, with water 'way to the foreground, &amp; five or six ducks
      &amp; drakes—foliage meeting at top, no sky, every thing very broad, foliage in masses,
      all the handling easy &amp; large, yet sufficiently defined—really a <em>fine, original</em>, rich picture, &amp; in treatment no following of any thing Herb has done before<sup><a href="#upa.00193_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Our folks are well as usual—(it is toward noon)—My sister is off to church somewhere—brother
      down stairs balancing his acct's—I up here in my 3d story front room writing this—the Nov. wind whistling sharp, but
      sun shining—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The Staffords about as usual—crops &amp; every thing pretty fair this fall, with them—Mrs
      S keeps about, works hard, devotes all to her family &amp; friends, (woman like)—Debby
      &amp; her husband all right—Harry well &amp; at work at printing—I saw Arthur Peterson,<sup><a href="#upa.00193_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> they are all well—Return me Tennyson's and John Burroughs' letters—(no hurry though,
      only be careful of T's)—Best love—

   <p>Tennyson's letter was delayed, sent back as you will see—I only rec'd it a week ago<sup><a href="#upa.00193_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00193_n1">1. According to his
      Commonplace Book, Whitman returned from Kirkwood on November 8 (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="upa.00193_n2">2. On , Anne Gilchrist had written from
      Concord, Mass., about her visit with Emerson, and had inquired about Herbert's
      portrait of Whitman and his landscape (<em>The Letters of Anne
         Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Thomas B. Harned [New York: Doubleday,
      Page &amp; Company, 1918], 161–162). On , she expressed her delight with the description of Herbert's
      painting but wondered whether Whitman was satisfied with the portrait (<em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em>,
      164).<a href="#r2">[back]
