      <br xmlns="" class="opener">May 9,
      1881.
      
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of the 7th came duly, and I am very glad to get the outline of the facts in the
      Osgood matter. I mean to use them, for they make the case worse for Osgood &amp; Co.
      than before, inasmuch as they show that the book was published at their
      solicitation, and
      
      
      with a knowledge of its character, and a distinct understanding that there was to
      be
      no excision. If you had not accepted their proposal to abandon the publication, you
      would have the best grounds for a suit against them for damages. I intend to
      excoriate them for their shameful part in this shameful transaction.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I am at work on my Tribune letter, which I hope will prove satisfactory. The
      composition is difficult for several reasons, brevity being necessary to ensure
      publication, and tact and adroitness being requisite also, in view of the general
      prejudice and bedevilment of the public on all sexual questions. Nothing is more
      melancholy than the
      
      
      horrible omni-prevalent sophistication of people in these matters.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad you are to have an article in the <u>North American</u>,
      and only wish it were to be longer. Anything from you in exposition of these poems
      will be valuable, but a careful, powerful, dignified, elaborately reasoned paper
      from your pen would be an
      
      
      
      immense light and service. I read again last
      night what you wrote on this subject in your letter to Emerson in the second
      edition. It is magnificent, both in matter and manner, and might well be
      reprinted.
   </p>
   
   <p>When such a thing is done as the State
      
      
      Attorney has done, it is time to
      make roaring war. I mean to open the cannonade anyway, and it will go hard if
      abroad, at least, we don't hear the response of rifled ordnance from the batteries
      we planted. I charged John Burroughs before sailing to make it his business
      
      
      to fire the
      British heart on every occasion. I only wish I were not tied up as I am with this
      weary office, and work monstrous and endless, as it is.
   </p>
   
   <p>Take care of your health all you can. The season is dangerous—a late spring,
      mutable and treacherous. But the bland weather is
      
      
      near at hand.
   </p>
   
   <p>—I shall hardly need the <u>raison d'etre</u> of your
      article for mine. The outrage is sufficient excuse for the ventilation. I only hope
      I can say what I want to, and get printed.
   </p>
