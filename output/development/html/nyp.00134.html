      <br></br><br></br>Mr. W. D. O'Connor
      
      <br></br>Dr. Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I received this morning yours of March 14th<sup><a href="#nyp.00134_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I am deeply sensible of the interest you have taken for me and return my sincere
      and heartfelt thanks for it. The position—although very desirable in all respects
      is one that I am not in the least qualified to fill—it is an entirely different branch
      of the profession from that in which I have been engaged—My Engineering education
      and <em>entire experience</em> has been in the <em>construction</em> of work[s], such as laying out masonry, location and the general superintendance of building a piece of work—As a draughtsman I am totally deficient—my efforts in
      that direction being limited entirely to a rough pencil sketch to convey the idea
      of what is wanted to the workman—Therefore I am certain that I am not qualified and
      could not justify your generous recommendation of me for the appointment
   </p>
   
   <p>Hoping sir, that I may some time personally thank you for the trouble you have taken
      and kindness shown me I am very respectfully
   </p>
