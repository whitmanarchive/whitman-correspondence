   <p>In reply to your note of some days since, in reference to acting as my agent, for
      sale of "Leaves of Grass," I would say as follows:

   <p>I presume that Anderson &amp; Archer, binders, No. 6 Reade street, N. Y., have
      now ready 100 copies, just bound.<sup><a href="#loc.01566_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> These you can have, if desired, as follows:

   <p>14 copies, as I understand from French &amp; Richardson, are due you, having
      already been paid for by you. The remaining 76 copies you can have at $1 (?)
      8cts [each], this is [<em>incomplete</em>]<sup><a href="#loc.01566_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>

      Endorsed (by Walt Whitman): "sent M. Doolady | 448"<br><br>
      Bookseller and publisher, Michael Doolady was the publisher of Ada Clare's
      <em>Only a Woman's Heart</em> (1866).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01566_n3">2. Walt Whitman later
      reduced his order to 90 copies for $31.50 in his  letter to Anderson and Archer.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.01566_n2">3. The publishing history of
      the 1867 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> is confused. The
      first issue was printed by Chapin, and Walt Whitman considered asking Henry E.
      Huntington Library and Son to distribute it; see Whitman's  letter to William D. O'Connor. One
      of the later issues, to which <em>Drum-Taps</em> was added, was
      bound by James Gray, who became bankrupt; see Whitman's  letter to Dionysius Thomas. Apparently Anderson and
      Archer received and bound the sheets in Gray's possession. Dionysius Thomas and
      Doolady, rather than Henry E. Huntington Library and Son, evidently distributed
      the book. According to his letter of , Whitman paid Anderson and Archer $.35 each for binding <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
