       &amp; glad to hear from you—have not forgotten those pleasant calls

      &amp; somewhat changed) California magazine criticism<sup><a href="#duk.00761_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—the copy you showed Osgood—&amp; thought it noble—
   </p>
   
   <p>Am thankful to you &amp; of course much pleased with your study of, &amp; exploiting
      L of G—have just sent you a package by express of the late &amp; other
      editions &amp; Vols. of poems &amp;c. as my Christmas offering<sup><a href="#duk.00761_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—with affectionate remembrances—
