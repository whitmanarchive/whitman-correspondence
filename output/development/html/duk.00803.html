      <br></br><br></br>Dear John Burroughs
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours just received (with the 10—many thanks—)—the kind invitation
      reiterated<sup><a href="#duk.00803_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—&amp;c—I am in pretty fair
      condition generally, but unable to walk or get around, except very small stretches,
      &amp; with effort—somehow feel averse to leaving this shanty of
      mine—where I am probably getting along better than you think—
   </p>
   <p>Mrs
      Gilchrist's essay has appeared in the <em>To-Day</em>—probably
      she will send it to you—if not, I will send you mine—It is a noble
      paper—I have a little poem to appear in the <em>Outing</em>,
      perhaps in the forthcoming number<sup><a href="#duk.00803_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Mary Smith &amp;
      all the family (our Germantown friends) start for Europe to-morrow to be gone over
      a
      year.
   </p>
   
   <p>As I write it is a delightful day—temperature perfect—I take the car to
      the ferry, &amp; get out on the river every pleasant day.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
