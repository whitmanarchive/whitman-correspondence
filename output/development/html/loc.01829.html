      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have called several times to say that I have 
      recd
      
       a letter from Mr. Townsend. In it he refers to you and your "Leaves" as
      follows: "Tell Walt Whitman that I felt myself after reading the preface to his book
      in the presence of a stupendous genius, like a man before [
      <span class="unclear">Aep?</span>]
      
      suddenly. I read the rest of it on the [illegible] vast as its conception. There is a noble
      acorn in it, and a [illegible] availability.
       It is the song of a God, with a
      broadaxe in his hand, opening a Broadway in the setting sun."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am off for New Castle, Pa for the summer, and I hope you will write me there. I
      shall expect it.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Hiram J. Ramsdell (1839–1887) was a clerk in
      Washington; in a hospital notebook (Henry E. Huntington Library), Walt Whitman
      called him "chief clerk."Ramsdell was the Washington correspondent for the New
      York <em>Tribune</em> and the Cincinnati <em>Commercial</em>. On , Ramsdell
      reported the high praise that George Townsend, the journalist (1841–1914),
      accorded to Walt Whitman—"a stupendous genius," "the song of a God." On
      , he asked Walt Whitman to do
      whatever he could for Judge Milton Kelly, of Idaho, against whom charges had
      been brought by "a very bad man," Congressman Edward Dexter Holbrook
      (1836–1870), a Democrat from the Idaho Territory. Actually, on July 12,
      1867, Walt Whitman had submitted to the Attorney General a "Report on the <em>Charges</em> submitted by <em>Hon. E. D.
         Holbrook</em>, Del[egate] from Idaho Terr[itory], <em>against</em>
      <em>Hon. Milton Kelly</em>, Asso[ciate] Just[ice] Supreme Court of
      Idaho" (National Archives). To this forty-one page summary of the evidence, all
      in Walt Whitman's hand, there is appended a letter signed by attorney general
      Henry Stanbery (1803–1881) but written by Walt Whitman, dated July 20,
      1867: "The Conclusion in the preceding Report is hereby adopted by me, &amp;
      ordered to stand as the decision of this Office in the Case, so far as now
      presented." On July 22, 1867, Ramsdell apologized for his "aggressiveness."
      (Ramsdell's letters are in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.) Judge Kelly
      wrote to Walt Whitman on June(?) 21, 1867 (National Archives), and again on  (Yale). On November 15, 1875,
      Ramsdell, among others, petitioned Benjamin H. Bristow (1832–1896),
      Secretary of the Treasury, that Walt Whitman "be appointed to a position in the
      Treasury Department" (National Archives).
