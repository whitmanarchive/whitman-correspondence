      <br></br><br></br>My dear master
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish you could send me, if you have them loose, a few of your
      portraits, especially of the shirt-sleeves one—or perhaps you could tell
      me where they are to be had, if they are attainable to the public? I should like
      also to have a couple of copies of a brief autobiographical note of which Edward
      Dowden gave me a copy some time ago—intended to
      accompany presentation copies of the L. of G.<sup><a href="#loc.05119_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> I am just
      home from a summer's walking-tour in Switzerland, where I, and a friend who lives
      here, had a glorious time together. Anything more bracing and invigorating than the
      air on the high mountain passes it is impossible to conceive. We went over one
      glacier, where my friend distinguished himself by falling into a crevasse. As we
      were all roped together—two guides and ourselves, he was extricated without
      much damage. Scenery on the glacier the
      'Tschingel' was marvellous. It is a vast lake of ice, probably some 200
      feet deep, lying 
      high among the peaks of the Bernese Oberland. It is mostly covered with a thin
      coating of snow, but at one point it pours down through a break in the
      mountain-wall, by a kind of gorge or ravine, into a deep valley. It has the
      aspect then of a river, not a lake; and at this point there is no snow—the
      ice being heaped up into enormous ridges &amp; pinnacles like a river when there is
      a long reach of rapids, only in the glacier everything is much vaster—the
      waves as big as a terrace of houses, with deep chasms between them walled as far as
      one can see with gleaming ice. The ice is only semitransparent &amp; is of a very
      strange pale green hue. The wild, tossing confusion of the ice-river
      contrasted strangely with the absolute stillness and immoveability, broken only, now
      &amp; then, when some great block would totter over and come thundering down into the
      valley, hurling huge fragments &amp; splinters into the air as if they were dust.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am working now at an essay on the L. of G. which I am to read before a literary
      society here. Shall introduce quotations liberally &amp; see what they think of my translation.
      If I like this essay when it is done I will publish it here in pamphlet form &amp;
      send it well about Germany.<sup><a href="#loc.05119_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> I suppose you got a page of
      translation I sent you some time ago?<sup><a href="#loc.05119_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I hope all is going well with you. Heard some months ago of an intended prosecution
      of the new edition—but I suppose that was a mere 'canard.'<sup><a href="#loc.05119_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Much interest here about the English in Egypt.<sup><a href="#loc.05119_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> A shameful
      business altogether, which makes me thankful that I am not an Englishman except
      against my will. The other European governments feel some satisfaction at the course
      taken—whenever might is the order of the day despotism feels securer, &amp; they
      like to see England, the home of liberty, acting as unjustly as any dynasty with its
      traditions of iniquity. They do not yet fully comprehend that English liberty is
      regarded as being only fit for Englishmen.
   </p>
   
   <p>I suppose you have seen  Swinburne's new
      vol. Tristram of Lyonesse.<sup><a href="#loc.05119_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup> There seems some fine verse
      in it—especially the ode to Athens, but I have not read it thoroughly yet.
   </p>
   
   <p>Now farewell, with all good wishes &amp; greeting. Please do not forget about the
      portraits and Note.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05119_n2">1. The first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> contains a portrait of Whitman in shirt
      sleeves. It is a steel engraving done by Samuel Hollyer from a daguerreotype
      taken in 1854 by Gabriel Harrison of Brooklyn. The picture, which is used again
      in the second, sixth, and seventh editions, is probably the one to which
      Rolleston refers.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05119_n3">2. Rolleston read a lecture
      on Whitman before the Literarischer Verein of Dresden on September 25, 1883. The
      lecture was published in <em>Ueber Wordsworth und Walt
         Whitman</em>; Zwei Vorträge von H. B. Cotterill und T. W. Rolleston
      (Dresden, 1883). Rolleston gave a humorous account of the Dresden society in
      "The Literarischer Verein of Augustusstadt," <em>The Dublin
         University Review</em>, 1 (April 1885), 50–52. The article, which is
      signed "T.W.R.," contains some interesting reflections on German poetry and
      criticism. Rolleston also commented on the lectures on Wordsworth and Whitman
      which he and Cotterill had given before the society and claimed that "Walt
      Whitman got, on the whole, a rather more encouraging reception, perhaps because
      he was treated from a more exlusively philosophical point of view." After the
      joint publication, in pamphlet form, of <em>Ueber Wordsworth und
         Walt Whitman</em>, a good part of it was translated into English by Horace
      Traubel and appeared in the Camden <em>Post</em> on Feburary 13,
      1884.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05119_n4">3. See the enclosure to the
      letter from Rolleston to Whitman of .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05119_n5">4. The "some months ago"
      would coincide with his statement of 
      that he had just heard about the controversy over the "Children of Adam"; both
      references then are to the banning of the Boston edition of 1882.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05119_n6">5. When Egypt's hazardous
      financial situation required European intervention, England and France
      established dual control in 1876. An antiforeign uprising was crushed in May,
      1882, by the British Forces.<a href="#r5">[back]
