   <p>I want to write you a few lines particular. Do not call to see me any more at the
      Stafford family, &amp; do not call there at all any more. Dont ask me why—I will explain
      to you when we meet.<sup><a href="#loc.01251_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> When you meet any of the family I wish you to use them just the 
      
      
      
      same as ever, but do not go over there at all. I want you to keep this to yourself,
      &amp; not mention it nor this letter to any one &amp; you must not speak about it at all to
      any one.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing in it that I think I do wrong, nor am ashamed of, but I wish it kept
      entirely between you and me—&amp; I shall feel very much hurt &amp; displeased if you don't
      keep the whole thing &amp; the present letter entirely to yourself. Mr and Mrs Stafford
      are very near &amp; kind to me, &amp; have been &amp; are like brother &amp; sister to me—&amp; as to
      Harry you know how I love him. Ed you too have my unalterable love, &amp; always shall
      have. I want you to come up here &amp; see me.<sup><a href="#loc.01251_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> Write when will you come.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01251_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "letter to | Ed Cattell"; "letter sent to | Ed Cattell." It is a draft
      letter.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.01251_n2">2. Edward Cattell was a
      young, semiliterate farm hand and a friend of the Staffords. Whitman met him
      evidently in May, 1876: "about 25 or 6—folks mother, father &amp;c. live
      at Gloucester—his grand, or great grandfather, Jonas Cattell, a great
      runner, &amp; Revolutionary soldier, spy." (Whitman referred to Jonas in the
      Philadelphia <em>Times</em> on January 26, 1879.) Later in the
      same diary the poet wrote: "the hour (night, June 19, '76, Ed &amp; I.) at the
      front gate by the road." Two days later he noted "the swim of the boys, Ed.
      [Stafford?], Ed. C. &amp; Harry" (<em>Diary Notes</em> in Charles
      E. Feinberg Collection). In 1877 Whitman cited "Sept meetings Ed C by the pond
      at Kirkwood moonlight nights" (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.), and in <em>Diary Notes</em> on October 29, "Ed. Cattell
      with me." On , Cattell, who
      generally called Whitman "old man," wrote: "Would love to See you once moor for
      it seems an age Since I last met With you down at the pond and a lovely time We
      had of it to old man . . . I love you Walt and Know that my love is returned
      to." In another letter from ,
      Cattell said: "Went with Some Boys up the Pond to day and I Seen your old Chir
      floting down the Strem. . . . i would like to See you and have a talk. I love
      you Walt and all ways Will. So May God Bless You is my prayer."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.01251_n3">4. Whitman deleted the
