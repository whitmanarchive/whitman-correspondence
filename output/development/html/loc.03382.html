   <p>
      Your letter of Nov. 3rd, enclosing two  "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00139.html">Sunset Breeze</a>"
      &amp; "Shakespeare" from <u>Poet Lore</u>, slip of relpy at ingersoll's lecture<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r1">1</a></sup>, "Old Poets", 
      two Philadelphia newspapers with reports of lecture &amp; two "Truthseekers," have all
      arrived safely and increased our debt of gratitude to 
      our bard and our friend (we have the hope that your influence will tend to make all
      bards and all friends. When every pick stroke 
      in the heart of a labour-metre &amp; every through-train an epic in the eyes of the workers,
      and when the old spirit of 
      <u>camaraderie</u>, fitfully shown now &amp; then by the way men stick together &amp; starve for each other
      in the strikes etc, tints men's lives like the Javan volcano tinted our Australian
      afterglow during the last few years, that will be
      "the good time coming." in mathematical formula of man = friend = bard, then happiness
      = ∞.)
      
   </p>

      That lecture of Ingersoll's must have been a rare one, as it comes to us, its mere
      shadow, is grand. Ingersoll has an illustration
      in his lecture on Humboldt which fits himself here. He refers to Chimborazo with Humboldt
      at its feet. Here was another intrepid explorer
      and lover of truth, clearing away prejudice from another America, and here in this
      lecture, sitting nobly and ennobled at the feet of literature's
      Chimborazo. If this should sound high-falutin kindly remember an Irish enthusiasm
      pens it, and an Irish earnestness warms it.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Jim &amp; Fred &amp; "Tom Touchstone," and all of us at home, send you our love and a hearty
      Australian new year's greeting, and wish we could
      personally thank Ingersoll for his kindness to you (You seemed so much better this
      letter than last, that we kind o' feel inclined to give Ingersoll 
      a bit of the credit and the thanks heartfelt I can tell you.)

      I am busy studying philosophy for a university exam, and the result is that I haven't 
      a decent thought to tell you. My word, the general run of it <u>does</u>
      want your test of the "open air" consideration, and a pruning according, that same
      "open air" would blow most of it
      to oblivion, like a hot wind a heat of frea-chaff. The stuff gives you an intellectual
      dry-rot &amp; how you sift for days when you can say
      as out poet Jordan said
   </p> 
   
   "Twas merry mid the blackwoods, to spy the station roofs
   <br>&amp; wheel the wild scrub-cattle at the yard,
   <br>With running fire of stockwhips &amp; a fiery rim of hoofs—
   <br>O the hardest day was never then too hard!"
   
   
   <p>
      We're going to have a grand day on Christmas, about 80 children are coming to our
      place &amp;
      we are going to do all kinds of wonderful comical &amp; enjoyable things to please them.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I tried to get some of Ingersoll's lecture in the leading papers here, but they are
      a little too bigoted &amp;
      so no result as yet

      You <u>did</u> interest us by referring to your Japanese correspondent. We have been studying that
      country, its
      literature &amp; national character, and are pleased greatly that your "Leaves" have a
      prospect of being able to wreathe the brows of the
      "Daughter of the Sun." By the way, how do you think "Leaves of Grass" will translate
      into languages? "We have discussed the question and vary much.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Thanks again for your great kindness to us and our need of thanks for that greater
      kindness to man your publication of Leaves of Grass has been.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0839">1. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r1">[back]
