      <br></br><br></br>To Walt Whitman
      <br></br>Camden, N.J.
      <br></br>U.S.A.
      <br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am the glad owner of a copy in two volumes—"Leaves of Grass" and "Two
      Rivulets"—of your works, Author's Centennial Edition, with photograph and
      Autograph. I am an old resident of this Isthmus, but, a New Yorker by birth and
      education, I am, I trust, a thorough American. These highly prized volumes of yours,
      and mine, became the latter by subscription, through my dear dead sister, (then Mrs
      Andrew Jackson [
      <span class="unclear">Louis?</span>]
      ,) at the time of their publication. They have lain now a long time
      in New York until I sent for them and they came a month ago
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Not to weary you, I have now read over again Preface, Poems and Notes of "Two
      Rivulets," and "Democratic Vistas" since the books came, and am impelled to say to
      you that I rejoice greatly that my country has given birth to one who has placed on
      record so grand a presentation of her case!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Entering upon the New Year,let me then, my dear Walt Whitman, send you warm greeting
      from the Tropic world, and wish you all things good and happy! I too have ventured
      a
      little upon verse, (of which I will send you an unbound copy, having at present none
      other) and <u>hope</u> I am a "live American". The prose 4th of
      July address pray look at though you let the verses go by.
   </p>
