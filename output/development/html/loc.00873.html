      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir.â€”
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The undersigned though a comparative stranger to you feels himself drawn toward you
      closer and closer after perusing your "Leaves of Grass." We have a sympathy in common
      with you. in some of these well wrought passages the experiences taught there has
      been
      one to some extent.
   </p>
   
   <p>While doing garrison duty with my regiment the 2nd New York Arty on the works South
      of
      the Potomac I visited Washington in company with a comrade named Charles String of
      Connecticut<sup><a href="#loc.00873_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> and by him introduced to you at your studio.
      (I forget the street) but it was not far removed from the avenue. if I mistake not,
      you
      accompanied us to the theatre at night. I have never forgotten you since, remembering
      you as a friend to the Union and the "boys" striving to keep it together. I left the
      regiment in the trenches in front of Petersburgh, my term of Service having expired,
      after three years Service from Oct 1861. on arriving at Washington I tried to find
      you
      but could not. when you first met me, on leaving you you gave me a small book of poems
      with your name in it, bidding me think of you. I stowed it away in my knapsack but
      loosing that I lost your gift. I would like a duplicate, if it is not presuming too
      much. I trust you will not think me forward in this. With many and kind regards
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thompson was perhaps H. B. Thompson, who also
      signs his name "Thomson." He wrote to Walt Whitman on : "You will not remember the writer of this letter. ...
      I wont forget Walt Whitman. I have just read that you have completed your half
      century. May you live to a ripe old age, loving and beloved. I was reading 'Drum
      Taps' last night, no man can depict Army life so vividly that had not spent his
      time amongst the boys." A Sergeant Hugh B. Thomson was enlisted the Third
      Company of the Seventh Regiment of New York during the Civil War.

   <p id="loc.00873_n1">1. Little is known about
      Charles String but he might have lived in Camden in the mid-1880s, as a local
      veteran's club (William B. Hatch Post No. 37 of the Grand Army of the Republic)
      lists a man by this name as one of its members in 1886.<a href="#r1">[back]
