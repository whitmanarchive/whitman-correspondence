      <br></br><br></br> My Dearest Friend:
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Those few words of yours to Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r1">1</a></sup> "tasted good" to us<sup><a href="#loc.05711_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—few, but enough, seeing that we can fill out
      between the lines with what you have given us of yourself forever &amp; always in
      your books—&amp; that is how I comfort myself for having so few letters. But I
      turn many wistful thoughts toward America, and were not I &amp; mine bound here by
      unseverable ties, did we not seem to grow &amp; belong here as by a kind of natural
      destiny that has to be fulfilled very cheerfully, could I make America my home for
      the sake of being near you in body as I am in heart &amp; soul—but Time has
      good things in store for us sooner or later, I doubt not. I could hardly express to
      you how welcome is the thought of death to me—not in the sense of any
      discontent with life—but as life with fresh energies &amp; wider horizon &amp;
      hand in hand again with those that are gone on first. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Herby found the little bit of gray cloth very useful—but one day <em>save him an
         old suit</em>. Your figure in the picture is, I think, a fair suggestion of one aspect of
      you; but not, could not of course be, an adequate portrait. He will never rest till
      he has done his best to achieve that. As soon as he can afford it (for it is a very
      slow business indeed for a young artist to make money in England, though when he
      does begin he is better paid than in America) he means to run over to see you. He
      says he should like always to spend his winters in New York. I say how very highly
      I
      prize that last slip you sent me, "A backward glance on my own road"?<sup><a href="#loc.01149_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> It both corroborates &amp; explains much that I feel
      very deeply.—If you are seeing Mrs. Whitman,<sup><a href="#n0368b" id="r4">4</a></sup> please say
      her letter was a pleasure &amp; that I shall write again before very long. I feel as
      if this letter would never find you—be sure &amp; let us know your
      whereabouts. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Remembrance &amp; love. </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
