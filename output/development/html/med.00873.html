      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I now send you on with loving remembrances &amp; good wishes our little contribution
      to the record of your birthday—a draft for $19495 (£ 40) from Bessie &amp;
      Isabella Ford,<sup><a href="#med.00873_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> William, Ethel &amp; Arthur Thompson<sup><a href="#med.00873_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; myself. I
      hope it will reach you safely—you might send a line in reply. The draft is
      payable at the Tradesman's National Bank, Phila.
   </p>
   
   <p>Glad that you notch another birthday among us—tho' I fear the time is often
      wearisome to you. The spring comes again with the cuckoo &amp; the corncrake calling
      all day long, &amp; the grass growing thick about our feet already (very early this
      year) and the trees all in leaf—the old vigor somewhere down, the perennial
      source which even in extreme age I guess people sometimes feel within them. I trust
      you have still good friends near you, and do not feel cut off from those that are
      remote. Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#n4152" id="r3">3</a></sup> has just sent me some lines or verses of
      greeting to you—but perhaps he will send them on himself. I heard from
      Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> a fortnight ago telling me he had been with you. I
      have just been weeding strawberries &amp; come in to write you these few lines.
   </p>
   
   <p>All goes well with me. I am brown, &amp; hardy—&amp; tho' I live mostly alone I
      have more friends almost than a man ought to have. Some kind of promise keeps
      floating to us always, luring us on. With much love to you, dear Walt,
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00873_n1">1.  Isabella Ford
      (1855–1924) was an English feminist, socialist, and writer. Elizabeth
      (Bessie) Ford was her sister. Both were introduced to Whitman's writings by
      Carpenter, and they quickly became admirers of the aged poet. The Ford sisters
      also helped form the Leeds Women's Suffrage Society. In 1875, Isabella Ford met Carpenter,
      who
      introduced her to socialism; they joined The Fabian Society in 1883.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="med.00873_n2">2. As yet we have no
      information on William, Ethel, and Arthur Thompson.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4152">3. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
