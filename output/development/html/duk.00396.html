      <br></br><br></br>Bro Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Han is certainly better, although fluctuating in her condition. I essayed to drive
      with her yesterday but was compelled
      to return. Some nights she does not sleep, at others sleeps well. She is about the
      house this morning: little appetite. She keeps your letters close by her: she cannot
      read much, or endure reading or talking. Dr Lund<sup><a href="#duk.00396_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>  is attending her steadily; he is a good physician:
      Asks no fee, but I shall pay him in my way. I have used a portion of the money sent to Han,
      which I shall repay—to help get a frame. I have numerous good paintings, but
      money is scarce. I have to meet my annual interest next [
      <span class="unclear">week?</span>]
       15 dollars; that paid I [
      <span class="unclear">shall?</span>]
       have a year before me to
      housekeeping.
   </p>
   
   <p>I washed our sheets yesterday, with Siddalls Soap<sup><a href="#duk.00396_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> nicely. I shall have a strange and
      instructing history to report some day probably, but I have saved in household
      service and other ways, over 60 dollars.
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall continue as I am[:] our condition, of course is current through the town.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a French-born
      landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman (1823–1890), Walt
      Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_96.html">Heyde, Charles Louis (1822–1892)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00396_n1">1. Dr. William B. Lund became
      Hannah Heyde's doctor after the former doctor, Samuel W. Thayer, had died. He
      remained the family's doctor until Hannah Heyde's death in 1908.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00396_n2">2. "Frank Siddalls Soap" was a
      laundry detergent widely advertised as a "Godsend to Housekeepers and Servant
      Girls" because it claimed to work "without boiling" (<em>Harper's
         Weekly</em> [2 February 1883], 79). Siddalls even sent out trial packages
      through the mail. On Siddalls's life and business ventures, see: "Some
      Interesting Episodes From the Career of the Late Frank Siddalls," <em>Trade: A Journal for Retail Merchants</em> 14 (Detroit, 1907),
