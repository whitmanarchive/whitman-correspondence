      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I received the book quite safely this morning,<sup><a href="#loc.04622_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp;
      thank you very much for sending it, it was a very good thought of Edward
      Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r2">2</a></sup> to ask you to send it to me, &amp; just like him
      to know how pleased I should be to receive it from your own hands. I do indeed feel
      proud to have it direct from the Author, &amp; to have my name written in it by
      himself. I should like to take this opportunity if you will allow me, of thanking
      you for all the help I have [illegible]
      &amp; do get, 
      from your books. You do not know me, I have never spoken one word to you til to-day,
      but I know you. You have spoken to me many words of help, &amp; encouragement &amp;
      reproof, &amp; direction, &amp; of all kinds &amp; I feel very grateful to you for
      them, &amp; for all the pleasure I have had in reading your books, &amp; I shall always be
      grateful to Mr Carpenter also, for introducing them to me. They contain messages for
      all times &amp; people, &amp; for all sorts &amp; conditions of men, but it seems to
      me they are especially good &amp; most glad tidings to common place,
      ordinary plain people, with few gifts
       &amp; no graces
      like myself. Also most truly a message of love &amp; tenderness &amp; sympathy to the despised
      &amp; downtrodden of the earth. I so
      often think of these words of yours, "Each belongs here or anywhere, just as much
      as
      the well off just as much as you Each has his or her place in the procession." I
      shall never forget how struck I was with the truth &amp; beauty of verses 16 17 &amp; 18 on
      page 105 in Leaves of
      Grass the first time I read them, it so often [
      <span class="unclear">came?</span>]
       to me as I [
      <span class="unclear">go?</span>]
       about amongst the sick &amp; poor, especially the poor in the Workhouse Hospital. That
      for many people there seems no place at all no one wants them  everyone seems glad when they drop
      out of the procession, &amp; yet most of those men &amp; women in the hospital, have
      worked hard much too hard as their bent backs declare, all their lives. There is something
      very very wrong somewhere &amp; we shall have to answer for it in one way or
      another, but I will not trouble you with more words of mine. Forgive me writing so
      much. I did not intend when I began. I should like to send the money for the book
      &amp; the postage, but I do not know the price of the book. Will you kindly send me
      the price on a post card. Again thanking you I am 
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04622_n1">1. In his notebook, Whitman
      records on July 10 1884: "sent <u>Specimen Days</u> to Anna M
      Wilkinson, 12 Bootham Terrace, York, England . . . for Edward Carpenter" (<em>Daybooks and Notebooks</em>, ed. William White, 2:337).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0141b">2. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
