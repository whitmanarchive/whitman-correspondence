      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yesterday I gave a letter of introduction to you to a lady friend of mine, Miss Helen
      Moore. Miss Moore was speaking to me of your poetry yesterday as she and I were
      walking through the galleries of the Louvre, she is an intellectual lady and she
      admires  a great
      deal you have written, she enjoyed so much your lecture on the assassination of
      Lincoln. She leaves Paris for her home in Philadelphia in a few weeks, stopping at
      London on her way. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Miss Moore has just had her first book published, "Mary Wolstonecraft
      Shelley" and I think you would feel that it was well written if you should read
      it.<sup><a href="#loc.02363_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I feel sure you will  find pleasure in Miss Moore's company for she is very
      appreciative. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I was more than pleased to receive the papers you sent me in which I found so much
      about you. I am sorry I could not have heard the lecture on Lincoln, there is a
      spirit and movement to your work that I feel directly. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you are better and able to get about without trouble.  If you can find time and strength
      to write me even a line I shall be much pleased. There is something about a written
      word from one that brings more happiness than anything excepting the person himself.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Again many thanks for the papers and I trust that the letter of introduction I gave
      to Miss Moore will be agreeable to you and you will not feel I have taken too much
      liberty. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Percy Ives, grandson of
      Elisa Leggett, was an aspiring artist who made several pencil sketches of
      Whitman on December 21, 1881. They resulted in the oil painting now in the
      Feinberg Collection (Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On , Whitman wrote to Percy in answer
      to a letter now lost. See Charles E. Feinberg, "Percy Ives, Detroit and Walt
