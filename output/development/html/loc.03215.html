   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0248">1. Ferdinand Freiligrath (1810–1876) was a German
      poet and translator and friend of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In his  letter to Rudolf Schmidt, Whitman
      wrote that Freiligrath "translates &amp; commends my poems." His review in the
      Augsburg <em>Allgemeinen Zeitung</em> on April 24, 1868 (reprinted
      in his <em>Gesammelte Dichtungen</em> [Stuttgart: G. J. Göschen,
      1871], 4:86–89), was among the first notices of Whitman's poetry on the
      continent. A translation of the article appeared in the <em>New
         Eclectic Magazine</em>, 2 (July 1868), 325–329; see also Gay Wilson
      Allen, <em>Walt Whitman Abroad</em> (Syracuse: Syracuse University
      Press, 1955), 3–7. A digital version is available in Walter Grünzweig's
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/german/introduction.html">Whitman in the German-Speaking Countries</a>," which collects several
      examples of German reception of Whitman's poetry. Freiligrath had promised his
      readers "some translated specimens of the poet's productions," not a complete
      translation. William D. O'Connor and Whitman were applying pressure. A
      sympathetic article on Whitman in the New York <em>Sontagsblatt</em> of November 1, 1868, mentioned Freiligrath's admiration
      for the American poet. A translation of this article, which Whitman had a
      Washington friend prepare, is now in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.<a href="#r1">[back]
