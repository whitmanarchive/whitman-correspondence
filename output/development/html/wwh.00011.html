      <br></br><br></br>Dear Hattie<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n0706" id="r1">1</a></sup>,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received your letter, &amp; read it over &amp; over again<sup><a href="#wwh.00011_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—it is very, very good—so much about your dear mother<sup><a href="#n0705" id="r3">3</a></sup>, it
      brought the tears to my eyes, &amp; I had to stop many times—my dear, dear Sister
      Martha<sup><a href="#n0707" id="r4">4</a></sup>, she must have suffered so much, &amp; to keep up such fortitude &amp; patience &amp;
      even cheerfulness, while life lasted—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Hattie, I have just got a letter from your grandmother written Thursday afternoon,
      Feb.
      27,<sup><a href="#wwh.00011_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; she had not got your letter then—did you send
      her one a week ago, as you spoke of having written to her? She was very uneasy at
      not
      hearing from Jeff<sup><a href="#n0710" id="r6">6</a></sup> or any of you, since your mother's death. I wish you to write <em>immediately</em> to your grandmother, direct to her
      <br><br>care of Geo. Whitman
      <br>at Starr's foundry
      <br>Camden, N. Jersey
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have got just well enough to go out, in a carriage, but, dear Hattie, I am in a
      miserable
      condition, as to my power of moving—The doctor says I shall get well, but it is very,
      very slow and irksome—my mind is clear, but I have to sit in my room alone, by the
      fire, most of the time—visitors generally have been prohibited—but only a few
      come in—but now I have ventured out for a few minutes every fair day—It is now
      afternoon, very pleasant, &amp; I shall just get out on the sidewalk &amp; then
      back—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>O how often I have thought of my dear sister Martha, as I have been alone here, both
      night
      &amp; day—I think of your father too, &amp; of you &amp; California<sup><a href="#wwh.00011_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup>—but here I am, unable to move—I hope Jeff will feel
      like writing to mother, &amp; she will send it to me—As soon as I can travel I think
      of going on to Camden—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dearest Hattie, if we had a house to invite you and California to, how much comfort
      it
      would be to your grandmother &amp; me—But I have great thoughts—at any rate a
      great desire—to get one,<sup><a href="#wwh.00011_n4" id="r8">8</a></sup> here, when I get well, &amp; have
      grandmother &amp; Eddy<sup><a href="#n0699" id="r9">9</a></sup> here—&amp; then you &amp; California shall
      surely come—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Love to you, dearest Hattie—&amp; love to your dear father, &amp; to
      California—If you can, dear niece, write me again, &amp; 
      dont
      
       wait very long, dear Hattie—Hattie dear, you must mind the address—(My
      letters from St. Louis are addressed wrong)—My right address is

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0706">1. Manahatta Whitman (1860–1886), known as
      "Hattie," was the daughter of Thomas Jefferson ("Jeff") and Martha ("Mattie")
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and sister-in-law. Hattie and her sister Jessie
      were both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="wwh.00011_n1">2. Mannahatta informed her grandmother on
      February 27, 1873, that she had written seven pages to Walt Whitman—"the
      longest letter I have ever written" (Library of Congress). Walt Whitman,
      obviously pleased with the letter, sent it to Hannah, who on March 5, 1873,
      (Library of Congress) forwarded it to her mother.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0705">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0707">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman (d. 1873) known as "Mattie,"
      was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and
      Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
      the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat
      ailment that would lead to her death in 1873.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="wwh.00011_n2">5. On February 27, 1873, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman wrote about her uneasiness both to  and to Jeff (Northwestern University).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0710">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890), known as
      "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
      eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
      recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
      marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
      correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
      together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Matty) in 1873 and
      his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
      his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!" For
      more on Thomas Jefferson Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="wwh.00011_n3">7. Manahatta sister, Jessie Louisa.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="wwh.00011_n4">8. Walt Whitman had also expressed desire to
      purchase a home in Washington in his , , and  letters to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0699">9. Edward Whitman (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or
      "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. He required lifelong
      assistance for significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in
      the care of his mother until her death. His brother George Washington Whitman
      cared for him for most of the rest of his life, with financial support from Walt
      Whitman. For more information on Eddy, see Randall Waldron, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_221.html">Whitman, Edward (1835–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r9">[back]
