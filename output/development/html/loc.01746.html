      <br></br>Camden,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Friday afternoon <br xmlns="" class="opener">Aug. 1.
      
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear son,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter is rec'd to-day, and enclosed I send you $20—I want you to write soon—as
      I shall want to know if it reached you safe.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am feeling relieved of the worst distress in the head, now for the last two days—had
      it straight along bad enough the first three days in the week—but yesterday 
      &amp; to-day it has mostly let up—have been out to-day, &amp; over to Philadelphia—it is hard
      work, especially as I have no one to go with me—but I put a bold face on, 
      <u>&amp; my best foot foremost</u>—Is Wash Milburn there in the store? or has he gone on his vacation 
      in the country?—answer me in your next—I think of writing a few lines to him—Hot weather
      here, but I don't suffer much from it—though I think it is bad for me, 
      &amp; I hope much more from the cool season, if I get through this—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete I too see quite a good deal of <u>Railroad</u>, &amp; hear more—some 70 rods off 
      is the great depot of the Camden &amp; Amboy, bells &amp; whistles &amp; trains rumbling continually,
      
      night &amp; day, &amp; lots of RR men living near, around here—if I only felt just 
      
      a little better, 
      I should get acquainted with many of the men, which I could very easily do if I would
      I should like much to go on the trips so handy &amp; cheap, right as you might say from
      my door, 
      to Cape May, or to Long Branch, &amp;c. to say nothing of the numerous fine jaunts 
      from Philadelphia by RR. or up or down the Delaware by steamboat—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—If you was only here to convoy me—but I suppose no one is to have <u>every thing</u> wanting—(Pete, dear son, there was $89 coming to you, of the money you put in my
      charge, 
      &amp; now there will be $69 yet due you from me—your own soap)—As I write, 
      it is 4½ o'clock Friday afternoon—I am sitting here alone, in the 2d story front room—every thing quiet here—I rec'd the other letter, &amp; Sunday Chronicle—when
      you write, 
      tell me who you see, &amp; every thing,—I like such letters far better than the formal
      ones some send me—I had a visit from a good, kind-hearted, rather queer old fellow
      named Ingram,<sup><a href="#loc.01746_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> from Philadelphia—he said he see in the Phil. paper I was laid up very sick in Camden—so he came over, &amp; hunted for hours through
      the hot sun, found me at last—he evidently had thought I was keeled up, &amp; hard up,
      &amp; he came to offer help—he has been a great traveler, is English by birth—I found
      him good company, 
      &amp; was glad to see him—he has been twice—so you see there are good souls left—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Pete when you see Judge Fisher<sup><a href="#loc.01746_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> tell him I shall yet be back all right one of these days, 
      &amp; in the mean time tell him I send him my love—also my love to Mr &amp; Mrs. Nash 
      the next time you go there—so good by for the present my darling son, 
      &amp; you must keep good heart, for I do, though it is pretty glum around &amp; over me sometimes
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>Pete you must read this over Sunday, as a ten minutes' talk like, about all sorts
      of odds &amp; ends

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01746_n1">1. William Ingram kept a tea
      store in Philadelphia. To Horace Traubel, Whitman observed: "He is a man of the
      Thomas Paine stripe—full of benevolent impulses, of radicalism, of the
      desire to alleviate the sufferings of the world—especially the sufferings
      of prisoners in jails, who are his protégés" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 9 vols.,
      1:185).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.01746_n2">2. George P. Fisher
      (1817–1899) served in the House of Representatives from 1860 to 1862, and
      was appointed by Lincoln in 1863 to the Supreme Court of the District of
      Columbia. He presided at the trial of John H. Surratt, which Whitman described
      in a letter to Alfred Pratt of .
      Fisher left the bench in 1870 to become District Attorney of the District of
      Columbia.<a href="#r2">[back]
