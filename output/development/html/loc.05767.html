      <br></br><br></br>My Dearest Friend:
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Your card<sup><a href="#loc.05767_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> (your very voice &amp; touch, drawing me
      across the Atlantic close beside you) was put into my hand just as I was busy
      copying out "With husky, haughty lips O sea" to pin into my "Leaves of Grass." I
      hardly think there is anything grander there. I think surely they must see that that
      is the very Soul of Nature uttering itself sublimely. 
   </p> 
   
   <p> Who do you think came to see us on Sunday? Professor Dowden.<sup><a href="#loc.05767_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> And I know not when I have set eyes on a more beautiful
      personality. I think you would be as much attracted towards him as I was. It was he
      who told me (full of enthusiasm) of the Poems in <em>Harper's</em> which I had not seen or
      heard of.<sup><a href="#loc.05767_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> We had a very happy two or three hours together, talking of you &amp;
      looking through Blake's drawings. He is a tall man, complexion tanned &amp; healthy,
      nose finely modelled, dark eyes with plenty of life &amp; meaning in them, hair
      grayish—I should think he was between forty &amp; fifty—but says his
      father is still a fine hale old man. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r4">4</a></sup> disappointed again this year of getting anything into the
      R. Academy. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I think I like the idea of the shanty, if you have any one to take good care of you,
      to cook nicely, keep all neat &amp; clean &amp;c. I wonder if I have ever been in
      Mickle St. I, still busy, still hammering away to see if I can help those that
      "balk" at "Leaves of Grass". Perhaps you will smile at me—at any rate it bears
      good fruit to me—I seem to be in a manner living with you the while. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Everything full of beauty just now here, as no doubt it is with you. </p>
   
   <p> Good-bye, dearest friend—don't forget the letter that is to come soon. Love
      from us all, love &amp; again love from 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
