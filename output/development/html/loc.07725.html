   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      being the only recorded sitting vice president to shoot and kill someone while
      in office as well as being arrested on charges of treason in a conspiracy to
      capitalize on a possible war in Spain (Mark O. Hatfield, with the Senate

   <p id="n0915">5. Franklin B. Sanborn
      (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
      he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
      the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
      reviewed <em>Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Boston
         Commonwealth</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00059.html">February 24, 1866</a>. He was editor of the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
      his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
      appeared without Sanborn's name in the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K. Walker,

   <p id="n4267">6. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="loc.07725_n6">11. Robert Burns (1759–1796) 
      is remembered best as the national bard of Scotland. His poetry
      and use of the Scots dialect made him the first poet in the English-speaking world
      to be 
      treated as a national celebrity in his lifetime, and he is
      often viewed as the first of the English-speaking Romantic poets. His political and
      religious 
      views were seen as controversial, and after his
      death he became a source of inspiration for liberalism and socialism (Robert Crawford,

   <p id="loc.07725_n7">12. Mary Stuart (1542–1587), also known as Mary, 
      Queen of Scots and Mary I of Scotland, ruled over Scotland from 1542–1567 when she
      was imprisoned 
      and forced to abdicate the throne to her one-year-old son. When she escaped to England
      to seek
      refuge, her Catholicism and potential claim to the English throne were viewed as threatening
      and 
      caused her to be confined in various castles by her cousin, Queen Elizabeth I of England.
      After eighteen 
      and a half years of confinement she was found guilty of involvement in a plot to assassinate
      the Queen and was
      executed (John Guy, <em>Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary
         Stuart</em> [New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004]).<a href="#r12">[back]
