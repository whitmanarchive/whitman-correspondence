   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07045_n1">1. 1885 appears to be a
      plausible date for the following reasons: Whitman was contemplating on , a "sort of resume &amp; talk in
      general" as part of the next edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      (1313 [III]); he complained of "unconsciousness, falling &amp;c" on  (1313 [III]); and he wrote about the
      German translation of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> to Karl Knortz on
       (1313 [III]) and again on
      September 10 (1344). In addition, he wrote "Booth and 'The Bowery' " (1288, n.
      52 [III]), which appeared in the New York <em>Tribune</em> on
      August 16, 1885, and "Abraham Lincoln" (1357 [III]), which was printed in Rice's
      <em>Reminiscences of Abraham Lincoln</em> (1886). Furness
      assumes that this draft is part of the draft letter to Rolleston on  (1287 [III]). The difficulty with
      this date is that the first sentence of the draft in question appears to
      indicate some lapse of time in the correspondence. Whitman wrote to Rolleston on
      April 22(?), , and ; but apparently he did not write again
      for a number of years. Although the poet complained of a possible "total and
      permanent loss of walking power" on  (1291 [III]), he was evidently not planning a new edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> at the time. However, he was collecting
      material for articles on Father Taylor (1291 [III]) and Edwin Booth
      (1288–1289 [III]). The former did not appear until 1887, and the latter,
      as noted earlier, was printed in 1886.<a href="#r1">[back]
