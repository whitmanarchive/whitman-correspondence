      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just received your letter of the 7th inst. I appreciate your kindness in the
      matter of the poem.<sup><a href="#col.00003_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I
      send herewith a verbatim copy of Emerson's note,<sup><a href="#col.00003_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> as
      requested.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing very new or special with me, these days. I am well as usual—am still
      employed in the Attorney General's Office. A new edition of my book will be printed
      this fall, with another small volume in prose.<sup><a href="#col.00003_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> You shall have
      early copies, may-be in sheets.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Farewell for the present. I send you my love—Write whenever you can.</p>
