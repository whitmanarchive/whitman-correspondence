      wounded he was carried through the lines of our Regt. It was very discouraging to
      us as we lay on the hill to see hundreds of men leave their regiments without being
      hurt at all and some 2 or 300 wounded were either carried or walked through our ranks
      going to the rear. I think we was completely out generald<sup><a href="#duk.00326_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> &nbsp;the most of our men was good enough but I think that they was badly handled. Mother
      I have just received a letter from you dated August 16th which is the only word I
      have had from home since we left Fredericksburg. We shall probably encamp here for
      a few days to recruit up a little and I hope you will write to me as soon as you get
      this. Mother do not feel the least uneaisiness about me as&nbsp;I never was heartier or ruggeder in my life. I am getting tired so good
      bye to all &nbsp;I will write again soon<sup><a href="#duk.00326_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00326_n2">1. George R. Davey, Captain
      of Company H, and George Mallory, Captain of Company B, both of the
      Eighty-Fourth Regiment of Infantry, died in battle on August 29, 1862, at
      Groveton, Virginia.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00326_n3">2. First Lieutenant Josiah
      M. Grummond, Company H of the same regiment, was wounded in action on August 29,
      1862, at Groveton, Virginia. He died of his wounds on September 9, 1862, at
      Washington, D.C.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00326_n4">3. This remark is especially
      significant in placing the letter soon after the Second Battle of Bull Run, for
      historians agree that this Union defeat was owing to the tactical errors of
      General John Pope, and not to any lack of troop morale. Additionally, George's
      mention of having received a letter from his mother dated August 16, 1862—the
      first from home since his regiment moved up from Fredericksburg—seems, at the
      very least, to place this fragment in the early part of September 1862.It is
      interesting to note that Walt Whitman shared his brother's disappointment in the
      Union military leaders. Concerning the <em>first</em> battle of
      Bull Run, he wrote this description of the Union officers who had returned to
      Washinton after the battle: "The principal hotel, Willard's, is full of
      shoulder-straps—thick, crush'd, creeping with shoulder-straps. (I see them, and
      must have a word with them. There you are, shoulder-straps!—but where are your
      companies? where are your men? Incompetents! never tell me of chances of battle,
      of getting stray'd, and the like. I think this is your work, this retreat, after
      all. Sneak, blow, put on airs there in Willard's sumptuous parlors and
      bar-rooms, or anywhere—no explanation shall save you. Bull Run is your work; had
      you been half or one-tenth worthy of your men, this would never have happen'd.)"

   <p id="duk.00326_n100">5. This undated fragment was
      probably written soon after George Washington Whitman's letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman from ; it appears to
      dwell on the same subject: the results of a battle that included the Fourteenth
      New York State Militia (Eighty-Fourth Regiment of Infantry). In fact, it may
      well be the last part of the letter of —which lacks a closing signature.<a href="#r5">[back]
