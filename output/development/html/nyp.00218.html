   </p> 
   
   <p>I write these few lines to you in order that you may know where I am and also that
      I am in the enjoyment of middling good health I heard from you through my Father some
      time ago and I have wanted to visit you but I am sorry to say my health will not admit
      of my being out much this cold weather. If you remember I was wounded through my lung
      and the ball is now near my right kidney and I am not as healthy as I use to be before
      I was wounded.
   </p>  
   
   <p>I feel quite well to day I have just received a letter from my Brother in my Regt
      (15th nj) he spoke of you. I wrote him concerning you and he says he would like to
      see you. I think I owe you a thousand thanks for your kindness to me while in Hospt
      at Washington. I have often thought of you and wished I could hear from you. I would
      like to hear from that Lady who did so much for me. I think it was Miss Howard. I
      think I will be well enough to come and see you in a week or two—and then we will
      talk over all the incidents of our short acquaintance in Washington. If you will answer
      this and set the day I will come and see you. I am a little deaf now from the earache
      but I hope we will get along with that. Hoping to hear from you soon I subscribe myself
      yours faithfully
   </p>

      Mullery, Company K, Fifteenth New Jersey, was in Ward A, Armory Square Hospital,
      on May 14, 1864. The twenty-year-old boy had been "shot through shoulder, ball
      in lung—(ball still probably near lung)—lost right finger." On June 23, 1864, he
      went home to Vernon, New Jersey, on furlough, and then served as assistant cook
      in the army hospital in Newark. He was still at the Newark hospital on January
