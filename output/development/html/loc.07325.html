   <p>It is after tea (7 P.M.), I am over in my office—gas lit, blinds drawn down,
      quite snug. Received today "Le Temps"<sup><a href="#loc.07730_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> and your
      letter enclosing Kennedy's<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r2">2</a></sup> note all welcome. Do not be uneasy about Mrs
      Costelloe,<sup><a href="#loc.07730_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> she is young and strong and will
      rally—will probably be better than ever in a year from now and will know
      enough to keep well next time. If I saw the least prospect of her not recovering I
      should feel it a terrible calamity—but I do not—she will get well all
      right—do not be uneasy about that. All well here and all going right. No
      further word from Willy Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r4">4</a></sup> but I look for him here within the
      next 2 or 3 weeks without fail. I note what Kennedy says about the publication
      of the book<sup><a href="#owu.00013_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> (his "W.W.") as soon as I get a few hundred that
      I can spar[e]<sup><a href="#loc.07730_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> (and I look for that time to come ve[ry]
      [so]on now) it is my intention to ad[van]ce the funds required for I am [?]
      [a]nxious to have K's book pu[blished] and so made safe—put on [?] for good.
      [mutilation] I have ma[n]y other schemes to go into when the needfull is
      forthcoming—I am not in a hurry (there is no hurry) if I live I shall see some
      of them through yet—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Who fights for the truth has strong backers—I am not uneasy—we shall
      certainly come out O.K. in the end

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07730_n1">1. <em>Le

   <p id="n3039">2. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

   <p id="n4284">4. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="owu.00013_n2">5. Kennedy wrote on : "Fred. Wilson writes me that if he
      publishes I must pay cost of production. I can't, so I write him to return the
      MS. to me. I must wait till I get able." Richard Maurice Bucke, to whom Whitman
      sent Kennedy's note, promised on  that
      if the meter paid off he would "ad[vance] the funds required, for I am [most?]
      anxious to have K's book pub[lished] and so made safe." On January 28, 1891,
      Kennedy informed Bucke that Wilson had not returned his manuscript: "He has
      about $200 at least subscribed. I recently wrote him again, asking him if he wd
      like to bring out the 1st half, &amp; let the Concordance slide."<a href="#r5">[back]
