   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The editor of <em>The Century</em> at this time was Richard Watson Gilder
      (1844–1909). Whitman had met Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H.
      Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1955], 482), and considered Gilder one of the
      "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art delirium" (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">Sunday, August 5, 1888</a>). For more about Gilder, see Susan L.
      Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_95.html">Gilder, Richard Watson (1844–1909)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). As this letter indicates, in the 1880s <em>The Century</em> published a series of articles about the
      American Civil War.
