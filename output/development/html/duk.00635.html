   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00635_n14">1. This letter dates to
      between December 15 and 19, 1868; the earlier dates are somewhat more probable.
      Richard Maurice Bucke, on an accompanying slip of paper held in the Trent
      Collection (not reproduced here), dated this letter mid-December 1868. Edwin
      Haviland Miller assigned the date December 14? (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:366). Based on the letter's reference to the death of DeWitt
      C. Enos, a Brooklyn physician, which the <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Eagle</em> reported on December 15, the date range for the letter can be
      narrowed to a range shortly after Enos's death, though probably not as early as
      that proposed by Miller. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman tended to share Brooklyn news
      with Walt Whitman promptly, so it is unlikely that the letter dates to more than
      three or four days after the December 15 report of Enos's death. Randall H.
      Waldron also assigned "mid-December" as the date for the departure of Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman and family to St. Louis, though Waldron's date may rely in
      part on Miller's date (<em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 60).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00575_n9">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
      adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
      he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
      St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Jeff
      Whitman. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta "Hattie"
      (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" (b. 1863). In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to join Jeff after he had assumed the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in 1867. For more on Mattie, see
      the introduction to Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00635_n15">4. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      complains, but her complaint has an element of bitter humor that would have been
      recognizable to her son Walt Whitman. The $100 amount is an echo of Mattie
      Whitman's complaint from a little over a month earlier: Jeff Whitman's check
      from the Metropolitan Board of Health was $100 short of the amount that Mattie
      had anticipated (see Louisa's 
      letter to Walt). Even if one finds sardonic humor in Louisa's echo of the amount
      that frustrated Mattie, her complaint over Jeff and Mattie's spendthrift ways
      reflects her recognition that she lived in comparative poverty. From her
      perspective, Jeff's earnings at the St. Louis Water Works were beyond
      comprehension: "mr lane told george they had raised Jeffs salary to 6000 but i
      think it must be a mistake" (see her 
      letter to Walt).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00635_n13">5. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a French-born landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa
      Whitman (1823–1908), Walt Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington,
      Vermont. The relationship between Hannah and Charles was difficult and marred
      with quarrels and disease. Charles was infamous among the Whitmans for his often
      offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00635_n12">6. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided in Burlington,
      Vermont, with husband Charles L. Heyde, a landscape painter. Hannah in November
      had suffered a serious thumb infection that led Dr. Samuel Thayer to lance her
      wrist. In early December, Thayer amputated Hannah's thumb. For Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's report on the initial surgery from a non-extant letter by Charles L.
      Heyde, see her 
      letter to Walt Whitman. For the surgical amputation of Hannah's thumb, see
      Charles Heyde's early December letter to Louisa (Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G.
      Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of
         Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University
      Press, 1949], 225). Edwin Haviland Miller dated Charles Heyde's letter to
      "[a]bout December 8" (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>,
      ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:73, n. 37).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00635_n1">7.  See "The Sudden Death of
      Dr. DeWitt C. Enos" (<em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, December 15,
      1868, 2). Walt Whitman had attempted to consult Enos on Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman's throat condition. Satisfied after a meeting with Dr. A. C. Wilson, he
      decided not to consult Enos (see Walt's  letter to Thomas Jefferson Whitman). According to Enos's death
      notice, he was aged 45 years, resided at Clinton Street near Fulton Avenue,
      graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, and had
      served both as a visiting surgeon in the City Hospital and as a professor of
      anatomy in the Long Island College Hospital.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n5">8. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
      later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
      Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
      pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
      correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
      poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
