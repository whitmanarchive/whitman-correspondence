      <br></br><br></br>Dear E.C.,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I thought I would write you a line once more, but no particular news to send.
      Everything goes on much in the old way (and always has, and always will, I reckon,
      in this old world).
   </p>
   
   <p>I am alive, and here, in the same locality, but pretty feeble. Wanted to thank you
      again, and more specifically, dear E.C., for the help you have so kindly sent
      me—you and my dear friends the two Misses Ford,<sup><a href="#loc.01238_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> to
      whom I send thanks and love.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just had my dinner, (buckwheat cakes, and tea, good). I am sitting here in
      the
      little front room downstairs writing this. Always love. Write.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01238_n2">1. Isabella Ford
      (1855–1924) was an English feminist, socialist, and writer. Elizabeth
      (Bessie) Ford was her sister. Both were introduced to Whitman's writings by
      Edward Carpenter and they quickly became admirers of the aged poet.<a href="#r1">[back]
