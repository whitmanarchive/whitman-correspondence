      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have weathered it out pretty well this week—at present moment am sitting here cover'd with sweat, with nothing on 
      but shirt &amp; pants—to-day &amp; yesterday the very <u>hottest kind</u>—I suppose you have it too.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Pete there is nothing new in my case, &amp; no prospect more than usual of anything <u>sudden</u>—but it seems pretty clear 
      that there is no substantial recovery probable, (hardly possible,) for me—how long
      it will last this way it is 
      of course impossible to tell—I take it all without growling—things are steadily growing worse with me—But I must not worry you—&amp; may-be there is something more favorable
      ahead—I busy myself a little every day writing—I want to fix my books in a little
      better shape, this summer—partly busy with a new volume—so that they will all be comprised
      in Two Vols.—(not very much really new matter, but some)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So you dont come on to Balt, now, (as I take it from your last)—Love to you, dear son.</p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Love to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nash—do you ever see Mrs. O'Connor or Eldridge?—Is Tasistro still
      around?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
