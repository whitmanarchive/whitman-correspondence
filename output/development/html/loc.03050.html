      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I never meant my last poor postal to be the answer to yr kind page-letter. And now
      that I am taking a vacation of six weeks to write the bk I told you of, I must bore
      you with a letter—just to say how'd'e, + to tell you that my staunch little
      dame, my brave frau-[illegible] is going to
      make a little visiting tour, + will some day make you a little call 
      <p>(second reading: a profusion of "littles"
         in here by mistake!)
      </p> (in abt' two
      <p>2</p> weeks) if agreeable. She is of the cheery-shy kind,
      + will do you good. But if it shd so happen that you sh<u>d</u>
      not feel like seeing anybody on the day she comes, she wants me to say that she will
      not feel in the least grudgy—any more than I shall, [
      <span class="unclear">ever?</span>]
      , if I shall happen
      to knock at yr door on the wrong day.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I feel like myself again, now I am out for a vacation—like a man escaped fr.
      the penitentiary. I inquired at the stores for <u>Liberty</u>,
      but it is not to be had at any of the news stands in Boston.
      <p>no satire intended! (second reading of this
         [illegible]
      </p> I will stop in to
      see "Ben" himself next time I go in.—Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r1">1</a></sup> has not
      written me for some time. I miss his letters.
   </p>
   
   <p>Hooray! for my freedom! [Here I cut a caper] Now for six weeks of <u>thought</u>.
   </p>
   
   <p>I wrote to F. Wilson<sup><a href="#loc.03316_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> yesterday, asking him to either
      report on <u>MS</u>. or return to me.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I feel that I have broadened + deepened my knowledge of human nature amazingly by
      the
      past two years of shoulder to shoulder work with the (to me) [illegible] hitherto unfamiliar class of skilled city mechanics
      (+ proof-readers). I feel much stronger in digestion + in sinew, + in character;
      self-reliant: nothing like it: to be able to snap yr fingers at cant, compromise,
      the sneaks of the profession, + c.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Our kitten is lovely: I have propagated, from the <u>slips</u>,
      ten new choice roses, + they are now 5 inches high. My gloire di Dijon rose has
      grown 12 feet high in many rigorous shoots.
   </p>
   
   <p>Have you got hold of those D'Artagnan romances of Dumas? I think you w<u>d</u> find them a good anodyne—almost as good as
      Scott.<sup><a href="#n4277" id="r3">3</a></sup> Manly adventure is the theme—and love. But <u>especially</u> embodied <u>comradeship</u>:
      it is yr calamus doctrine embodied in a faint + inferior degree (the Gallic nature
      is not so <u>deep</u> in the affectional nature as the German you
      know)
   </p>

      good by dear friend, + much love fr yrs always

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4267">1. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

      British edition of <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n4277">3. Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832)

      for <em>Ivanhoe</em> (1820), <em>The Lady of the
         Lake</em> (1810), and <em>Waverly</em> (1814). For more on
