   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4140">2. Dr. John Kearsley Mitchell II
      (1859–1935) was the son of S. Weir Mitchell, the noted American physician
      and writer of historical fiction; the young Mitchell looked in on Whitman when
      his regular physician, William Osler, was unavailable. Whitman was not overly
      impressed with the Mitchells: "The young man Mitchell did not take me by
      storm—he did not impress me. I start off with a prejudice against doctors
      anyway. I know J. K.'s father somewhat—Weir: he is of the intellectual
      type—a scholar, writer, and all that: very good—an adept: very
      important in his sphere—a little bitter I should say—a little
      bitter—touched just a touch by the frosts of culture, society,
      worldliness—as how few are not!" (Horace Traubel With
      Walt Whitman in Camden, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.106.html">Thursday, July 12, 1888</a>).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n0817">3. Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:

   <p id="n0301">4. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker from Long
      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his
      influence on Whitman, see David S. Reynolds, <em>Walt Whitman's

   <p id="loc.07486_n2">5. Whitman described his nurse,
      W. A. Musgrove, as "kind active &amp; considerate all through" (See the letter

   <p id="loc.03310_n1">6. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
