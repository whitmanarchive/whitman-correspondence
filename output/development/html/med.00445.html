      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#med.00445_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing very notable to write about, but I thought I would send you a line—This is
      one of my 
      comfortable days—good night's sleep last night—breakfast &amp; dinner to-day with appetite—still
      get out 
      a little most every day as formerly—my <em>book business</em>, &amp; a little writing &amp; reading give me three hours 
      or so occupation (lazily) every day when I am not <em>too ill</em>—and then <em>the baby</em>, my brother's 6 mo's infant boy, 
      very fine &amp; bright (of course) is an unfailing delight &amp; diversion to me—the young
      one knows 
      me <em>so well</em>, &amp; is never so happy as when I am tending him.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I adopted your suggestion of 3 or 4 weeks since—wrote with result as follows to
      <br><br>
      <span>Wm Swinton—no answer</span><br>
      <span>to E C Stedman, sent an order at once enc'g: $30</span><br>
      <span>to J Q A Ward,<sup><a href="#med.00445_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> kind answer, will order presently</span><br>
      <span>to Dr Seeger, answer, order 1 set, &amp; money enc.</span><br>
      <span>to Joaquin Miller,<sup><a href="#med.00445_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> ordered a set &amp; sent the money.</span><br>
      <span>to Mr. Jardine, answered a few days ago</span><br>
      <br>
      I <em>did not write</em> either to G. A. Townsend,<sup><a href="#med.00445_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> or to W C Church<sup><a href="#med.00445_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> —have not sent the [<em>incomplete</em>]<sup><a href="#med.00445_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00445_n1">1. Edwin Haviland Miller's
      transcription was derived from G. M. Williamson, <em>Catalogue of
         A Collection of Books, Letters and Manuscripts written by Walt Whitman</em>
      (Jamaica, New York: The Marion Press, 1903), 28.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00445_n2">2. Whitman's  letter to John Swinton confirms that
      the recipient of this letter was John Swinton, who ordered books on April 24,
      1876.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00445_n3">3. For Ward, see Whitman's  letter.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00445_n4">4. Whitman also wrote about
      Miller's book order in his  letter
      to John H. Johnston.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00445_n5">5. George A. Townsend
      (1841–1914), a journalist who contributed to the New York <em>Herald</em> and to the Chicago <em>Tribune</em>.
      See also Whitman's  letter to William
      D. O'Connor. Probably because of Townsend's affiliation, Whitman sent "Song of
      the Exposition" to the Chicago <em>Tribune</em> on this date
      (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On May 10, 1876, the
      newspaper returned the manuscript because it arrived too late for
      publication.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00445_n6">6. The editor of the <em>Galaxy</em>; see Whitman's  letter to Church.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00445_n7">7. Only the first page of
      the letter is reproduced by Williamson. Whitman, after noting receipt of $50
      from Swinton for five sets of books on May 4, 1876, sent two additional volumes
      on May 6, 1876 (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r7">[back]
