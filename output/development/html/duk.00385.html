   </p>
   
   <p>As you requested me to write you after leaving the Hospital. I will do so for the
      first
      time. My wishes are that this may find you enjoying good health and plenty of kind
      friends to associate with.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have not been over to Armory Square Hospital<sup><a href="#n0043" id="r1">1</a></sup> since 
      leaveing
      
       it—. But have been expecting to call there and also to see you The
      orders here are very strict no one is allowed out side of Camp without a pass and
      the
      passes are 
      scarse
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall manage to see you before I leave for the front if possible We are to get our
      horses in a day or so, and then be off to 
      joine
      
       our Regiments
   </p>
   
   <p>The News are dull concerning the movements of the Army but for all that we expect
      to
      hear of a hard fought Battle before long. I think that we will be sent out as 
      reenforcements
      
       so much the better
   </p>
   
   <p>Now Uncle I hope you will not believe that I had or have 
      forgoten
      
       you. I will write again when at the front &amp; perhaps have something more
      worth writing about. I will close by expecting to have a better opportunity of writing
      some thing else when you hear from me again My health is good at present
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>"Little Mitch," or Reuben Farwell (1843–1926),
      served with the Michigan Cavalry during the War and met Walt Whitman in Armory
      Square Hospital early in 1864; upon his release from the hospital he
      corresponded with Whitman. After Farwell received his discharge on August 24,
      1864, he returned to his home in Plymouth, Mich. Evidently the correspondence
      was renewed when Walt Whitman sent a post card (now lost) on February 5, 1875.
      On , Farwell, who owned a farm in
      Michigan, wrote: "Walt my dear old Friend how I would like to grasp your hand
      and give you a kiss as I did in the days of yore. what a satisfaction it would
      be to me." In Farwell's last letter, on , he said that he was planning to leave shortly for California.
      Eleven letters from Farwell are in the Trent Collection, Duke University. He is
      mentioned in "Memoranda During the War"; see <em>The Complete
         Writings of Walt Whitman</em> (1902), 10 vols., IV, 134.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0043">1. Armory Square Hospital was the hospital Walt Whitman
      most frequently visited in Washington, D.C. during the Civil War. Because of
      Armory Square's location near a steamboat landing and railroad, it received the
      bulk of serious casualties from Virginia battlefields. At the end of the war it
      recorded the highest number of deaths among Washington hospitals. See Martin G.
      Murray, "."<a href="#r1">[back]
