      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Tis a long time since I have written to you<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—not since I wrote a short note from Pittsburgh &nbsp;I received a few days ago a paper
      (Boston) containing a notice of you<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I was much pleased upon reading it—
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all pretty well all <em>very</em> well except Mat &nbsp;she has a bad cough<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—and she has had it so long that I begin to feel quite anxious that she should be
      rid of it &nbsp;I have had a doctor examine her lungs two or three times but he says they
      are not as yet to any extent affected &nbsp;I miss the advice and counsel of Dr. Ruggles<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> in all such cases much—Mat caught a bad cold when we first moved to the house<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> we are living in and she has not been entirely free from it since although she has
      been better once or twice—I am in great hopes however that in a few weeks she will
      get the better of it. How are matters progressing with you—I suppose as usual—is the
      hot weather in Washington pretty bad &nbsp;We have had a visit from Grant<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> but he is coming and going like any other "man" and I guess it is a good thing people
      dont get excited [during] this hot weather
   </p>
   
   
   <p>What do you think of the selection of candidates by the New York Convention<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—rather a lame affair isnt it—but of all the poor devils old Chase<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> must feel the worse &nbsp;I can not conceive of a more general "cave in" than Mr Chase[e]
      made—and our friend A. J.<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> cannot be over jovial at the result.
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you ever see anything of Mason<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup>—if so how does he look and what will he do when Grant is elected Prest.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are progressing slowly with the work<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup>—not so fast as I hoped or expected—Yet I guess 'twill come out all right &nbsp;We have
      most of the work under contract—one will be let tomorrow and but one or two more after
      that &nbsp;I am kept pretty busy &nbsp;the little questions of all kinds coming up require nearly
      all my time—we have a pretty large Engnring force—larger than they usually employ on work in the west—still none to many to keep
      every thing straight
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt cant you get some tickets on the next great Pacific Rail Road spree<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n12" id="r12">12</a></sup> and come out and see us and if you or I can get the tickets Mat and I will join you
      and go to the end of the road—would[n't] it be a jolly good time—I suppose they will
      have a trip or two of that kind this fall
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I went a few weeks ago on a little sail up and down the river with a party that were
      "doing" the "Editors Assotn"<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n13" id="r13">13</a></sup> &nbsp;I was much amused by the style of a large number of them—particularly of the young
      style—like young Noah<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n14" id="r14">14</a></sup> used to be—fellows that thought that they had to <em>look</em> the newspaper as well as report for one &nbsp;The speeches were sickening—and the "eat"
      jolly—the sail splendid &nbsp;I wish you could have been along—not so much that you might
      have seen the "eds" but that you might have enjoyed the sail—yet it was'nt the sail to Cony Island by a long ways.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>What will be the result so far as you are concerned should Mr Evarts<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n15" id="r15">15</a></sup> be made Atty Gen—will it make your place any less secure? Are your friends in Washington
      all right as regards their "sits" O'Conner<sup><a href="#loc.00447_n16" id="r16">16</a></sup> and the rest—I suppose the political boiling is really more heard than felt in regard
      to office holding—I know lost [<em>sic</em>] of fellows in Brook[lyn] (and it is the same with Engineers) that always think they
      are going to be deprived of office and "<em>clout</em>."
   </p>
   
   <p>Well Walt I have to stop and go home to dinner—you would be very welcome to go if
      you only could I can tell you—Mat and the Children would almost love you to-death
      &nbsp;The children are growing nicely—Hattie has got so she can read a letter—Jess is still
      the baby and therefore dont learn or anything else but play—they both grow though quite fast—and will I think
      go through the hot season without much trouble—
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish you would write me when you can—a letter way off here is quite an event and
      highly prized
   </p>
   
   <p>Give our love to Mother when you write and the same to yourself</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00447_n1">1. Jeff was so busy at
      this time that it would be wrong to suggest he was neglecting Walt Whitman.
      After receiving a letter from Jeff, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman remarked to Walt
      Whitman on March 11, 1868: "i thought when i read it he must have written it
      running for i could hardly make it out &nbsp;he is very busy" (Trent Collection of
      Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections
      Library).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00447_n2">2. The only such notice in
      a Boston paper for this month was Ferdinand Freiligrath's "Walt Whitman" in the
      <em>Boston Commonwealth</em>, July 4, 1868. Freiligrath
      claimed that "For his admirers, Whitman is the only American poet, derived from
      the soil, expressing his age....He makes ordinary verse-making seem childish."
      Surprisingly, Jeff noted Freiligrath's admiration of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> before Walt Whitman himself, who first mentions it on September
      27, 1868 (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961-77],2:48).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00447_n3">3. Jeff first noted
      Mattie's chronic sore throat on February 10, 1863 (see ), but it
      was only in 1868 that he began to express deep fears about her condition. For an
      account of the progress of Mattie's disease, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York:
      New York University Press, 1977), pp. 2-4.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00447_n4">4. Edward Ruggles (see
      ) had died the previous year.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00447_n5">5. On March 1 the
      Jefferson Whitmans began renting a seven-room house on Olive Street for
      sixty-five dollars a month (Waldron, p. 50, and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to
      Walt Whitman, February 12, 1868 [Trent]).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00447_n6">6. Now the Republican
      nominee for president, Grant arrived in St. Louis on July 7 to visit his wife's
      parents, the Dents, who lived on a farm outside town. He deliberately avoided
      public appearances, shrewdly preferring to play the role of the simple soldier
      while the Democrats politicked in New York.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00447_n7">7. After numerous ballots,
      the Democrats surprised the nation by nominating Horatio Seymour for president
      and Francis P. Blair, Jr., for vice-president.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00447_n8">8. Chief Justice Salmon P.
      Chase (1808-73) had aspired to be president for many years, and in 1868, though
      known as a prominent Republican he made a bid to become the nominee of the
      Democratic party but failed.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00447_n9">9. Andrew Johnson received
      sixty-five votes on the first ballot; however, after Seymour was nominated,
      Johnson supported the ticket.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00447_n10">10. See .<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00447_n11">11. By this time Jeff had
      completed the settling reservoirs at Bissell's point but still had to construct
      the pump houses and water intake towers.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00447_n12">12. As part of their
      promotional schemes to encourage western settlement, railroads such as the
      Missouri Pacific offered free passes to writers and journalists who agreed to
      take one of the special excursions over the newest routes.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00447_n13">13. On June 25, 1868, the
      mayor and city council of St. Louis entertained a group of newspaper editors
      from Wisconsin and Minnesota by giving them a one-day champagne cruise on the
      Mississippi steamboat <em>Belle of Alton</em>. Jeff mingled with
      local politicians, judges, and journalists, including Carl Schurz of the <em>St. Louis Democrat</em>, and he listened to numerous speeches
      proclaiming the virtues of the city and its illustrious guests (<em>Missouri Republican</em>, June 26, 1868).<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00447_n14">14. Probably the son of
      Mordecai M. ("Major") Noah (1785-1851), a prominent New York editor. Walt
      Whitman wrote two articles about New Orleans which appeared in the April 2 and
      May 21, 1848, issues of Noah's <em>Sunday Times</em> (Joseph Jay
      Rubin, <em>The Historic Whitman</em> [University Park:
      Pennsylvania State University Press, 1973], p. 373).<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00447_n15">15. William M. Evarts
      (1818-1901), Andrew Johnson's brilliant defense attorney in the impeachment
      proceedings, was rewarded with the appointment to attorney general in
      1868.<a href="#r15">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00447_n16">16. See .<a href="#r16">[back]
