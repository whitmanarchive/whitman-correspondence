   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00172_n8">1. This letter dates to between
      September 15 and September 26, 1871. The letter dates to mid- or late-September
      1871 based on the approaching visit of Mary Isadore "Minnie" Van Nostrand and
      family. Minnie was the younger daughter of Mary Elizabeth Van Nostrand, Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's elder daughter. Louisa was anxious about the Van Nostrands'
      visit because her daughter Mary proposed that she, her husband Ansel, and two
      daughters would spend approximately a week in Brooklyn to shop in preparation
      for Minnie's upcoming marriage on October 17. Louisa acquiesced to the proposal,
      and the visit began on September 27 (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman). A late-September date for
      this letter is corroborated by Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's visit to
      Brooklyn in fall 1871. Though two of Walt Whitman's letters to his mother and a
      letter from Martha Mitchell "Mattie" to Jeff are mentioned, which if available
      could narrow the range of dates, not one of the letters is extant. Randall H.
      Waldron dated the letter "about September 17, 1871" (<em>Mattie:
         The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1971], 72, n. 1), but it could date up to a week later and still
      anticipate the Van Nostrands' visit.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n3">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">3. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">5. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n6">6. Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,

   <p id="tex.00172_n18">7. Only the first two letters
      of the word "has" are visible in the image. The letter is pasted into a
      manuscript book, and the final letters on the edge closest to the binding in the
      page image are often obscured. Most of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman manuscript
      letters in the bound volume entitled <em>Walt Whitman: A Series of
         Thirteen Letters from His Mother to Her Son</em>, held at the Harry Ransom
      Center, have obscured text on at least one page. Text from this page was
      recorded based on an examination of the physical volume, which allowed more text
      to be recovered.<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="tex.00172_n9">8. Mary Isadore "Minnie" Van
      Nostrand (1851–1938) married Leander Jay Young (1846–1937) on
      October 18, 1871 (Gertrude A. Barber, compiler, "Marriages of Suffolk County,
      N.Y. Taken from the 'Republican Watchman': A Newspaper Published at Greenport,
      N.Y. Years 1871, 1872, 1873, 1874, 1875, 1876," [1950], 1:3,

      expected departure, see her  and

   <p id="tex.00172_n6">9. George Washington Whitman
      married Louisa Orr Haslam (1842–1892), called "Loo" or "Lou," in spring
      1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden. At the
      insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live with George and Lou in the
      Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt Whitman responsible for Edward's
      board.<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="tex.00172_n7">10. Charles Hine
      (1827–1871), an artist, had died on July 31, 1871, only days after a
      visit by Walt Whitman. Julia Hine indicated her plan to visit Walt's mother
      in Brooklyn in an  letter to
      Walt. After Julia Hine's earlier visit, Louisa wished she had been able to
      give her money (see Louisa's 
      letter to Walt).<br><br>
      Charles Hine's painting of the poet was the model for the engraving that
      became the frontispiece for <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1860
      (see Walt Whitman's July 14, 1871 letter to Charles Hine, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Ted Genoways [Iowa City: University of
      Iowa Press, 2004], 7:31; and see <em>Connecticut, Deaths and
         Burials Index, 1650–1934</em> [Salt Lake City: FamilySearch,
