      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Old Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was indeed delighted to receive your kind p.c. of the 8th<sup><a href="#loc.02463_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> inst which, together with that<sup><a href="#loc.02463_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> to J.W.W.<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; the cablegram from H.L.T.<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup> greatly relieved our anxiety regarding you. I am very glad to learn that at the time
      of writing you seemed to be getting over your bad time—"a bad two months" &amp; I fondly
      hope that by this time the attack has passed off &amp; left you in comparative comfort
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Sorry to hear of Dr B's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r5">5</a></sup> illness. Hope that he has now quite recovered from it
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Things are going on</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>with us here much as usual—my time being chiefly occupied with my profession at work,
      with, as you will see from the <u>Bolton Journal</u> which I send you, an occasional social diversion.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>During the last three weeks my wife<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r6">6</a></sup> has been on the sick list—suffering from a rather severe attack of spasmodic bronchial
      catarrh &amp; neuralgea, which I am glad to say seem to be slowly subsiding now.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I presume you have recd the Feb No. of the <u>Review of Reviews</u> containing a facsimile of one of your p.c's &amp; a portrait. I am sorry the latter is
      such an unsatisfactory one <u>&amp; I don't like that "foxy" portrait</u> to go before the English people as <u>your</u> counterfeit presentiment, but
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>it seems to be the only one that the London folks have of you. I thought of sending
      the editor of the <u>Rev of Rev</u> (Mr Stead)<sup><a href="#n4113" id="r7">7</a></sup> a copy of the one you sent to J.W.W. but he &amp; I think it best not to do so until
      after the publication of yr "2nd Annex" of which it will be one of the attractions.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have secured the copyright of that portrait in this country so that it cannot be
      reproduced without my permission.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Should you <u>wish</u> me to send a copy (?Notes as well) I will do so but not without your express desire
      or should you send him one perhaps you would kindly mention the fact of its [illegible]
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>being copyrighted by me.</p>
   
   
   <p>At the next exhibition of my American photographic slides—which will be on Mar 5th
      on the occasion of the opening of the Photographic Society's new rooms—I intend throwing
      a fac simile of one of your p.c's by the lime light on to a [
      <span class="unclear">aft?</span>]
       screen. I enclose a copy of it for your inspection.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>During the last few days we have had mild but rather murky weather—some fog wh: King
      Sol has struggled to pierce—with a touch of frost at nights covering everything with
      its beautiful white rim, &amp; the afternon the birds were carolling gaily.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pardon this hastily written letter as I am rather busy &amp; am initiating my new assistant
      into his duties
   </p>
   
   
   <p>With best love to you &amp; with kindest regards to all your household I remain</p>

   <p>Feb 28/91</p>
   
   
   <p>Since writing the foregoing I have received the March no. of <u>Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</u> direct from the London publishers<sup><a href="#loc.03120_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup>—a favourfor which I am indebted to the kindness of yourself &amp; H.L.T. &amp; for which I now desire
      to return my best &amp; warmest thanks to you both.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Never, in my opinion did the house of Lippincott do itself greater honour than when it issued this "Whitman number" which, with its new poems, new memoranda,
      now portrait, &amp; new H.L.T. article &amp; postscript by "the old man himself," is a veritable
      storehouse of precious "Whitmaniana"—a <u>bonne bouche</u> which I
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>have devoured with eager delight not resting until I had swallowed the last morsel.</p>
   
   
   <p>Oh how good it tasted as I ruminated, absorbed &amp; assimilated it on my professional
      round this morning!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>With what graphic &amp; realistic fidelity have you pictured that "rather large 20-by-20
      low ceiling'd room, something like a big old ship's cabin" with its literary chaos—really
      kosmos to you—its stove its "bed with snow white coverlid"—possibly the counterpane
      that <u>we</u> sent you—its rattan seated &amp; backed armchair &amp; its "hundred indescribable things
      besides". As I read your words I seem to be sitting there beside you listening to
      your sweet voice, looking
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>into your eyes &amp; feeling the warm grasp of your hand in mine, &amp; my heart fills &amp; dilates
      with conscious laudable pride at the thought that I too am one of your friends—not
      by correspondence merely but by personal acquaintance—to whom the "breath of your
      heart goes over the sea-gales across the big pond".
   </p>
   
   
   <p>thanks &amp; again thanks to you &amp; H.L.T. whose splendid article I purpose reading to the College probably at its next meeting</p>
   
   
   <p>As you will see by the heading of this sheet I am writing this at Anderton in JWW's
      house. He is sitting near me writing the postscripts of his letter to you &amp; H.L.T.<sup><a href="#loc.02463_n3" id="r9">9</a></sup></p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Your portrait looks down upon us from its frame over the mantelpiece &amp; I am using
      <u>L of G</u> as a writing desk! Out of doors the silence only broken by the voices of a few children
      down the road &amp; the song of a thrush; the sun is obscured &amp; a beautiful soft grey
      haze hangs over the distant fields &amp; trees.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>With best love</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,

   <p id="n6121">3. James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire

   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n4113">7. William Thomas Stead
      (1849–1912) was a well-known English journalist and editor of <em>The Pall Mall Gazette</em> in the 1880s. He was a proponent of
      what he called "government by journalism" and advocated for a strong press that
      would influence public opinion and affect government decision-making. His
      investigative reports were much discussed and often had significant social
      impact. He has sometimes been credited with inventing what came to be called
      "tabloid journalism," since he worked to make newspapers more attractive to
      readers, incorporating maps, illustrations, interviews, and eye-catching
      headlines. He died on the <em>Titanic</em> when it sank in
      1912.<a href="#r7">[back]
