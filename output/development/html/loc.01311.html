   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The Contemporary Club was a
      Philadelphia literary circle established in 1886 by the essayist Agnes Repplier.
      In 1887, Whitman gave a reading of "The Mystic Trumpeter" and "A Voice from the
      Sea" at the club.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01311_n1">1. This letter is composed
      of a thinner material than Whitman normally writes on during this period. Thus,
      the ink on the recto seeps through to the verso side.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4146">2. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel (1856–1914), was
      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on his relationship with Whitman, see

         Whitman's Friend and Literary Executor</em>, ed. Peter Van Egmond (Hartford:
