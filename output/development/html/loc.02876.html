      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Two papers have come to hand since I last wrote; one containing the memoranda made
      during the war—precious records, eagerly read &amp;
      treasured &amp; reread by me. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How the busy days slip by, one so like another, yet each with its own fresh &amp;
      pleasant flavor &amp; scent, as like and as different as the leaves on a tree, or
      the plants in the hedgerows.
   </p>
   
   <p>Days they are busy with humble enough occupations, but lit up for me not only with
      the light of hope, but with the half–hidden joy of one who knows she has found
      what she sought and laid [
      <span class="unclear">such strong hold</span>]
       upon it that she fears nothing, questions
      nothing,—no life, or death, nor, in the end, in her own imperfections, flaws,
      shortcomings. For to be 
       so
      conscious of these, and to love and understand you so, are proofs [
      <span class="unclear">that</span>]
      
      
      the germs [
      <span class="unclear">of all are in
         her, &amp;</span>]
       perhaps in the warmth &amp; [
      <span class="unclear">joyous</span>]
       sunshine of your presence would
      grow fast. Anyhow, distance has not [
      <span class="unclear">baffled her, and time will not.</span>]
       A great
      deal of needlework to be done at this time of year; for my girls have not time for
      any at present; it is not a good contrast [
      <span class="unclear">or the right thing after longish</span>]
       hours
      of study—much better household [
      <span class="unclear">activity of</span>]
       any sort. If they would but
      understand this in schools &amp; colleges for girls &amp; young women! No healthier
      or more cheerful occupation as a relief from study, could be found than household
      work—sweeping, scrubbing, washing, ironing, cooking—in the variety of
      it, &amp; equable development of the muscles, I should think equal to the most
      elaborate gymnastics. 
      I know very well how I have felt, &amp; still feel the want of having been put to
      these things when a girl. Then the importance afterwards of doing them easily &amp;
      well &amp; without undue fatigue, to all who aim to give practical shape to their
      ardent belief in equality &amp; fair play for all! In domestic life under one roof,
      at all events it is already feasible to make the disposals without ignominious
      distinctions,—not all the rough bodily work never ending, still begining; and
      the mental culture and abundant leisure all to the other—but a wholesome
      interchange and sharing of these. Not least too among the advantages of taking an
      active share in these 
      duties is the zest, the keen relish it gives to the hours not too easily secured for
      reading &amp; music. Besides, I often think that just as the Poem Nature is made up
      half of rude, rough realities &amp; homely materials &amp; processes, so it is
      necessary for women to construct their [
      <span class="unclear">Poem, Home,</span>]
       on a groundwork of
      homeliest details &amp; occupations providing for the bodily wants &amp; comforts of
      their household, and that without putting their own hands to this, their Poem will
      lack the vital fresh growing nature-like quality that alone endures, and that of
      this soil will grow, with fitting  preparation &amp; culture a noble &amp; more vigorous
      intellectual life in women, fit to embody itself in wider spheres
      afterwards—if the call comes. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This month of May that comes to you so laden with great and sorrowful &amp; beautiful
      &amp; tender memories, and that is your birth month too, I cannot say that I think
      of you more than at any other time, for there is no month nor day that my thoughts
      do not habitually &amp; spontaneously turn to you, refer all to you; yet I seem to
      come closer, because of the Poems that tell me of what relates to that time; but
      most of all when I think of your beloved Mother, because then I
      often yearn, more than I 
      [
      <span class="unclear">know how to
         bear,</span>]
       to comfort you with love and tender care and silent
      companionship. [
      <span class="unclear">May is in
         a</span>]
       sense [
      <span class="unclear">(&amp; a very real one) my birth</span>]
       month too, for in it were [
      <span class="unclear">your Poems</span>]
       first put
      into [
      <span class="unclear">my hand.</span>]
      
      I wish so I were quite [
      <span class="unclear">sure that</span>]
       you no longer [
      <span class="unclear">suffer in your head,</span>]
       and that you can
      move about without effort or difficulty—perhaps before long there will be a
      paper with some paragraph about your health, for though [
      <span class="unclear">we say to ourselves</span>]
       no news is good
      news, it is a very different thing to [
      <span class="unclear">have the</span>]
       absolute [
      <span class="unclear">affirmation of good</span>]
      
      news. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My children are all well and hearty I am thankful to say, &amp; working
      industriously. Grace means to study the best system of Kinder
      garten teaching—I fancy she is well suited for Kinder garten teaching &amp;
      that it is very excellent work— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Herby is still drawing from the antique in the
      British Museum. I hope he will get into the Academy this summer. He is going
      [
      <span class="unclear">to spend
         his</span>]
       holidays with his brother in
      South Wales—and we as usual at Colne, but that will not be till August. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Did I tell you William Rossetti and his bride were spending
      their honeymoon at Naples? [
      <span class="unclear">&amp; have found it bitterly</span>]
      
       cold there I
      hear—Mr.
      &amp; Mrs. Conway &amp; their
      children are well. Eustace is coming to spend the afternoon with Herby
      to–morrow.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
