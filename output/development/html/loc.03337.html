   <p>This letter was to have been written five days ago; but, like many other things that
      I project, it had to be put off a while. Lately there have been many small events
      to
      break through the usual run of things, &amp;, as you know, I have not a genius for
      despatch at any time. So letters &amp; other writings have gone to the wall.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Last week my brother, Percy, who is an actor, came up to town with the news that he
      was going off to South Africa on a six-months'<sup><a href="#loc.03337_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>tour. He sails to-morrow afternoon by the "Norham Castle" from Blackwall, &amp;
      to-day my Mother &amp; Father, anxious to see the last of their boy, have arrived to
      bid him farewell. With them came also two old friends of mine,,—Will Dircks, who
      is now Walter Scotts' right-hand man in the literary part of the publishing, and
      Joseph Skipsey, poet of north-country mining life, typical in rugged personal
      strength &amp; general appearance of the Northumbrian coal-fields. It was a striking
      sight to see the crowds of holiday-makers who poured out of the excursion &amp;
      other trains, when my brother &amp; I
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>went to meet these travellers early this morning. Easter Monday is a great day with
      both the Londoners, who go off into the country, and the country-folk, who come to
      London to spend a holiday. Fortunately too, the sun is shining in a way to remind
      me
      of New York &amp; Washington, &amp; the Spring is making great progress in park
      &amp; garden. If this sunshine lasts, the trees will soon be in full leaf, &amp;
      then—Hey, for the life of the fields. Already—feeling somewhat pent up
      here in town—I think of a jaunt to North Wales, there to climb mountains and
      make friends with sun &amp; wind &amp; rain!
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Before that, however, there is Paris &amp; the Exhibition to tempt one over the
      Channel. It is absurd that I have never yet found my way to France. One feels that
      over there one should have plenty of money to spend, and failing this I have waited
      &amp; waited. But now there is little excuse for waiting longer, as excursions are
      being run at such low rates. So possibly the next letter you have from me will be
      dated Paris. In America I became infected somewhat with the itch for travel, &amp;
      suppose I shall not rest now till I have wandered all over the globe.
   </p>
   
   
   <p><u>24th April</u></p>
   
   
   <p>I take up the thread of this rough and</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p><u>2</u></p>
   
   
   <p>ready scribble again, after two days' interval. Yesterday I went down to Blackwall
      to
      see my brother stowed safely on board the "Norham Castle". She is a fine, large
      boat, comfortably fitted, &amp; well officered; &amp; there was an interesting lot
      of passengers—including the actors &amp; actresses of the [
      <span class="unclear">Coy?</span>]
      . which my brother has
      joined. I felt quite inclined to go off too. There is a great rush to South Africa
      at present—owing to the contagion of the gold &amp; diamond mining fever.
      Several fine young fellows of my acquaintance—engineers &amp;c. have gone out
      to Kimberley within the past year.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This morning I have been visiting various studios with Joseph Skipsey. This afternoon
      he has gone to see Oscar Wilde. It is good fun going about
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>town with an outsider, a north-countryman like Skipsey, for he sees everything with
      such original eyes,—going into raptures over the flowers in Covent Garden
      Market, or the gleaming fish on the fish stalls. It is surely a great thing to have
      that fresh &amp; poetic sense of these everyday details—that the over-cultured
      London man takes no interest in.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In the same way, it was pleasant to hear Alys Smith<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> a few days back, when she had
      just returned from Italy &amp; the Riviera, talking about London with as much
      enthusiasm as ever. She called the other afternoon, greatly to my sister Edith's
      delight, &amp; gave us a characteristic account of her adventures. Logan<sup><a href="#n6122" id="r3">3</a></sup> often comes
      in too. The other day
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>he &amp; his father drove round here, &amp; in my absence carried off Edith, who had
      never seen them before, for a long drive in the park. I have not seen Mrs. Costelloe<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      of late. She has been rather unwell, ever since the baby's birth, &amp; now she
      &amp; her husband are staying down in Surrey.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hear by the House of Parliament clock that is nearly post-time, so I must bring
      my
      gossip to an end. Next letter I must try &amp; send you a more solid kind of
      writing,—but one cannot always be solid.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Logan Smith said that his sister had had a card from you lately. I hope that this
      means you are getting stronger &amp; easier with the incoming of the Spring.
      Remembrances to Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r5">5</a></sup>, Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; all other friends

   <p><u>24th</u> General Boulanger arrived in London this
      afternoon,—another note in the Cosmopolitan symphony. London will get some
      fun out of him—if nothing else. He seems somewhat doubtfully heroic.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <p id="loc.03337_n1">1. Rhys added a note dated
      the 24th in the left margin of this page. Because the letter is dated the 22nd,

   <p id="loc.05908_n1">2. Alys Smith
      (1867–1951) was a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith and eventually married

   <p id="n6122">3. Logan Pearsall Smith
      (1865–1946) was an essayist and literary critic. He was the son of Robert
      Pearsall Smith, a minister and writer who befriended Whitman, and he was the
      brother of Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, one of Whitman's most avid followers.

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02189_n1">4. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="n0259">6. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
