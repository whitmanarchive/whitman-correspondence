      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your card to New Haven followed me on here, where I have been for some months,
      looking after the production of a work on wood-engraving.
   </p>
   
   <p>The enclosed letter seems to have anticipated your request. My answer to it has
      crossed the letter enclosing yours. In sending that I wrote also home, telling them
      to
      look for and forward the block<sup><a href="#loc.03271_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> to Stedman.<sup><a href="#n4177" id="r3">3</a></sup> I presume it before
      now has gone to him. Will you write to him for what use you yourself need of it.  I am glad to see
      your hand again &amp; anyway to hear of you I hope you keep in fair health &amp; in
      as much prosperity as may be necessary for the poet.
   </p>
   
   <p>For myself, after some five years work on a book concerning my own especial art, I
      am
      now waiting the return, which may give me a sufficiency, or may not. At 76, or close
      upon it, one need not be very anxious. I keep in good health.
   </p>
   
   <p>Give me a few words of yourself. The above address will find me for some months to
      come.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Always heartily yours
      <br></br>WJ Linton

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William J. Linton
      (1812–1897), a British-born wood engraver, came to the United States in
      1866 and settled near New Haven, Connecticut. He illustrated the works of John
      Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, and
      others, wrote the "indispensable" <em>History of Wood-Engraving in
         America</em> (1882), and edited <em>Poetry of America,
         1776–1876</em> (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Whitman's
      poems as well as a frontispiece engraving of the poet. According to his <em>Threescore and Ten Years, 1820 to
         1890—Recollections</em> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Whitman
      in Washington and later visited him in Camden (which Whitman reported in his
      , letter to Peter Doyle): "I
      liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, . . . a true poet
      who could not write poetry, much of 
      wilfulness
      
       accounting for his neglect of form."
