      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I write to you, though personally unknown, as writing to a dear friend: because,
      though happy to call many about me by the name of friends, I have no truer friend
      than yourself: if friendship means the receiving of light and delight and strength
      from the spirit of a brother man. I have lived as yet but eighteen years: yet in all
      the constant thoughts and acts of my last few years, your words have been my guides
      and true oracles. I cannot hope to see you face to face, and tell  you this: but
      you will at least believe it and feel that I am not writing from an unworthy spirit
      of self-assertion: but that I should feel shame for myself, were I not to show the
      reality of my gratitude to you, even through the weakness of words—you, whom I
      thankfully acknowledge for my veritable master and dear brother. 
   </p>
   
   <p> You, in your age and glorious approach to the sure future of death—you will
      know that I am speaking neither empty adulation nor shallow shams. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I am proud of belonging to the oldest school of any in England—to the great
      foundation of the strong priest and ruler, William of Wykeham: and it was under the
      shadows of the ancient walls of his college, still flourishing through the influence
      of his powerful personality, that I first received "Leaves of Grass" from the hands
      of a most dear friend. And the help and exaltation that I won from it have been won
      by many another boy and young man, of those in whose hands rests the immediate
      history of the coming  years—to make it splendid with strong actions and strong
      asserted truths. It is in your works, as in the great powers of earth and sea, that
      the inspiring force of no school is to be found: certain to dare all things by the
      strength of body and soul inseparable. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Whether I am right or not in writing to you, I neither know nor care: I do know that
      I cannot keep silence.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Lionel Johnson (1867–1902)
      was an English poet and critic. With William Butler Yeats, Ernest Dowson, and
      close Whitman associates Thomas W. H. Rolleston and Ernest Rhys, he was a member
      of the Rhymers' Club, a well-known group of writers who met in London in the
      1890s, and whose members also included Lord Alfred Douglas and, briefly,
      Douglas's friend and lover Oscar Wilde, who were introduced to each other by
      Johnson. Discussing Johnson's letter with Horace Traubel, Whitman exclaimed: "it
      was a very remarkable letter . . . Keep a weather eye open for that boy: he will
      appear again" (<em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.39.html">Wednesday, August 22, 1888</a>).
