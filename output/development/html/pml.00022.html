      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Will some of you, the first time you go down town, stop at office (or shop) 
      of E. Godkin,<sup><a href="#pml.00022_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> 130 Nassau st. &amp; see if you can get me two or three copies 
      of a new paper, the <em>London Chronicle</em>,<sup><a href="#pml.00022_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> with a piece about <em>Leaves of Grass</em> 
      &amp;c. I think it must be the paper for June 22—(though it may be June 29—or June 15)—but
      you must look &amp; see—Godkin is the American agent.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am well as usual—work in the same office—all goes on the same in the office 
      &amp; generally. Mother has moved to 1194 Atlantic street—(not av.)—opposite Hamilton
      st. You take Fulton av. cars. Ellen O'Connor is 
      going for the summer to coast of Rhode Island—her little girl Jenny 
      is afflicted with bad swellings &amp;c of joints—appears to be scrofulous—William O'Connor
      is well—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How are you all? Write me a good long letter—tell me all the news—all about the girls,
      &amp; Mr. Arnold—&amp; the last from Arthur, &amp; every thing—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So good bye for this time—I send you my love, dear friend, &amp; same to the dear girls—&amp;
      to all.
      
   </p>

   <p>If you can get the papers, direct them to me &nbsp;&nbsp;Attorney Gen's Office—</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pml.00022_n1">1. This letter's envelope
      bears the address, "Mrs. Abby H. Price, | 279 East 55th street, | New York
      City." It is postmarked: "Washington | Jul | (?) | D.C."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00022_n3">2. Edwin L. Godkin
      (1831–1902) was the founder of the <em>Nation</em>, and a
      publisher, with a shop at the address Walt Whitman cited.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00022_n4">3. William Michael
      Rossetti's article on Walt Whitman appeared on July 6, 1867. As Burroughs
      observed to a friend, it "had a profound effect" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [New York: Houghton
      Mifflin, 1931], 48). On April 30, 1867, William Michael Rossetti had called on
      Conway and had borrowed the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, as well
      as the proofs of Burroughs' <em>Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and
         Person</em>; see the <em>Rossetti Papers</em> (London: Sands
      &amp; Co., 1903), 181, and Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary
         Singer</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1955), 383. He probably had also seen the
      material which O'Connor had sent Conway on December 5, 1866 (Yale)—a copy
      of Burroughs' article in the <em>Galaxy</em>, and his own article
      in the <em>New York Times</em> on December 2, 1866.<a href="#r3">[back]
