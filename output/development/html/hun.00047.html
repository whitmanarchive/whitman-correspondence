   <p>I write in answer to the note on the other side from my dear friend O'Reilly<sup><a href="#hun.00047_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—My plan is to have all my poems, down to date,
      comprised in one 12 mo: Volume, under the name "Leaves of Grass"—I think it
      will have to be in brevier (or bourgeois) solid—and I want as fine a (plain)
      specimen in type, paper, ink, binding, &amp;c. as bookmaking can produce,—not
      for luxury however, but solid wear, use, reading, (to carry in the pocket, valise
      &amp;c)—a book of about 400 pages to sell at $3—The text will be about
      the same as hitherto, occasional slight revisions, simplifications in punctuation
      &amp;c—the main thing a more satisfactory consecutive order—a better <u>ensemble</u>, to suit me—some new pieces, perhaps 30
      pages—
   </p>
   
   <p>Fair warning on one point—the old pieces, the <u>sexuality</u> ones, about which the original row was started &amp; kept up so
      long, are all retained, &amp; must go in the same as ever<sup><a href="#hun.00047_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Should you, upon this outline, wish to see the copy, I will place it in
      your hands with pleasure—

   <p> Hope you got safe home. James R. Osgood want to see the material for your

      about it?

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="hun.00047_n1">1. James R. Osgood
      (1836–1892) was the publisher of Browning, Arnold, Holmes, Henry James,
      and Howells; see Carl J. Weber, <em>The Rise and Fall of James
         Ripley Osgood</em> (1959).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hun.00047_n2">2. John Boyle O'Reilly
      (1844–1890) was a fervent Irish patriot who joined the British Army in
      order to sabotage it. He was arrested and sentenced to be hanged in 1866. Later
      the decree was altered, and O'Reilly was sent to Australia, where he escaped on
      an American whaler in 1869. In 1876 he became the coeditor of the Boston <em>Pilot</em>, a position which he held until his death in 1890.
      See William G. Schofield, <em>Seek for a Hero: The Story of John
         Boyle O'Reilly</em> (New York: Kennedy, 1956). On  O'Reilly informed Whitman that "James R Osgood wants to see
      the material for your complete book." Whitman's letter to Osgood was written, as
      he indicated, on the verso of O'Reilly's.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hun.00047_n3">3. Osgood did not pay
      sufficient attention to Whitman's "warning," since he was not prepared to resist
      the censors who succeeded in protecting Boston's dubious morality by making it a
      national joke.<a href="#r3">[back]
