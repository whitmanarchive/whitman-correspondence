      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mrs. Johnston,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This is the queer little book, perhaps you may remember I spoke about some weeks
      since. It is odd in form, &amp; may be without attractiveness at first—but
      somehow I think it real <em>good</em> &amp; <em>deep</em>—(after you
      break the crust &amp; get a little used to it.) My Dear friend I am so sorry to hear
      by Johnny that you are ill, &amp; suffering—I wish I could send you something,
      or do something for your relief—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00085_n1">1. There is too little
      information to identify a specific date or what the "queer little book" might
      be. The letter was apparently written after one of Whitman's visits to the
      Johnstons in New York.<a href="#r1">[back]
