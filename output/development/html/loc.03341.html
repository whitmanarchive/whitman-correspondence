      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was glad to have the Birthday<sup><a href="#loc.03027_n4" id="r1">1</a></sup> book<sup><a href="#loc.03027_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> the other day, with its record of so many
      friendly voices. Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r3">3</a></sup> was very good to let mine be heard so
      prominently in the throng. I believe I even blushed a little to find my lines so
      bravely in evidence.
   </p>
   
   <p>As I write, the snow is falling, &amp; the sky is leaden overhead. A regular English
      winter's day! I wonder if it is the same at Camden whose streets and ferries I
      remember best under wintry aspects. At present I am quartered at
      Hampstead,—not far away from Gilchrist's<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r4">4</a></sup> house in Well
      Road, tell him!
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>Hampstead is by far the highest part of London, &amp; this cottage is very near the top
      of the Heath, approaching 500 feet above the sea. I find it much healthier than the
      low-lying parts near the river. After the Welsh mountain winds, the regular London
      air is rather trying,—no oxygen, no stimulus, in it!
   </p>
   
   <p>There is much at Hampstead that you would like. The high road that runs along the
      top
      of the Heath, (called the Spaniards Road, &amp; passing an old inn where Skittles are
      still played, called "The Spaniards"), has a fine view down to London on the south
      &amp;
      the open country on the north. It is a fine walk either on a bright morning, or at
      night when the glamour in the sky &amp; the glitter of Camps below &amp; the hum of the city
      tell that the
      monster, London, lies there, hydra-like, with pains untold &amp; pleasures extreme in
      his various heads.
   </p> 
   
   <p>Edith<sup><a href="#loc.03341_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; I went to call on Miss Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r6">6</a></sup> on Sunday last, &amp; found
      her very well. She said that her brother would probably be home in February. Some
      of
      his friends were beginning to think he meant to settle oversea for good. I suppose
      he is waiting to astonish us with a <u>magnum opus</u>.
   </p>
   
   <p>We have a young American novelist over here at present with his wife,—Henry
      Harland<sup><a href="#loc.03341_n1" id="r7">7</a></sup> ("Sidney Luska.") They are very bright &amp; interesting, more rapid &amp; restless
      than we slow Englischers. He however in his turn seems to be astonished at the
      immense amount of hard writing that English men of letters get through. "It is your sedative
      climate which makes the difference," he says in discussing it. There's no doubt that
      the English climate does tend to concentrate one's energies.
   </p>
   
   <p>For my own part, I feel now that concentration is the one thing that I lack. Too many
      distractions in this hydra-headed London. It would be good to retire for seven years
      to some mountain solitude, &amp; there, hermit-like, work out the purposes of one's
      destiny,—as Carlyle did. Meanwhile this probation in a world's city is helpful
      &amp; good, fortunately, in other ways.
   </p>
   
   <p>I suppose you had copies of the 'Illustrated London News' with your portrait. It
      figured well in the shop-windows here.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03027_n4">1. For Whitman's seventieth
      birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
      the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
      (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.30.html">Tuesday, May 7, 1889</a>. The day was celebrated with a testimonial
      dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
      addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
      arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03027_n3">2. The notes and addresses that
      were delivered at Whitman's seventieth birthday celebration on May 31, 1889 in
      Camden, were collected and edited by Horace Traubel. The volume was titled <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em>, and it included a
      photo of Sidney Morse's 1887 clay bust of Whitman as the frontispiece. The book
      was published in 1889 by Philadelphia publisher David McKay.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">4. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03341_n2">5. Rhys may be referring to his sister, Edith. Edwin Haviland Miller speculates that
      the "Edith" Whitman refers to
      in his , letter to Rhys is Rhys's sister.

   <p id="n0890">6. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="loc.03341_n1">7. Henry Harland was an
      American author who wrote under the pseudonym Sidney Luska (Josh Lambert, "<em>As It Was Written: A Jewish Musician's Story [1885]</em> by
      Sidney Luska, <em>American Jewish Fiction</em>, [Philadelphia: The
