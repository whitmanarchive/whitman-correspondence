      <br></br><br></br>Dear Hank
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am staying here yet—yesterday Deb<sup><a href="#nyp.00417_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> came over here about 2 o'clock &amp; we took Modoc &amp; went over (your Mother &amp; I) to the
      old place<sup><a href="#nyp.00417_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—went down to the pond &amp; all around—I thought the pond, &amp; creek, the big part there
      to the west, looked beautiful as ever—the big spring, the other way (east) is all
      stopped up, disappeared altogether—the big south field Wes has got in wheat—otherways
      things look not much different—pretty lonesome though, as we didn't see chuck nor
      child nor any living thing on the premises—(but I suppose it will be different when
      Lizzie<sup><a href="#nyp.00417_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> gets there)—but the jaunt about there &amp; the ride, made us a very pleasant three hours—Nothing
      new here—Your folks have been up to town twice this week—Van once &amp; your father once—they
      were all gathering apples for cider yesterday, &amp; to-day are burying the cabbages—Hieniken<sup><a href="#nyp.00417_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> comes over as usual (likes his cider)—this morning I went over to the school library
      &amp; got six or seven books—he took me—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I go around here the same as ever—jaunt in the woods &amp; loafe about a good deal, (but
      always sure to be back at meal time)—heavy storms this week two nights, but the days
      bright &amp; clear every time—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>&amp; you, dear son, how do you make out down there? We think &amp; speak about you often—as
      I write, the wind is blowing a south west gale around here—I suppose it is pretty
      cold at Atlantic<sup><a href="#nyp.00417_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—It is now ¼ after 1—the school children are playing &amp; making a great racket, &amp; I
      see Hiniekin just come down from his dinner—the shoemaker has been over for his pitcher
      of cider—and there I hear Ruth calling me to come to my dinner—so I must bid good
      bye to you for the present, &amp; God bless you, my darling son—
   </p>

   <p>I think of going up to Camden to-morrow or Sunday—most likely Sunday—Mont expects
      to go over with Ben Sharp soon—
