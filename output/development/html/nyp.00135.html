      My dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am anxious to obtain through you whatever copies of Engineering reports that you
      can send me without too much trouble. Particularly would I like to get the "Memoir
      on Foundations in Compressible soils by Rich Delafield"<sup><a href="#nyp.00135_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> lately publish[ed] by the Light House Bd.
   </p>
   
   <p>Such reports are of great use as they show what has been done, and particularly would
      any report on such a subject be useful to me just now &nbsp;Mr Davis<sup><a href="#nyp.00135_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> is associated with me here, and when you can duplicate the copies we would both be
      thankful
   </p>
   
   <p>I must beg pardon for my wholesale style of asking for these things—but being away
      from all advising engineers and when books on the subject cannot well be had (not
      worth much when had) I am forced to secure as best I can the records of the experience
      of others
   </p>
   
   <p>Please give my best regards to your wife—hoping that you are all well and again asking
      pardon for the trouble I may give you I remain
   </p>

      <br></br>Yours very truly Thos J Whitman
