      <br></br><br></br>Dear Herbert Gilchrist
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of the 10th came to-day &amp; is welcome. Every thing goes on much the same
      here. Quite biting wintry cold to-day after a long stormy spell. I am ab't the same
      as when you were here—&amp; am sitting by the window in the big chair. Mrs.
      D<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r1">1</a></sup> is well. We have been feasting on some nice stewed
      quinces and quince jelly—a triumph of Mrs. D's cookery—we wish you were
      here to have some—the very color goes beyond all description. I have no doubt
      the portrait fully justifies all encomiums there, and goes beyond them.<sup><a href="#upa.00088_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> —In a good light &amp; in a frame it must indeed
      appear well—having <u>neither</u> here, &amp; intentionally
      hung where it would be tested to the severest—Success to the painter of
      it—&amp; to it (the nobly carnal &amp; 
      Shaksperian
      
       work)—I have rec'd a nice letter from Herbert Horne<sup><a href="#upa.00088_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—have heard
      from Morgan Brown,<sup><a href="#upa.00088_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> who is well &amp; remains in N Y
      state—the Smiths are here, &amp; come to see me—Morse<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r5">5</a></sup> is here—has been here every day this week—Mrs. Stafford<sup><a href="#n0817" id="r6">6</a></sup> was here Wednesday, is well, as are all the family—But it
      is growing too dark to write—
   </p>
   
   <p><u>Sunday forenoon early—Oct 23</u>—The sun is shining
      bright—I have had my breakfast (pann'd oysters toast &amp; coffee) &amp; in
      half an hour I shall start in my light wagon &amp; Nettie<sup><a href="#upa.00088_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup> for Glendale—you ought to be here to accompany me—the air is full of
      sheen &amp; oxygen with a pleasant coolness—write soon again. Give my best
      regards to Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r8">8</a></sup>—a synopsis of his "New
      Poetry" lecture has been published here in the "Critic"<sup><a href="#upa.00088_n5" id="r9">9</a></sup>—Well I must be off—

   <p id="n6113">1. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,

   <p id="upa.00088_n1">2. Gilchrist's letter of
       was filled with comments on
      Whitman's portrait, including that of "Bernard Shawe, (a delightful Irishman who
      reviews books in the <em>Pall Mall</em> cleverly). . . . He
      thought there was a joyous spirited look about its execution." This portrait is
      now at the University of Pennsylvania.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="upa.00088_n2">3. Horne was a British author

   <p id="upa.00088_n3">4. Leonard M. Brown, a young
      English schoolteacher and friend of Herbert Gilchrist, came to America in May,
      1887. On  Gilchrist wrote to
      Whitman: "he is an uncommonly good fellow, quiet earnet serious soul and very
      practical, full of solid worth, whose knowledge and attainments are sure to be
      valued in America. His father is a clergyman, and this son of his reads Leaves
      of Grass silently &amp; unobserved by the sect of his orthodox family." An entry
      in Whitman's Commonplace Book on August 29 reads: "Leonard Morgan Brown goes
      back to Croton-on-Hudson—has been here ab't a week" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). See also Whitman's letter to Leonard Brown of ; his letter to Herbert Gilchrist

      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,

   <p id="n0817">6. Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
