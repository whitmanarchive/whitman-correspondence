      <br></br>Dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Probably you have forgotten me by this time. In the long "times gone by" you may
      remember me with some other lads who used to sit in your room in Myrtle [
      <span class="unclear">ave?</span>]
       &amp;
      hear you tell stories &amp; help you drink coffee. There was Joe Heyer, Bill
      Devoe,<sup><a href="#nyp.00131_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> your brother Jeff,<sup><a href="#n4995" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp;
      others. I remember well the first time I ever saw President Lincoln. You &amp; I
      stood talking on G St. (I think it was) near Secretary Chase's residence Washington.
      You said to me "There goes  Uncle Abe, I shall never forget [illegible] impression it made on me at the time. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I saw an article in the Sunday Eagle giving an account of an interview with you at
      your home in Camden which interested me very much. Joe Heyer loaned me the paper to
      read it &amp; by the by Joe works for us &amp; we often in speaking of old times,
      mention the days &amp; times we passed with our old friend Walt Whitman. I am
      collecting Photos of distinguished Americans &amp; would be glad to get one of
      yours, if it can be got. Joe has an Engraving of you which he prizes highly. If
      there is any published will you let me know. I suppose your time is occupied but I
      should dearly love to hear form you &amp; believe me to be

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04323_n2">1. This letterhead likely
      refers to Samuel G. Stanley and John F. Unckles's business, which was known as
      Stanley &amp; Unckles, Sash, Blind, and Door Manufacturers. It was located at
      the corner of Butler and Nevins in 1876; see <em>Important Events
         of the Century: Containing Historical and Important Events During the Last
         Hundred Years</em> (New York: United States Central Publishing Company,

      carpenter. He corresponded with Jeff as late as 1885. See the letter from Thomas

   <p id="n4995">3. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
