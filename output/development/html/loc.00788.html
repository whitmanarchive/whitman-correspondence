      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I wrote to Jeff Sunday last that his letters sent Sept 3d containing your letter &amp;
      $5 from Mr Lane had miscarried—this morning when I came down to Major Hapgood's office
      I found it on my table, so it is all right—singular where it has been all this while
      as I see the post mark on it is Brooklyn Sept 3 as Jeff said<sup><a href="#loc.00788_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Mother, what to do about Andrew I hardly know—as it is I feel about as much pity
      for you as I do for my poor brother Andrew, for I know you will worry yourself about
      him all the time—I was in hopes it was only the trouble about the voice &amp;c but I see
      I was mistaken, &amp; it is probably worse—I know you &amp; Jeff &amp; Mat will do all you can—&amp;
      will have patience with all (it is not only the sick who are poorly off, but their
      friends—but it is best to have the greatest forbearance, &amp; do &amp; give &amp;c whatever one
      can—but you know that, &amp; practice it too, dear mother)<sup><a href="#loc.00788_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, if I had the means, O how cheerfully I would give them, whether they availed
      any thing for Andrew or not—yet I have long made up my mind that money does not amount
      to so much, at least not so very much, in serious cases of sickness—it is judgment,
      both in the person himself, &amp; in those he has to do with—&amp; good heart is every thing—(Mother,
      you remember Theodore Gould,<sup><a href="#loc.00788_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> how he has stuck it out, though sickness &amp; death has had hold of him as you may say
      for fifteen years)—but any how I hope we will all do what we can for Andrew—Mother,
      I think I must try to come home for a month—I have not given up my project of lecturing,
      I spoke about before,<sup><a href="#loc.00788_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> but shall put it in practice yet, I feel clear it will succeed enough. (I wish I
      had some of the money already, it would be satisfaction to me to contribute something
      to Andrew's necessities, for he must have bread)—I will write to you of course before
      I come—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I hope you will live better—Jeff tells me you &amp; Jess &amp; Ed live on poor stuff,
      you are so economical<sup><a href="#loc.00788_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Mother, you mustn't do so, as long as you have a cent—I hope you will at least four
      or five times a week have a steak of beef or mutton, or something substantial for
      dinner—I have one good meal of that kind every day, or at least five or six days out
      of the seven—but for breakfast I never have any thing but a cup of tea &amp; some bread
      or crackers, (first rate tea though with milk &amp; good white sugar)—well I find it is
      hearty enough—more than half the time I never eat any thing after dinner, &amp; when I
      do it is only a cracker &amp; cup of tea—Mother, I hope you will not stint yourselves—as
      to using George's money for your &amp; Jess's &amp; Ed's needful living expenses, I know George
      would be mad &amp; hurt in his feelings, if he thought you was afraid to—Mother, now have
      a comfortable time as much as you can, &amp; get a steak occasionally, won't you?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose Mat got her letter last Saturday, I sent it Friday—O I was so pleased that
      Jeff was not drawn,<sup><a href="#loc.00788_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; I know how Mat must have felt too, &amp; you too—I have no idea the government will
      try to draft again, whatever happens—they have carried their point, but have not made
      much out of it—O how the conscripts &amp; substitutes are deserting down in front, &amp; on
      their way there—you don't hear any thing about it, but it is incredible—they don't
      allow it to get in the papers—Mother, I was so glad to get your letter, you must write
      again—can't you write to-morrow, so I can get it Friday or Saturday?—you know though
      you wrote more than a week ago I did not get it till this morning—I wish Jeff to write
      too, as often as he can—mother, I was gratified to hear you went up among the soldiers<sup><a href="#loc.00788_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—they are rude in appearance, but they know what is decent, and it pleases them much
      to have folks, even old women, take an interest &amp; come among them—mother, you must
      go again, &amp; take [Hat]—Well, dear mother, I must close—I am first rate in health,
      so much better than a month &amp; two mo's ago—my hand has entirely healed—I go to hospital
      every day, or night—I believe no men ever loved each other as I &amp; some of these poor
      wounded, sick &amp; dying men love each other—good bye, dearest mother, for present—

      Tuesday afternoon.
      </span>
   
   <p>Mother it seems to be certain that Meade has gained the day &amp; that the battles there
      in Pennsylvania have been about as terrible as any in the war— O what a sight must
      have been presented by the field of action—I think the killed &amp; wounded there on both
      sides were as many as eighteen or twenty thousand—in one place, four or five acres
      there were a thousand dead at daybreak on Saturday morning—mother one's heart grows
      sick of war, after all, when you see what it really is—every once in a while I feel
      so horrified &amp; disgusted—it seems to me like a great slaughter-house &amp; the men mutually
      butchering each other—then I feel how impossible it appears again to retire from this
      contest until we have carried our points—(it is cruel to be so tossed from pillar
      to post in one's judgement)—Washington is a pleasant place in some respects—it has
      the finest trees, &amp; plenty of them everywhere on the streets, &amp; grounds.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The Capitol grounds, though small, have the finest cultivated trees I ever see—there is a great variety, &amp; not one but is in perfect condition—after I finish this
      letter I am going out there for an hour's recreation—The great sights of Washington
      are the public buildings, the wide streets, the public grounds, the trees, the Smithsonian
      Institute &amp; grounds—I go to the latter occasionally—the Institute is an old fogy concern,
      but the grounds are fine—sometimes I go up to Georgetown, about two &amp; a half miles
      up the Potomac, an old town,—just opposite it in the river is an island where the
      niggers have their first Washington reg't encamped—they make a good show are often
      seen in the streets of Washington in squads—since they have begun to carry arms, the
      secesh here &amp; in Georgetown (about 3/5 there) are not insults to them as farmers
   </p>
   
   
   <p>One of the things here always on the go is long trains of army wagons—sometimes they
      will stream along all day, it almost seems as if there was nothing else but army wagons
      &amp; ambulances—they have great camps here in every direction of army wagons, teamsters,
      ambulance camps, &amp;c. Some of them are permanent &amp; have small hospitals—I go to them,
      (as no one else goes, ladies would not venture,)—I sometimes have the luck to give
      some of the drivers a great deal of comfort &amp; help—Indeed mother there are camps here
      of everything—I went once or twice to the contraband camp, to the Hospital, &amp;c. but
      I could not bring myself to go again—when I meet black men or boys among my own hospitals,
      I use them kindly, give them something &amp;c.—I believe I told you that I do the same
      to the wounded rebels, too—
      
      —but as there is a limit to one's sinews &amp; endurance &amp; sympathies &amp;c. I have got in
      the way after going all lightly as it were through the wards of a hospital &amp; trying
      to give a word of cheer if nothing else to everyone, then confining my special attentions
      to the few where the investment seems to tell best &amp; who want it most—Mother I have
      real pride in telling you that I have the consciousness of saving quite a little number
      of lives by saving them giving up &amp; being a good deal with them—the men say it is
      so &amp; the doctors say it is so—&amp; I will candidly confess I can see it is true, though
      I say it of myself—I know you will like to hear it mother, so I tell you—I am finishing
      this in Major Hapgood's office about 1 o'clock—it is pretty warm but has not cleared
      off yet—the trees look so well from where I am &amp; the Potomac it is a noble river.
      I see it several miles, &amp; Arlington heights—Mother I see some of the 47th Brooklyn
      every day or two—the reg't is on the Heights back of Arlington House, a fine camp
      ground—O Matty I have just thought of you—dear sister how are ou getting along?—Jeff
      I will write you truly—Good bye for the present dearest mother &amp; all—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00788_n1">1. Jeff wrote to Whitman
      twice on September 3 or 5, 1863; the  contained the contribution from Moses Lane; the , written in the evening after a visit to Dr.
      Ruggles with Andrew, arrived in Washington first.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00788_n2">2. Andrew's condition was
      rapidly deteriorating. Toward the end of August 1863 he went off to the country
      with one of his cronies, after he had gone on his first spree in three months.
      "He went home to get his things," Mrs. Whitman wrote to her son on September 3,
      "and nancy had not put them up. she told him to put them up himself and his
      having drank some he was very angry and he went away without taking any thing."
      Later in the same letter, the mother admitted that Andrew looked "very bad
      indeed," and reported that "he says he wouldent care about living only for his
      children. i think nance might do better at any rate. she might keep things a
      little cleaner" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books,
      Manuscript, and Special Collections Library).Jeff, devoting almost an entire
      letter to Andrew's illness, reported Dr. Ruggles' diagnosis: "That he could
      think of no medicine that would be likely to do him any good, That…what would
      cure him would be to take heart, go in the country again, and to resolve to get
      well." Jeff had proposed to his mother that she permit Andrew to occupy a room
      in her house while Martha nursed and fed him. Mrs. Whitman refused because she
      feared Andrew's entire family would move in. "I tell her to send the whole
      family back again, but she saing that 'she cant let him have it and that is the
      end of it.'…Perhaps it would not do any good, but I <em>think</em>
      it would save his life" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). Since the family was
      feuding, Mrs. Whitman, on September 3(?), suggested to Whitman, "Write on a
      piece of paper [apart?] from the letter if you say any thing you dont want all
      to read" (Trent Collection). Though he was tactful, Jeff was not pleased that
      Whitman remained in Washington and thus escaped direct participation in the
      family crisis: "What do you think about coming to Brooklyn. I think you better,
      for awhile any way. I wish you would write to Andrew" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection).<a href="#r2">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00788_n5">5. Jesse was not in good
      health, according to the mother's letter of September 3: "Jesse aint very well.
      he has such sick spells. he rocks the cradle for martha day in and day out"
      (Trent Collection). In his letter of the same day, Jeff agreed that Jesse was "a
      mere shadow of what he ought to be," but attributed the condition to his
      mother's frugality: "I have not the least doubt in my own mind that it all comes
      of his not having anything to eat that he can eat. Somehow or another, Mother
      seems to think that she ought to live without spending any money. Even to-day
      she has 25 or $30 in the house and I will bet that all they have for dinner will
      be a quart of tomats and a few cucumbers, and then Mother wonders why Jess
      vomits up his meals" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). See also notes to the
      letter from 
      .<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00788_n6">6. Jeff was not drafted, as
      he reported in the earlier letter on September 3: "I was not one of the elected,
      I feel thankful. In our ward the screws were put rather tight, out of a little
      over 3000 names they drew 1056, nearly one in three. . . . If this is the last
      of it I feel thankful but I believe Uncle Abe left off some on account of
      [Governor Horatio] Seymour, if so I suppose there will be another spurt. However
      we wont worry till the time comes" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). The letter
      to Martha is apparently lost.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00788_n7">7. Mrs. Whitman had noted
      that "there is part of two regments encamped on fort green. the indiana and 94th
      california . . . sis and i went up there this afternoon. poor fellows, they
      looked like hard times. i spoke to some of them" (Trent Collection).<a href="#r7">[back]
