      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I found your letter and Mrs Gilchrists<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r2">2</a></sup> and Mr Carpenters<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r3">3</a></sup> on my return, and we were
      much alarmed at first by reports, that you were very sick, but 
      yesterdays
      
       Ledger, I think gave the true thing, just about what you wrote to us. I
      hope by this time you are on the mend, and will be able to make your trip. I have
      had such a delightful time, no             
       heat, and we had no trouble on our
      trip, 
      every thing
      
       passed along pleasantly. It seems to me that if one were to travel
      the world over one could not find anything to compare with the Falls. Watkins Glen<sup><a href="#n3032" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      is wonderful too, we were fortunate in Hotels, and every thing, I brought home some views of the Glen and Falls. Aunt Libbie<sup><a href="#duk.00615_n7" id="r5">5</a></sup> is here
      still. Geo is well, in fact I never saw him look better, busy as ever, no time to
      ride much. Mrs Berry and family, have gone to 
      Moorestown to board this summer. Mrs
      Wetherbee is away in Boston, [
      <span class="unclear">Wht Marian Pains?</span>]
      , so our place is quiet. Mrs
      Wilson's infant is getting well. When I came home and found that the report was that
      you were very sick, I said that if I had known that, I would have gone to Canada,
      but the next day it was put in a milder way. I saw Mr Scovel<sup><a href="#n1049" id="r6">6</a></sup> in a street car the
      other day, I 
      beleive
      
       there is nothing else new. I can hardly tell about my trip, but when you
      return, it will be as well, and you have passed over so much of the same country.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      We all send love.
      <br></br>Lou
      
   </p>
   
   <p>hope you will
      write soon and tell us how you are

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0696">1. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (d. 1892), called "Loo" or
      "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their son,
      Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second son
      was stillborn. For more on Louisa, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0259">2. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0141b">3. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n3032">4. Watkins Glen is a gorge twenty
      miles west of Ithaca, New York, famous for its picturesque waterfalls.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n7">5. The "aunt" who was engaged
      to assist Louisa "Lou" Orr Haslam has not been identified. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman described Lou's aunt as English, and Louisa was not fond of the aunt's
      company: "i wouldent be very sorry if aunty wasent here" (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). She is named "aunt Lib" and "aunt Libby" in Louisa's  and  letters to Walt.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1049">6. James Matlock Scovel began to
      practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War he was in the New Jersey
      legislature, and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned actively for Horace
      Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S. Treasury during Chester
      Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home
      for Sunday breakfast, as he did on December 2 and 9, 1877 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a description of
      these breakfasts, see <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed.
      William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel,
      see George R. Prowell's <em>The History of Camden County, New
         Jersey</em> (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886).<a href="#r6">[back]
