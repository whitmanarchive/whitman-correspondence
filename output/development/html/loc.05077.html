      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend and Master
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You see I am now back in my own country.<sup><a href="#n1027" id="r1">1</a></sup> I had no idea that I
      would be so soon. I am staying, with my wife (I have been married about 18 months)
      at my father's house. We shall be here for some months now. There is great
      excitement in the country, but I think no likelihood of any serious disturbances.
      The people know the strength of England too well. I think the Land League<sup><a href="#loc.05077_n6" id="r2">2</a></sup> is slowly losing its influence here, and it deserves to.
      There never was an agitation conducted towards a more useful end or by worse means
      than this. From the very beginning the leaders of the people encouraged them to
      maintain  their
      organization by secret outrage and personal intimidation. There is not the slightest
      doubt that this was so. Their words may not have been arraignable by law, (though
      in
      many cases they were so) but they were such as their hearers could give but one
      interpretation to. "If a man takes a farm from which another has been evicted" says
      Mr. Dillon, "I don't think his cattle will prosper very much."<sup><a href="#loc.05077_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> And they don't, for in hundreds of cases these cattle
      have had wooden balls struck over with nails administered to them, have been driven
      over precipices, hamstrung, their eyes picked out. There is little violence just
      now, because the Land League is so all-powerful, and murder or violence is so
      certain to follow a breach of its rules, that no one ventures to transgress them.
      The speakers have in general terms condemned assassination in the sort of language
      which one would use to reprove excessive zeal, but they have never interfered  by word or deed
      to prevent any individual crime which was known to be intended, or condemned with
      energy any individual murder. There are 150 persons now whose lives would not be
      safe for one hour but for police protection, and no Land Leaguer will say one word
      to save them. I entirely agree with them in thinking that it is allowable of the
      tenants to repudiate unjust rents, and I would have thrown myself heart and soul
      into this movement if it were not founded upon crime of the most degrading and
      brutal kind. But as it is, I must say I think the Government are quite justified in
      bringing in their Protection Bill,<sup><a href="#loc.05077_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; the League has
      itself to blame for making that Bill necessary. I think too that once it receives
      a
      straight and severe blow its tyranny will be utterly broken, for it has largely
      ruled by terror and I do not believe that it has endeared itself to the people.
   </p>
   
   <p>Scribner has not taken 'Calvin Harlowe.'<sup><a href="#loc.05077_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> They might have
      done so if they had read it, but I suppose they don't read all the poetry they
      receive. Well for them, no doubt. You did not say anything about my
      translation of Epictetus which I sent you. I should like to know how you liked it.
      I
      am writing a preface for it now &amp; will try then &amp; find a publisher. I read news
      of the States with great interest. General Garfield seems a very good sort of man.
      What a puzzling question that is about the Chinese.<sup><a href="#loc.05077_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> I
      don't think it will get solved by any laws or treaties. I see your expected essay
      on
      the English poets of this century has never appeared.<sup><a href="#loc.05077_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      Was the announcement a mistake?
   </p>
   
   <p>Will you kindly send me a copy of the last edition of the "Leaves of Grass." I want
      it as a present for a friend, so don't write my name in the beginning.<sup><a href="#loc.05077_n7" id="r8">8</a></sup> Indeed the friend is my wife—so on second thoughts
      I would be glad, &amp; so would she, if you would write 'Edith Rolleston' in it. I'll
      send the 5 dollars as soon as I can get into some town. Please send to this
      address.
   </p>

      Yours always

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1027">1. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05077_n6">2. An Irish agrarian
      movement, organized in 1879 by Michael Davitt and led by Charles Parnell, the
      Land League agitated for land tenure reform and for the transferal of land
      ownership from British landholders to Irish tenants. The fight for fixity of
      tenure, fair rent, and free sale was accompanied by boycotting and violence,
      until the League was declared illegal. However, the group did carry the land
      question into the realm of practical politics and was an active force in
      bringing about the great land reform bills which culminated in the Land Purchase
      Act of 1903. See Michael Davitt, <em>The Fall of Feudalism in
         Ireland: or The Story of the Land League Revolution</em> (New York: Harper
      &amp; Brothers, 1904).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05077_n1">3. In the fall of 1880, the
      Land League discovered its most powerful weapon of attack—the boycott. The
      phrase Rolleston quotes here is commonly associated with a September 1880 speech
      by Land League President Charles Stewart Parnell (see, for instance, James M.
      Jasper, <em>The Art of Moral Protest</em> [Chicago: University of
      Chicago Press, 2008], 251–252), but Norman D. Palmer writes: "Apparently
      the subject was first referred to during the land campaign by John Dillon, who,
      speaking at Maryborough, Queen's County, on October 5, 1879, advised that if a
      tenant took a farm from which another had been evicted, no man should 'speak to
      him or have any business transaction with him.' And Dillon's words were repeated
      and elaborated on numerous occasions prior to September, 1880, by other
      spokesmen of the league" (<em>The Irish Land League Crisis</em>
      [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1940], 196). John Dillon (1851–1927),
      an Irish nationalist politician, was a very active member of the Land League and
      advocated a fighting policy for the organization. His tempestuous
      career—he was arrested several times and traveled extensively in his
      campaigns, even to America and Australia—was spent participating in
      various Irish nationalist groups: the Land League, the Irish National
      Federation, and the Nationalist Party.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05077_n4">4. The Protection of Life and
      Property (Ireland) Bill was passed by the British Government in 1881 to cope
      with the agitation of the Land League. With this "Coercion Act," the Habeas
      Corpus Act was suspended and authorities were given the power to imprison any
      "reasonably suspected" person.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05077_n2">5. Whitman had recieved the
      poem "Calvin Harlowe," attached to the letter Rolleston sent him on . Apparently, Whitman liked the
      poem, noting the receipt with the words "fine ballad" on the envelope of the
      letter. The poem was eventually published in <em>Kottabos</em>,
      4.1 (1882), 1–2. See the letter from Rolleston to Whitman of .<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05077_n3">6. Probably an allusion to the
      "Morey letter," a document allegedly written by James A. Garfield that surfaced
      during the 1880 election. It was first called "Garfield's Death Warrant" because
      the letter's author advocated extended Chinese immigration. Garfield denied
      authorship and, since in 1879 Garfield had opposed a Chinese exclusion law, his
      position on the subject was known, and the piece was quickly believed to be a
      forgery (John I. Davenport, <em>History of the Forged "Morey
         letter"</em> [New York: John I. Davenport, 1884]). The episode, however,
      does indicate the contemporary disturbance over Chinese immigration. In 1880, a
      treaty was signed providing for regulation or suspension of immigration but not
      its absolute prohibition, and two years later, in 1882, the Chinese Exclusion
      Act was passed.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05077_n5">7. See the <em>Academy</em> 18 (1880), 238: "Walt Whitman will shortly give in one of the
      London magazines his estimate of the leading English poets of the nineteeth
      century." Rolleston noted the announcement in his letter to Whitman of .<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05077_n7">8. Above this word, Whitman
      wrote: "sent."<a href="#r8">[back]
