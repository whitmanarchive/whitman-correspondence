   <p>I kept elaborating the Dutch art. It is now in Clement's hands (ed. Transcript) &amp;
      will appear soon I guess. I read up Taine's rich little "Art in the Netherlands,"
      &amp;c &amp; have made a [illegible] bit of
      work I think. I am not much in touch with Miss Gilder<sup><a href="#n0264" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; her
      dilettante [
      <span class="unclear">shut?</span>]
      . So
      tho't I cd read the proof of article better in Transcript
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have wanted to say for long that I have read 3 lines yr excellent article in
      Critic. Its choice &amp; weighty diction makes us fellows despair. Walt, you have
      <u>gained</u>
      <u>not lost one whit</u>, as a prose writer. As for poetry, it
      must come when man is at the [
      <span class="unclear">loft?</span>]
       of his condition you know.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
