   </p>
   
   <p>The corrections you specified have been or will be made, for future printing—(I
      wish you would notify me of any others you see also)<sup><a href="#nyp.00490_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—The book is to be published simultaneously here and in London 
      Eng.
      
       on the 15th June.<sup><a href="#nyp.00490_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Typographically, &amp; in
      get up, binding &amp;c. the experts all pronounce it a success—it is generally
      taken for an <em>imported</em> book, (if that is any
      compliment)—the wonder is not that there are a few errors &amp;
      plate-breakages—but that there are <em>so</em>
      few—your part looks &amp; <em>is</em> even better than I
      anticipated from the proofs—more tremendous—the 1883 Letter is <em>vitalest</em> of all—it is like the Old French Revolution of
      '93<sup><a href="#nyp.00490_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—long, long its provocation &amp;
      reason-why—stands there, something, <em>the
         only</em>—an immense prologue before it &amp; an immense epilogue after, &amp;
      it but a speck in the middle between—an exception—but <em>enough</em>, the mark, the inerasable warning, for a thousand years—
   </p>
   
   <p>The printed notice enclosed is from a scholar &amp; staunch friend—a Yankee <em>litterateur</em>—W. S. K.—if you feel to do so, <em>I wish you would write him a few words</em>—he is
      worthy—Say that I sent you the criticism—his address is
      <br><br><em>Wm Sloane Kennedy</em>
      <br><em>Cambridge Mass:</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00490_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I am well. Did you see the <em>Critic</em> June 9?<sup><a href="#nyp.00490_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> I saw the <em>Tribune</em> notice.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00490_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd June 15/83." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service |
      Treasury | Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Philadelphia | Pa. | Jun 13 83 |
      6 30 PM; Washington, Recd. | Jun | 14 | 4 30 AM | 1883 | 2.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00490_n2">2. Apparently a reference to
      the errors cited in O'Connor's letter of May 23 (Oscar Lion Collection, New York
      Public Library). Whitman did not allude to Jeannie's death which O'Connor
      reported in the same letter (see the letter from Whitman to O'Connor of ). However, O'Connor on May 14
      informed Richard Maurice Bucke of the details of his daughter's death and of "a
      bad attack of inflammatory rheumatism," which incapacitated him for the rest of
      the year (The Library of Congress, Washington D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00490_n3">3. The book was published on
      June 15 in London and on June 20 in Philadelphia (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.; see also the letter from Whitman to
      O'Connor of ).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00490_n4">4. In a letter of , O'Connor considered Whitman's comparison
      "magnificent and happy" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953],
      4:162).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00490_n5">5. On  O'Connor promised to write to William
      Sloane Kennedy as soon as his hand healed.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00490_n6">6. The June 9 issue of <em>The Critic</em> contained a review of Bucke's book.<a href="#r6">[back]
