   <p>Thanks for your kind contribution &amp; note.<sup><a href="#med.00699_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> The help I
      seek is for Louis Fitzgerald Tasistro—he has paralysis—&amp; has had a
      miserable winter, cold &amp; hungry—(I have myself been absent great part of the
      winter)—But he is now up &amp; comparatively better—your kind $5 will truly
      aid in ameliorating his condition—
   </p>

   <p id="med.00699_n1">1. On April 26, 1872,
      Whitman inserted an appeal in the Washington <em>Daily Morning
         Chronicle</em> for "pecuniary assistance for a man of genius" (see the
      letter from Whitman to Samuel Ward of ). This person was Louis Fitzgerald Tasistro (1808–1886), an
      Irish-born journalist, actor, State Department translator, and lecturer (<em>Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</em>, ed. Edward
      F. Grier [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 2:901).<a href="#r1">[back]
