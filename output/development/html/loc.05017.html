   <p>Thank you, my dear friend,<sup><a href="#loc.05017_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> for sending Washington Star
      with that good-tasting little paragraph (like the bouquet of a tiny glass of rare
      wine at the right moment.)

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05017_n1">1. This letter bears the
      address: Paymaster | John S Cunningham | USN | Office 425 Chestnut Street |
      Philadelphia. It is postmarked: Camden | Jan | 27(?) | 7 AM | N.J.;
      Philadelphia, Pa. | Jan | 27 | 8 AM | Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05017_n2">2. In his Commonplace Book,
      Whitman referred to a "card-note" to Cunningham, whose name card was mounted
      opposite the entries for this period (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
      There is only one other reference to Cunningham in the Commonplace Book: on June
      22, 1882, he was stationed at Wakefield, R.I. The article in the <em>Washington Evening Star</em> of January 21 quoted Wilde: "I
      think Mr. Whitman is in every way one of the greatest and strongest men who have
      ever lived."<a href="#r2">[back]
