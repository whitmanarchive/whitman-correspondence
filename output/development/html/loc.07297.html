   <p>I have been as busy as a nailer all day (if it is Sunday)<sup><a href="#loc.07297_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—just going out for a drive and write this line to take with me and post. We
      have had a glorious day—bright and warm—There is nothing to tell you
      except that we are all well and the asylum and its affairs are quiet and prosperous.
      I trust you are something easier by this time. I had a long cheery letter from Mrs.
      Gosling<sup><a href="#loc.07297_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> (do you recollect her in '80 when you were
      at the asylum? She is a great friend of yours) from Birmingham, England where she
      is
      living now with her husband &amp; little girl.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07297_n1">1. In 1889, April 14th fell on
      a Sunday, and Bucke is likely referencing a popular expression.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.07297_n2">2.  The name of Mrs. Gosling is
      written in Whitman's Commonplace-Book, as are those of several other residents
      of London, Ontario. This entry is not dated, but follows that for June 19, 1880
      and precedes the entry for July 1880 (<em>The
