      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of 29th Dec. with <em>the present</em> came safe to-day—Believe me I feel the gift, &amp; it comes just right too—John, please
      forward the enclosed slip to unknown friend<sup><a href="#sjs.00010_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The above is a fair picture of the great Mississippi Bridge, East St Louis, where
      I have loafed many hours—only it sets up <em>much higher</em> than the print gives—I dont believe there can be a grander thing of the kind on earth<sup><a href="#sjs.00010_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jan 4<sup><a href="#sjs.00010_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I leave here Sunday morning at 8, on my return east, &amp; shall be due in Philadelphia
      Monday evening, before 8—The last two or three weeks I have been well, for me, &amp; am
      so now—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter was deeply interesting to me, made me see Emerson no doubt just as he
      is, the good pure soul—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>John, I sympathize with you in the arm, &amp; the treatment too—</p>
   
   
   <p>A great thaw &amp; dense fog here as I write—</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="sjs.00010_n1">1. James T. Fields wrote to
      Burroughs on December 22, 1879, about sending Walt Whitman "a small Christmas
      remembrance in money [$100] . . . There is no occasion for his being told who
      sends it" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
      189). On  Burroughs sent the gift
      without mentioning the donor's name (The John Rylands Library, Manchester,
      England). On  Richard Maurice Bucke had
      offered the poet $100 as a gift or a loan. Whitman wrote on the letter: "Kind
      letter from Dr Bucke offering money (declined with thanks)" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="sjs.00010_n3">3. Whitman undoubtedly meant
      to write "Jan 3," since Sunday was the fourth (<em>Walt Whitman:
         The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 3:172).<a href="#r3">[back]
