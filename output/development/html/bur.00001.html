   <p>I got in all right before sundown—Still keep well, (&amp; all the better for my
      Esopus trip—&amp; the berries, &amp;c.)<sup><a href="#bur.00001_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>—Yesterday went on a sail down the
      bay to Sandy Hook with some Sorosis ladies &amp; only a few men—a real
      sea-sail, sea-breeze &amp;c—(I went up in the Pilot house most of the time
      with the pilots)—had dinner on board—I enjoyed it, but was pretty
      tired—got in before dark—

   <p>—Shall stay here a few days longer—find it hard to get away,—John, I
      send you a slip cut from the <em>Tribune</em>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="bur.00001_n1">1. Whitman went to New
      York to attend the funeral of William Cullen Bryant on June 14, 1878, and stayed
      with John H. Johnston, a jeweler and old friend. As the letter indicates,
      Whitman paid a visit to John Burroughs before he returned to New York, where he
      remained until July 10. See Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller (New York: New York
      University Press, 1964), 3:120–128.<a href="#r1">[back]
