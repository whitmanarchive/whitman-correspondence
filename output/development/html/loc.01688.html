   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received your letter of the 14th. So you are going to Kansas, &amp; it would
      seem you think of settling there—so it may be we shall not see each
      other—but I wish you to write to me, &amp; let me know how it goes with
      you—&amp; I hope, dear boy, you will continue to remember me with a love
      which time shall not fade out.
   </p>

      <br></br><br></br>My dear friends,
      <br></br>N. M. and J. B. Pratt,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I appreciate your kindness &amp; your hospitable invitations, &amp; I am sure it
      would be a good change &amp; a comfort to me to come out &amp; see you, &amp; be
      with you a few days, surrounded with new scenery, &amp; a farm life—it is what
      I should enjoy of all things—and I hope things may work so that I can come one
      of these days—if so, I will send you word, in advance—The picture of the
      dear daughter will be welcome—I should also like another of my dear loving boy
      Alfred, as soon as he gets any late ones, if he does so—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So good bye &amp; God bless you, my dear friends, &amp; my love to all.</p>

      On , Alfred spoke of his
      departure for Kansas, and John offered to send a picture of his "daughter,"
      whom Alfred had married in August 1868: "She ways about 100 lbs and is as
      handsome as a picture." (A picture of Alfred and his wife at the time of
      their marriage is in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) He
      concluded: "please write soon to your unworthy friends" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). On , John informed Walt Whitman that Alfred had left on January 25,
      1870, and had settled in "Douglass," Kansas. This was apparently the last
      letter in the correspondence.<a href="#r1">[back]
