      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I came up last night from a three days visit to White Horse<sup><a href="#pml.00046_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—went down thinking only to spend the day, but the spring beauty of the creek, skies,
      weather, trees, birds &amp;c. fascinated me—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am feeling excellent well to-day, for me—have been out to a gay breakfast party (lawyers &amp; ladies &amp; lots of talk,
      &amp; champagne)<sup><a href="#pml.00046_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—&amp; enjoyed it very well—but <em>once</em> of such a thing will last me a long while—got home about one o'clock, (it has now
      just struck four)—consequence of my gay breakfast is, I have not eat any dinner—but
      shall go to Col. Johnston's to supper<sup><a href="#pml.00046_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thanks to Herbert for his good letters of the 7th from Brooklyn—&amp; the 16th from Northampton<sup><a href="#pml.00046_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—please give him the enclosed postal, I found at White Horse—May-be you will like
      to read Miss Hillard's letter—so I enclose it—The Staffords are mostly as usual—George
      S. not very well, but around at work—Debbie not married yet<sup><a href="#pml.00046_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You must have fine surroundings indeed at Round Hill—As I close we have the prospect
      of a fine evening—A cannon has just boomed out on the river, probably an ocean-steam
      just come in, firing her signal gun—&amp; I am just off to Col. J's, &amp; to leave this at
      the P O—
   </p>
