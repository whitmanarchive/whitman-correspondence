   <p>A bright sky, but a very cold day—ice remains firm on the shade side of the
      street. I have been striving to raise enough to buy ½ tin of coal—quite
      exhausted—more so than at any time this season.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Han<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r1">1</a></sup> is despondent, weak, very nervous; you must expect her to reply, even by postal
      to your kind notes—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The paper you maild to her was very encouraging, and she craves for a couple of rooms
      near you—that she might furnish, and enjoy with you the bright Camden
      sunshine—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I am quite broken down at times; irritable from this epidemic—I make two coal
      fires and have the sitting room and 
      kichen
      
       well warmed, when she comes down, but a man is not precisely the kind of
      servant a woman needs. Mrs. Church<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r2">2</a></sup> is very clever but she has a house full of
      boarders. She is very thorough and competent.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am puzzled at times how to continue—I sleep well—yet I need rest other
      ways. I feel at times that I shall be compelled to give up—I have something
      like the 
      eumonia
      
       at times too, in my left chest. I have no physician.
