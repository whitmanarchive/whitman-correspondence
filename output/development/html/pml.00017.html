      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of the 8th has just come. I am glad indeed to hear that you are free from asthma,
      &amp; are feeling well.
   </p>
   
   <p>I should be truly happy to become acquainted with Mrs. Andrews<sup><a href="#pml.00017_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I am sure I should like her much.
   </p>
   
   <p>For a month or so, I have not been very well—my trouble takes the form, sometimes,
      of neuralgia—but is a complication—(the doctor says it probably all dates from that
      time I got saturated with hospital malaria)—But I keep around, &amp; go to the office
      just the same—&amp; now for four of five days have felt much better—
   </p>
   
   <p>The O'Connors are well—The consul at Rio Janeiro is James Munroe—Our Minister to Brazil,
      resident in Rio Janeiro, is James Watson Webb.<sup><a href="#pml.00017_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I send my love to Helen and Emmy &amp; all—I have rec'd a letter from mother to-day—she
      seems to be about the same as usual—I hope Helen or Emmy will just go over &amp; visit
      her without ceremony as often as possible. Give my respects to Mr. Arnold<sup><a href="#pml.00017_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>—also to Mr. Price—It would give me the greatest pleasure to see you or Helen here
      in Washington. I rec'd your friend's (Katy Hinds)<sup><a href="#pml.00017_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> letter at the time—I have had no letter from Mr. Parker's family<sup><a href="#pml.00017_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup>—I am writing this by my window in the office—it is a fine view, ten miles of river,
      &amp; away across to Virginia hills, ever so far—My place is an easy &amp; pleasant one here
      in the Att'y Gen's. office—And now for the present, dear friend, Farewell.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Abby H. Price
      (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
      husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
      children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
      age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
      were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
      Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for
      the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother in <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 (1908): 163–169. In a letter to Ellen M.
      O'Connor from , Whitman declared
      with emphasis, "<em>they are all friends</em>, to prize and love
      deeply."
