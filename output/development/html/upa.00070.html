   <p id="upa.00070_n1">1. This postcard bears the
      address: Herbert Gilchrist | 112 Madison avenue | New York City. It is
      postmarked: Esopus | (?).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="upa.00070_n2">2. Whitman stayed with
      Burroughs from April 23 to May 3, 1879 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). A report of his journey appeared in the New York
      <em>Tribune</em> on May 17 under the heading, "Real Summer
      Openings"; most of the material was included in <em>Specimen
         Days</em> (ed. Floyd Stovall [New York: New York University Press, 1963],
      190–196, 339–341). Burroughs was particularly delighted with what
      was to be Whitman's last visit to Esopus-on-Hudon: "The weather has been nearly
      perfect, and his visit has been a great treat to me—April days with Homer
      and Socrates for company" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
      184).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00070_n3">3. The report in the New
      York <em>Tribune</em> included two paragraphs describing
      Burroughs's son, Julian, passages omitted in <em>Specimen
         Days</em> (Stovall, 339–340).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00070_n4">4. On April 28, 1879,
      Whitman visited Professor Frédéric Louis Ritter (1834–1891),
      professor of music and art at Vassar College. Mrs. Ritter, a musician and a
      friend of William D. O'Connor, invited Whitman to visit her in a letter to
      O'Connor on April 26, 1876 (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914], 3: 483–484). Her
      letter "was on rose tinted paper in a pale green envelope, and perfumed like
      Arabia Felix," or so O'Connor described it to Burroughs on May 4, 1876.
      Professor Ritter composed a musical setting for "Dirge for Two Veterans" (see
      the letter from Whitman to John Burroughs of , and Barrus, 355).<a href="#r4">[back]
