      sun, cold, dry winter day—America continues generally busy enough all over her
      vast demesnes (<em>intestinal agitation</em> I call it)—talking,
      plodding, <em>making money</em>, every one trying to get
      on—perhaps to get toward the top—but no special individual

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00727_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Ernest Rhys | Care Walter Scott 24 Warwick Lane | Paternoster Row | London |
      England. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | Jan 23 | 6 AM | 90; London E.C. | C |
      Fe 3 90 | AK.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00727_n2">2. This letter originally
      appeared in <em>The Correspondence of Walt Whitman, Volume 5:
         1890-1892</em>. That version was based on a transcript that appeared in <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> (8 February 1890) and that Whitman used
      in <em>Good-bye My Fancy</em> (1890). The current transcription,
      which appeared <em>The Correspondence, Volume 6: A Supplement with
         a Composite Index</em>, is based on the manuscript letter in The Henry W.
      and Albert A. Berg Collection of English and American Literature, New York
      Public Library. The transcription of the manuscript letter reinstates Whitman's
      salute as well as the first line. It also reveals that the line stating "America
      continues generally busy enough..." was changed to "America continues—is
      generally busy enough..." in <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00727_n3">4. The slips Whitman is
      referring to are most likely copies of "," which appeared in the February issue
      of the <em>Century</em> magazine. The poet sent "slips" to Mary
      Smith Costelloe, as well as her brother and father. See his  letter to her.<a href="#r4">[back]
