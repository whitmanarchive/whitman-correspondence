      <br></br><br></br>Dear son,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wrote you a letter last Tuesday, 6th, which I suppose you have rec'd. The last I
      have
      from you was yours of Sunday, 4th. I am still here in Brooklyn, quite busy with the
      printing. I have rec'd a letter from John Rowland who is working for me in the office,
      complaining that he has to work too hard—I should think by his letter he means to
      back
      out of his bargain with me—if so, it will be a bad loss &amp; inconvenience to
      me—But I shall not fret about it—whatever happens. It is likely that this will
      shorten my leave, &amp; that I shall have to come back &amp; do my work myself, about the
      end of the month. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear Pete, I hope you are having good times, &amp; are in good spirits. We are having
      quite
      coolish weather here. The drivers wear their overcoats mornings &amp; evenings. As I sit
      here writing Friday afternoon, it is cloudy &amp; threatens rain. I am going over to New
      York in an hour or so, &amp; shall leave this in the P. O., and then go around
      awhile—possibly going to Niblo's Theatre<sup><a href="#n0442" id="r2">2</a></sup>, as they play Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar"
      to-night, with Davenport &amp; quite a bunch of stars in the piece<sup><a href="#loc.01531_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Son, I am afraid I shall not make out much of a letter this time—but you take it so
      hard when I don't write, I thought I would send a few lines—they would be better than
      nothing—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>God bless you, my loving boy—&amp; farewell for this time. </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <p id="n0442">2. Walt Whitman did not see this play on September
      9, 1870, since that was the one evening in the week on which it was not
      presented. The cast included Edward Loomis Davenport as Brutus. Lawrence
      Barrett as Cassius, and Walter Montgomery as Marc Antony.<br><br>
      Niblo's Theatre was built in 1834 by coffeehouse owner William Niblo as a way
      to supplement the entertainment value of his refreshment "resort." Rebuilt
      in 1849 after an 1846 fire, Niblo's Theatre saw a significant increase in
      business after the Civil War. It was destroyed in another fire in 1872,
      later rebuilt by Alexander Turney Stewart (1903–1876) before closing
      in 1895 to make way for an office building for sugar refiner Henry Osborne
      Havemeyer (1847–1907).<a href="#r2">[back]
