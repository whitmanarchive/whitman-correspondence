   <p>Your postal card was duly received.—I got all your papers and very glad of them.
      Especially the Boston Transcripts, Critics, Liberty &amp;c—I am glad to see the
      notices of William<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> that appear occasionally, but they give a
      very faint idea of the man to those who knew him best—If I had power of
      literary expression I would try to write something—If you had your health and
      strength I know you could give just the right touches which would preserve the
      portrait of an uncommonly gifted mind—John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      might do it but he lacks sympathy I think with certain fiery and vivid types of
      which Wm. was a bright exemplar.—But perhaps it is just as well. "The silent
      organ loudest chants the masters requiem"<sup><a href="#loc.02029_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am going up and down this fair land and watching the vintage "from which streams
      of
      brandy do flow. By which I only mean that they are gathering and pressing 
      grapes in all the
      vineyards—1000 acre vineyards not uncommon with five tons of grapes to the
      acre—and from the new wine brandy is largely distilled, we are in the height
      of brandy making season with which the internal revenue department is largely
      concerned—
   </p>
   
   <p>Saw your interview with Edwin Arnold<sup><a href="#n6163" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      and much touched by it.—The applause of other nations, if not your own, begins
      to be heard in your declining years. May every comfort and blessing gather around
      you as your steps grow slow brother beloved.—I hope to see you next year.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

   <p id="loc.02029_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked: San Francisco, Cal | Oct 8
      | 11 AM | 89; Camden, NJ | Oct | 14 | 6[illegible] | 1889 | [illegible].<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">3. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
