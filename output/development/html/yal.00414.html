   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have had one or two quite good spells—but am not feeling well just now—have
      got over to the office, &amp; am now sitting at my desk—it is a rainy day here, not
      very cool—Mother, I have nothing particular to write to-day either—but thought I
      would send just a few lines, as you might like to get something—The season is quite
      advanced here—pleasant the past few days, I have been out in the cars every day. I
      have not written very lately either to Jeff<sup><a href="#n0710" id="r2">2</a></sup> or Hannah<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, Mammy dear, how are you getting along at Camden<sup><a href="#yal.00414_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup>—&amp; how are Lou<sup><a href="#n0368" id="r5">5</a></sup> and George<sup><a href="#n0700" id="r6">6</a></sup>—I often wish you were here,
      mother dear, as it would be such a relief to me to have you where I could see you,
      &amp;
      talk a while—I think there is no doubt that, take the time right through, I gain
      steadily, though very slowly indeed—but I get many tedious spells, both of head &amp;
      limbs—there seems to be great deal of paralysis—I hear, or read of cases, every
      day—One man here to-day told me of his father, who had a very bad stroke at 70 years
      of age, but got over it after all, and lived 17 or 18 years after, by great care—So
      I
      hear of many cases, some good, some unfavorable—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As to myself, I do not lose faith for a moment, in my ultimate recovery—though, as
      I
      said, I have some bad hours—sometimes very bad—Well, mama dear, I have scribbled
      out this sheet nearly, such as it is—I sent you a letter last Monday<sup><a href="#yal.00414_n2" id="r7">7</a></sup>—I have changed the address on the envelopes to you, mother,
      as you see<sup><a href="#yal.00414_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup>—is it right?—I am feeling better—my
      head is some easier—Love to you, dear mama, &amp; all—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0710">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890), known as
      "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
      eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
      recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
      marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
      correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
      together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Matty) in 1873 and
      his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
      his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!" For
      more on Thomas Jefferson Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0285">3. Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908),
      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="yal.00414_n1">4. On , Louisa Van Velsor Whitman complained that George "has never
      given me 50 cts since i have been 
      heere
      
      ," and marveled that her son, who once did as he pleased, "gives the
      strictest account of every thing." Of Lou she wrote: "god forgive me if i judge
      wrongfully but i 
      dont
      
       think there is much the matter." She was correct: Louisa was not
      pregnant.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0368">5. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n0700">6. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      following: "I hope you will have a pleasant Sunday."<a href="#r7">[back]
