   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.

         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4195">1. Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), a volume Whitman often referred to
      as the "big book," was published by Philadelphia publisher David McKay in
      December 1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, he made the presswork and
      binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the book, which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more information on
      the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03566_n1">2.  Horace Traubel records
      Whitman's first reactions to the new book in Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.3.html">Wednesday, January 23, 1889</a>. Also, on , Whitman wrote to Bucke: "a handsome substantial
      volume—not that I am overwhelmed or even entirely satisfied by it, but as
      I had not put my calculations high &amp; was even expecting to be disappointed,
      I shall accept it."<a href="#r2">[back]
