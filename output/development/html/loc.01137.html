      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:       
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you a little remembrancer—enough to pay your expenses up here when you get
      ready to come, which I hope will be before long. I have recd reminders from you from time to time in the shape of papers &amp;c, which I have been
      glad to get. I see about all that is in the <u>Tribune</u> as I take the semi-weekly  The sketch of Carlyle in the
      
      
      
      London paper was the best I have seen, your own words upon his death were very noble
      &amp; touching. It was a proper thing for you to do &amp; it became you well The more one
      reads &amp; knows of Carlyle the more one loves &amp; reverences him. He was worth all other
      Britains put together to me. What have we to do with his opinions? He was a towering
      &amp; god like man &amp; that was enough. He is to be judged as a poet &amp; prophet, &amp; not as
      a molder of opinion. He was better &amp; greater than any opinion he could have. His style
      too
      
      
      
      I would not have different True it was not the "Mary-had-a-little-lamb" style of most
      of his critics, any more than your own prose style is, but grand &amp; manly &amp; full of
      thunder &amp; lightning.

   <p>The robins are just here, &amp; the ice on the river is moving this afternoon, bag &amp; baggage.
      Ursula is still in N.Y. but is doing pretty well &amp; hopes to be home soon. Julian &amp; I have all sorts of ups
      &amp; downs. I am correcting the proof of <u>Pepacton</u> &amp; writing an article for <u>Scrib</u> on Thoreau. I first wrote them
      
      
      
      a notice of his Journal just published, which they were pleased to say was too good
      for a book notice &amp; that I must make a body article out of it &amp;c. <u>Scrib</u>. has displayed some remarkable journalistic enterprise lately—they have got from
      <u>Emerson</u> his article on Carlyle for their May no. This is <u>sub rosa</u> &amp; is not for the public yet. I enclose you a slip of the article or lecture which
      you may have seen. I do not think his trip hammer with the Aeolian attachment figure
      conceived in the highest spirit. It is so preposterous &amp; impossible that it spoils
      it for me, but it raps
      soundly upon the attention for a moment, &amp; I suppose that is enough for his purpose.

   <p>I hope your cloud lifts as spring comes &amp; that you are better. If you see young Kennedy
      tell him I will write to him again by &amp; by. I guess he is a good fellow, but he needs
      hetcheling to get the toe out the flax. How do you like him? I shall want a set of your books by &amp; by.
