   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd a letter to–day from Moncure Conway<sup><a href="#n0170" id="r1">1</a></sup> (just 
      arr'd
      
       here from England) in which this was 
      enc'd
      
      —you being 
      ment'd
      
       in it.<sup><a href="#yal.00419_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I jog on about the same—(frequent bad spells—but still up &amp; around after a
      fashion.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pleasant September days &amp; nights here—I have just been out for an hour on the
      river—now, 2 p. m., sitting here by open window, middling comfortable—
   </p>

      American abolitionist and frequent correspondent with Walt Whitman. Conway often
      acted as Whitman's agent and occasional public relations man in England. For
      more on Conway, see Philip W. Leon, ""<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_182.html">Conway Moncure Daniel (1832–1907)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="yal.00419_n1">2. This letter was written on the verso of a
      letter from William Bell Scott to Conway, dated August 21, 1875. William Michael
      Rossetti had dedicated his edition of Walt Whitman's poems to Scott.<a href="#r2">[back]
