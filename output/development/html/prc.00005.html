      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>My book has been delayed among the printers,—but I shall stay till it is all printed—it
      is a little over half done, &amp; they promise that it shall be done, or mainly so, this
      week. If convenient, send me a draft for the $100. If practicable send a draft payable
      to me, at Atlantic National 
      
      
      
      Bank, of Brooklyn, New York. Write me a note separate, also. Direct to me at 279 East
      55th street, New York City.
   </p>
   
   <p>The book is going to suit me pretty well—it will make a volume of 500 pages, size
      &amp; style &amp; type, &amp;c fully equal to Drum Taps.—I shall feel glad enough when it is completed—I
      have a constant struggle with the printers—They are good fellows &amp; willing enough—but
      it seems impossible to prevent them 
      
      
      making lots of ridiculous errors—it is my constant dread that the book will be disfigured
      in that way—though we have got along pretty well thus far—I rec'd a letter from William
      O'Connor, &amp; wrote him in return.—I shan't be back for nine or ten days.
   </p>
   
   <p>Remember 279 East 55th street, New York City.</p> 
   
   <p>I have been well &amp; hearty. My mother is pretty well for an old woman of 72—John, I
      hope this will find you, &amp; the wife too
      
      
      in good health. I send you both my love.—The weather is perfect here, &amp; if it wasn't
      for the worriment of the book, I should be as happy as a clam at high water, as they
      say down on old Long Island.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
