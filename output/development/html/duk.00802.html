   </p>
   
   <p>I return the MS—It has a magnificence of strength, <em>originality &amp; suggestion</em>—&amp; I adhere fully to what I advised
      in my former note<sup><a href="#duk.00802_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I think a synopsis of V[ictor]
      H[ugo] and T[ennyson] with the other parts—&amp; then this MS. brought in as
      the reason for writing synopsis—just the same as Homer?<sup><a href="#duk.00802_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> compiles the first 18 books of the Iliad, purely to
      bring in the remain[in]g 6—your main matter—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
