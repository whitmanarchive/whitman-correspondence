   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01707_n1">1. William Conant Church
      (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
      York newspapers until he founded <em>The Army and Navy
         Journal</em> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
      he established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. Financial control of
      the <em>Galaxy</em> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
      was absorbed by the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1878. W. C.
      published a biography of his life-long friend U.S. Grant in 1897, and F. P.
      wrote for the New York <em>Sun</em> the unsigned piece "Yes,
      Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." See E. F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic Vistas</em>,"
