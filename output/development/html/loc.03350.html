      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was so impressed with the letter Mr. Stetson<sup><a href="#n6144" id="r2">2</a></sup> wrote a year ago about the calendar,
      that I got Grace<sup><a href="#n6143" id="r3">3</a></sup> to send it to me from California, and enclose
      you a copy, thinking you might like to see it. You can return it sometime, as I have
      sent back the original.
   </p>
   
   <p>It does not say much, to be sure, but it has large import, and makes me long for such
      a mind to do the calendar. Don't you think so?
   </p>
   
   <p>—The eye is as bad as ever, and I see with difficulty.</p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Goodbye,
      <br></br>Always faithfully.
      <br></br>W. D. O'C

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n6144">2. Charles Walter Stetson
      (1858–1911) was a visual artist, often described as a "colorist." He
      married writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman in 1884, and the couple divorced
      amicably in 1894. Soon after, he married Grace Ellery Channing.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6143">3. Grace Ellery Channing
      (1862–1937) was a writer and editor. She was the niece of William D.
      O'Connor. In 1894 she married artist Charles Walter Stetson, soon after his
      divorce from Channing's lifelong friend, writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman. After
      her initial refusal to ever read Whitman's work, Channing became enthralled by
      the poet's words and, in 1887, had the idea of creating an illustrated calendar
      with excerpts from <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. The illustrations
      would be made by Walter Stetson. The project was never realized. For more on the
      calendar project, see see Joann Krieg, "Grace Ellery Channing and the Whitman
      Calendar," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 12:4 (1995),
      252–256. Channing published her own volume of Whitman-inspired poetry
      titled <em>Sea-Drift</em> in 1899.<a href="#r3">[back]
