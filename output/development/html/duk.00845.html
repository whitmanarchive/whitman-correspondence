   <p>Major Pond<sup><a href="#n3112" id="r1">1</a></sup> has written to me fixing dates for my proposed Boston (including I believe
      Hartford &amp; New Haven) lecturing tour<sup><a href="#duk.00845_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—but I am
      a little fearful, &amp; have not answered &amp; closed with him. I go out driving
      every day. Have just sent a poem to the <em>Nineteenth
         Century</em>.<sup><a href="#duk.00845_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> Love to you all.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Kennedy, Burroughs, and Bucke were
      three of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Kennedy (1850–1929) first
      met Whitman while on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> in 1880, and would go on to write a book-length study of the
      poet. Burroughs (1837–1921), a naturalist, met Whitman in Washington, D.C.
      in 1864 and became one of Whitman's most frequent correspondents. He would also
      go on to write several studies of Whitman. Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian
      physician, was Whitman's first biographer, and would later become one of his
      medical advisors and literary executors.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3112">1. James Burton Pond (1838–1903)
      was a famous lecture-manager and printer. He was also awarded the Medal of Honor
      for his services in the Civil War. In his 1900 autobiography <em>Eccentricities of Genius</em> (G. W. Dillingham Co: New York), he writes
      about Whitman: "Walt Whitman gave a few readings under my management during his
      life. They were mostly testimonials from friends, and benefits given in the
      theatres of New York City"; he concludes with an anecdote about the poet's
      meeting with Sir Edwin Arnold (p. 497–501).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00845_n1">2. On , Pond proposed to Whitman a reading
      in Boston on May 10.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00845_n2">3. On May 2, Whitman sent
      "November Boughs" (a gathering of four poems) to James Knowles, editor of <em>Nineteenth Century</em>, and asked £22 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Knowles returned the
      poems on . Thereupon Whitman sent them on
      May 31 to William Walsh of <em>Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</em>,
      where they appeared in November. Whitman was paid $50 (Commonplace Book).<a href="#r3">[back]
