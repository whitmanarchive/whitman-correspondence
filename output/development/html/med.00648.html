   <p>I am compelled to go out to Brookline and wonder whether you could not come around
      here and see me tomorrow (Thursday) forenoon, say before ten—9½ would
      suit me—I hope you can—should like well to have you.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00648_n1">1. Lewis T. and Percy Ives
      were father and son, both artists. In a notation late in 1880 Whitman referred
      to Percy, "age 16, a student, intends to be an artist . . . Academy of Fine
      Arts" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On
      December 21, 1881, Percy made several pencil sketches of Whitman, and in his
      letter to his grandmother, Elisa S. Leggett, on December 25, he drew a sketch
      for her of the picture which was "in a promising condition" (Detroit Public
      Library). His oil painting of Whitman is now in the Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection. See also Mrs. Leggett's letter to Whitman on .<a href="#r1">[back]
