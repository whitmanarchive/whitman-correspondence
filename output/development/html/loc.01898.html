   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0499">1. James S. Redfield, a publisher at 140 Fulton
      Street, New York, was a distributor of Whitman's books in the early 1870s.
      On March 23, 1872, Redfield accepted 496 copies of <em>Leaves
         of Grass</em>: "I am to account to him (for all that I may sell) at the
      rate of One Dollar &amp; Fifty Cents a copy, (1.50)" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection).<br><br>
      When Whitman prepared his will on October 23, 1872, he noted that Redfield
      had 500 copies of the fifth edition of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>, 400 copies of <em>As a Strong Bird on Pinions
         Free</em>, and 500 copies of <em>Democratic Vistas</em>
      (Trent Collection, Duke University). Redfield later established a London
      outlet for <em>Democratic Vistas</em> and <em>Leaves of Grass</em> with Sampson, Low, Marston, Low, and Searle, who,
      on , transferred Redfield's
      account for the remaining books to Whitman. On , when his firm was in bankruptcy, Redfield
      noted that the balance due Walt Whitman ($63.45) "will have to go in with my
      general indebtedness. I think my estate will pay 50 cents on the dollar:
      hope so at any rate." He suggested that Michael Doolady (bookseller and
      publisher who printed Ada Clare's 1866 book <em>Only a Woman's
         Heart</em>; mentioned in Whitman's , letter to Dionysius Thomas and Whitman's , letter to Doolady) and the
      new Boston firm of Estes &amp; Lauriat might agree to handle his books. He
      noted, however, that most book dealers were unwilling to sell Whitman's
      books, either because of inadequate sales or because of the poet's
      reputation in respectable circles: "It is only here and there a speckled
      sheep, like J. S. R., turns up who—not to put too fine a point upon it—don't
      care a d--n for Mrs Grundy, who would take you in."<a href="#r1">[back]
