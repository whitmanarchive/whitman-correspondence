      as Book Keeper or Clerk in the Paymaster department or some other good place if you

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Justus F. Boyd was a
      soldier in the 6th Michigan Cavalry. Whitman wrote the following entry on Boyd
      in a notebook that he kept shortly after his appointment to the Christian
      Commission, January 20, 1863 ("Walt Whitman Soldier's," Thomas Biggs Harned
      Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #99, sheets
      1098–1133): "Corp. Justus F. Boyd bed 22 co. D 6th Michigan cavalry been

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00171_n2">1. For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
      John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp;
      Eldridge in 1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an
      intelligent man who deserved something better than the various governmental
      clerical posts he was to hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship,
      however, was relieved by the presence of Whitman whom he was to love and
      venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
      vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
      pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
      important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
      those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
      O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
      sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
      first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910] pp. 513). For more
