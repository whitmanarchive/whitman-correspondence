   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pml.00052_n4">1. This letter is addressed:
      Mrs: Anne Gilchrist | Keats' Corner 12 Well Road | Hampstead | London England.
      It is postmarked: Camden | Oct | 8 | 6 PM | N.J.; Philadelphia | Oct | 8 | 1882
      | Pa.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00052_n1">2. See the first sentence of
      <em>The Divinity School Address</em> (1838): "In this
      refulgent summer, it has been a luxury to draw the breath of life."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00052_n2">3. Whitman sent two copies
      to Anne Gilchrist on October 5 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). Herbert referred to the book on October (?) 20, and Anne
      Gilchrist described her reactions to the work on .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00052_n3">4. Because the records of
      David McKay, successor to Rees Welsh &amp; Co. as Whitman's publisher, are now
      in the University of Pennsylvania Library, exact figures on sales are available
      until the poet's death. As of December 1, 1882, 4,900 copies of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> had been printed, of which 3,118 were
      sold. Whitman's royalty was $1,091.30. Only 1,000 copies of <em>Specimen Days</em> were printed and 925 copies sold; the return to Whitman
      was $203.50—a total of $1,294.80. Because Whitman owed McKay money, the
      actual return was $1,230.78 (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r4">[back]
