      <br></br><br></br>Dear sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of the 25th came duly. I
      hope there will be an effort made by the editors to push C. F. S. to the extremety
      of the law.
   </p>
   
   <p>That he obtained your goods &amp; [illegible] under <u>false</u>
      <u>pretenses</u> is perfectly certain to any [illegible]. I had placed confidence in Him
      notwithstanding warnings from some friends who didn't like his looks &amp; even up
      to last Nov. or Dec. I put confidence in him &amp; did every possible thing to help
      him. In one of those months for example (I can't remember to a day) I offered to pay
      at least $100 in payment of <u>your</u> claim in cash if he would
      let me have some property which he had no earthly use for viz some books which had
      once been in my private library a $150 bookcase which had been in my library 
       5 or 6 years before I
      thought of going into book business. He had much more &amp; [illegible] than he could use without it. In fact had some lying away
      entirely unused—I urged that it was his interest to pay you entire &amp;
      secure your new book there [illegible], &amp;c &amp;c To make a long story short I used every
      inducement to make him pay the debts but he either shuffled, evaded or refused to
      do
      any thing. I got one of the claims under his solemn promise to give me $25 towards
      it on a certain day in [illegible]. He utterly refused
      to let me have any money on even books which were [illegible] under exemption laws that I elected to call them to. Since
      then I have not spoken to him on [illegible]. One of
      the creditors is now prosecuting him <u>&amp;</u> paying lawyers
      fees. His defense is a lie.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I wish I could see you to give you all the points. However owing to a [illegible] of the contract you have an
      advantage over the other creditors. In one place he binds himself to pay you
      $200.00 (just what was due
      Dec 1st '74) In another place
      he binds himself to carry out all my contracts with you among other authors &amp;c.
      This last is quite unconditional
      . The first with
      other debts were to be paid in [
      <span class="unclear">four 
         perportions
         
         ?</span>]
       as the goods were sold. Now do you know some able lawyer
      here in whom you have confidence who would make fees in accordance with the times
      &amp; my (&amp; your) purposes? If so let me see him give him the points &amp; pay
      enough to begin operations. I will work, as I have done for 3 or 4 years, day &amp;
      might &amp; sunday, to get justice out of this 
       fellow for myself
      &amp; my editors. Your case is in the best shape of any of them &amp; it is an
      outrage that you should not have been paid promptly <u>as he most
         solemnly &amp; repeatedly promised me</u> you should be. He represented that he
      had <u>several</u> sources from which to obtain money each of
      which was quite beyond any contingency—(if you have no better acquaintance
      here) perhaps the attorney of the suit ([
      <span class="unclear">Donely?</span>]
       &amp; [illegible])
      [illegible] above would do. I never knew him till
      5 or 6 weeks since but am very well impressed. He is a man of some note, about your
      age &amp; quite moderate so far in his charges. Perhaps you can otherwise learn of
      his reliability. The name is H. F. Pultry, 67 William's 
      st
      
       However select any fair man &amp; I'll pay the gelt to test the thing
      whether he can be made to pay up if it is not too much—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I have been too hard at work in hoping to pay other debts &amp; support my large
      family to attend to this before. Now I wish to go into the book business again &amp;
      I wish to get through with C. F. S. &amp; all the debts he left unpaid. If I can do
      this without [illegible] I'll be glad—But I
      weary you—I don't wish to wait for you to come to N. Y. I want proceedings
      begun <u>at once</u>. Please let me hear promptly &amp;
      oblige
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Asa K. Butts was a New York
      bookseller. Whitman was having difficulties around this time—real or
      imaginary, as his mother might have said—with booksellers. Commenting on
      one of the letters of Butts, Whitman observed to Horace Traubel in 1889: "What a
      sweat I used to be in all the time . . . over getting my damned books published!
      When I look back at it I wonder I didn't somewhere or other on the road chuck
      the whole business into oblivion" (<em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.79.html">Friday, January 18, 1889</a>). Butts went bankrupt in 1874.
