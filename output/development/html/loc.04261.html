   <p>Thank you for the nice chicken—had some for my
      dinner—was glad to see Van &amp; to hear from you all—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am getting over my bad spell of health—but very slowly—&amp; have been
      depressed a great deal by the sudden taking down &amp; death by hasty consumption of
      a dear friend, a young man in his 19th year—I was there all Saturday and
      Sunday—till he died ab't noon—I hadn't been out of the house for three
      weeks, before—&amp; was only able to get there with assistance—he sent
      for me to be with him—The funeral was yesterday afternoon—I did not
      intend to go to the cemetery &amp; burial, but his father wished me to so earnestly,
      I went—So all these things hang like a cloud for a while—but I shall
      without doubt soon be nearly as usual—(though I think likely a little weaker
      &amp; clumsier [
      <span class="unclear">permanently?</span>]
      ).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have got to get out of this house too, &amp; very soon—for the new tenants
      take possession April 1. Don't know yet what move I shall make—but shall have
      to do something in a few days—If it hadn't been for my sick spell should have
      been out before this—I will let you know—(most likely shall come down
      &amp; tell you myself)<sup><a href="#loc.04261_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am sorry I missed Harry—I want to see him &amp; have him with me—was in
      hopes he would come up in the Friday, (or Saturday) morning train—&amp; still
      have some hopes—but I have just rec'd his postal card from Haddonfield that he
      would try to come up early next week—I send him my best love, &amp; always
      welcome<sup><a href="#loc.04261_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Susan I rec'd your good letter—If we only lived near, so I could come in &amp;
      spend a couple of hours every day or two I know it would do me good—Harry,
      come up soon—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Stafford was the father of
      Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's
      parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near
      Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. For more
      on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>" <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, eds., (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 685.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04261_n1">1. Since Whitman's young
      friend Tasker Lay was buried on Wednesday, March 12, this letter can be
      positively dated. See the letter from Whitman to Robert Pearsall Smith of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04261_n2">2. See the letter from
      Whitman to John Burroughs of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04261_n3">3. According to Harry's
      letter on , he expected to go to
      Detroit about March
      1.
      Apparently he changed his mind suddenly, for Whitman wrote in his Commonplace
      Book on March 8: "Harry S. left London, Canada—now in Detroit," but later
      interpolated after "Canada"—"for home in N.J." (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
