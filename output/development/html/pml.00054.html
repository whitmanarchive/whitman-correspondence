   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pml.00054_n2">1. This note is addressed:
      Mrs Gilchrist | Keats' Corner 12 Well Road | Hampstead | London England. It is
      postmarked: Camden | (?) | 14 | 7 AM | N.J. The note was written at the bottom
      of a post card announcement of the Philadelphia printings of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and <em>Specimen Days</em>. Since John
      Burroughs had just returned from England (see the letter from Whitman to
      Burroughs of ), and since the
      postmark is clearly "14 | AM," the card was undoubtedly written on August
      13.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00054_n1">2. Probably a reference to
      Anne Gilchrist's letter of June 18 (University of Pennsylvania).<a href="#r2">[back]
