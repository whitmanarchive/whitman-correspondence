      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman,
      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Will you please send to the enclosed address <u>two</u> copies of
      "Leaves of Grass", <u>one</u> copy of "Passage to India" and <u>one</u> copy of "Democratic Vistas". Enclosed you will find
      $7.25—$6.75 for the books and $0.50 for postage. I do not know exactly what
      this last item will be but I fancy $0.50 will be enough to pay it.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am an old reader of your works, and a great admirer of them.</p>
   
   
   
   <p>About two years ago I borrowed a copy of the 1855 edition of "Leaves of Grass" and
      I
      have a great ambition to own a copy of this edition myself; would it be possible to
      get one? Before getting that the only thing I had ever seen of yours was Rossetti's
      selection. Lately I have got a copy of the 1867 edition of "Leaves of Grass" and I
      have compared the "Walt Whitman" in that with the same poem in the 1855 edition and
      I must say I like the earlier edition best.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have an idea that I shall  be in Washington in the course of 1871 &amp; if I am it would
      give me much pleasure to see you, if you would not object, I am afraid; however,
      that, like other celebrities, you have more people call upon you than you care about
      seeing &amp; in that case I shall not wish to annoy you—At all events
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
