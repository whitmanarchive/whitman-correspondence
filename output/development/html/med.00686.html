      <br></br><br></br>Dear Jack
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I sit here—the weather is now perfect, day &amp; night—I have jotted off the enclosed
      &amp; send you—(of course use it or <em>not</em>.)<sup><a href="#sjs.00009_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Your letter arrived with the enclosures. I keep well—go out most every day. I suppose
      you rec'd the <em>Tribune</em> (27th I think) with your letter in, which I sent you<sup><a href="#sjs.00009_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—&amp; the other papers I occasionally send. No news particular—I sell a book now &amp; then—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>No, I have not been to any watering place—they are no company for me—the <em>cities</em> magnificent for their complex play &amp; oceans of eager human faces—But the country
      or sea for me in some sparse place, old barn &amp; farm house—or bleak sea shore—nobody
      round—Meanwhile I get along very well here—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="sjs.00009_n1">1. Whitman enclosed a note
      for inclusion in Burroughs's article, "Nature and the Poets," in which he
      discussed his own poetry and quoted John Addington Symonds's opinion that
      Whitman "is more thoroughly Greek than any man of modern times!" (Clara Barrus,
      <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New
      York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931], 111, also quotes Burroughs's adaptation of the
      passage). Whitman reread Symonds's <em>Greek Poets</em> while he
      was at Esopus in April (<em>Specimen Days</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall
      [New York: New York University Press, 1963], 340). Burroughs's article appeared
      in <em>Scribner's Monthly</em>, 19 (December 1879), 285–295,
      and later in <em>Pepacton</em> (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin and
      Company, 1881).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="sjs.00009_n2">2. Burroughs's "Harvest
      Time." On  Burroughs mentioned sending a
      "Pastoral Letter" to the New York <em>Tribune</em> (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell
      Kennerley, 1914], 3:260).<a href="#r2">[back]
