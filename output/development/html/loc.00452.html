      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Tis a long, long time since I have written you, and I am somewhat ashamed of it I
      assure you—but somehow I cannot seem to get time—and so day after day passes without
      writing. When I was at home I expected to be able to come to Washington to see you
      but matters turned out so—combined with Mats poor health at the time, that I could'nt make it out.
   </p>
   
   <p>You have learned, of course, through Mother of our safe arrival in St. Louis &nbsp;We at
      first put up at Barnums Hotel<sup><a href="#loc.00452_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> but the place was inconvenient and price very high so I have hired a large room (abt.
      25' X 20' by 16 high) &nbsp;we have a large stove in it, two beds and have our meals served
      from the Restaurant in the basement—the room is directly opposite the office<sup><a href="#loc.00452_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and altogether quite pleasant—yet of course we should prefer to keep house—and shall
      do so if Mattie gets well enough—I think Mat is getting better fast. Her cough is
      very much less—she is gaining in flesh and is much stronger—she goes out with me on
      the work almost every day that it is pleasant and enjoys it hugely. The children go
      to school—quite away off too—so that they take the cars that run past the door and
      within a block or so of the school. They are both very healthy and when night comes
      are just as tired as they can be what with their ride in the car—their studies and
      play &nbsp;Both of them grow fast—Hattie inde[e]d is quite a large girl.
   </p>
   
   <p>The works are going along pretty well although just at this moment we are in ill-luck
      consequent upon the river having risen and overflowed our cofferdam and thereby stopped
      progress on the river work.<sup><a href="#loc.00452_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I have just come down from there and found the water slowly falling and I hope in
      a few days—by Sunday next—to commence again—this is the part of the works that we expected would be difficult and we have got along with them better than we had
      a right to expect. For the last three weeks the river has been just on the verge of
      overflowing us—the consequence was that we worked hard to crowd the work and fight
      the water to keep it out of the dam—the foundations are from 25 to 30 feet under the
      surface of the water in the river and I felt it would make bad work to be drowned
      out &nbsp;It would (the river) go up to within just a few inches of the top of the dam
      some days and then fall a few inchs—this style of worry and excitement has had rather
      a bad effect on me as I have for some two weeks had a pretty bad diarrhea—but since
      the matter is settled I am getting better of it—and shall undoubtedly be all right
      in a few days now.
   </p>
   
   <p>I had a letter from Davis<sup><a href="#loc.00452_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> to day who is now in Brooklyn—he says he took dinner on Sunday with Mother and George—that
      they were well and that George was getting along quite fast with his Portland Avenue house &nbsp;Davis thinks of coming back to St. Louis <em>via</em> Washington—if he does you will see him and he will give you an idea of what we are
      attempting to do here—I wish, dear Walt, that you could come out and see for yourself
      tho &nbsp;'twould do us lots of good—cant you ring in on one of the R. Road examinat[ion] excursions<sup><a href="#loc.00452_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> and come as far as St Louis &nbsp;I think it would do you lots of good to come west for
      awhile just to see how big 'tis getting
   </p>
   
   <p>How goes things with you Walt? Will you be able to retain your sit under the new come
      ins?<sup><a href="#loc.00452_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Do you write anything for publications now adays.<sup><a href="#loc.00452_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> Tis so long since I have heard from you directly that I suppose you have had quite
      a good dea[l] published that I have not seen.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mattie and the children send love—when you can, scribble us a line—tis a good day
      when we get a letter from any of you &nbsp;Do you hear much about Han, &nbsp;poor girl I think
      of her often if I say but little. she has a hard lot of it.<sup><a href="#loc.00452_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> Give my love to all mutual friends in Washington—particularly the O'Connors.<sup><a href="#loc.00452_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00452_n1">1. Erected in 1854,
      Barnum's Hotel at Second and Walnut was still among the finest in St. Louis. In
      1866 Fay and McCarty purchased the hotel from the original owners, Theron Barnum
      and Josiah Fogg. Jeff had apparently broken his lease on the Olive Street house
      (see ).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00452_n2">2. This room was in the
      Hotel Garni, Billiard Hall, and Restaurant, owned by George Wolbrecht and
      located at the northeast corner of Fourth and Elm streets. Mattie described this
      room in detail to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and complained of the high
      rent—twenty dollars per month (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1977], p. 63).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00452_n3">3. On January 17 the
      Mississippi River rose twenty inches above the cofferdam that protected the
      construction site. Just before this, Jeff had been "jubilant" about the progress
      on the works (Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman, January 19, 1869 [Trent
      Collection, William R. Perkins Library, Duke University]).<a href="#r3">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00452_n6">6. Since Grant had not yet
      announced an appointee to attorney general, Walt Whitman did not know who his
      next employer would be (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer:
         A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955; rev.
      ed., New York University Press, 1967], p. 407).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00452_n7">7. Walt Whitman's essays
      "Democracy" and "Personalism" were published in the <em>Galaxy</em> in December 1867 and May 1868. The poet also planned to publish
      a third essay, "Literature," in this journal, but the piece was rejected. These
      three essays were later combined in "Democratic Vistas" (1871).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>

      became so infected that she had to have it amputated in December 1868 (Clarence
      Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp;
         Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, N.C.:
      Duke University Press, 1949], p. 225).<a href="#r8">[back]
