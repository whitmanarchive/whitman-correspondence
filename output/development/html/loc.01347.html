   <p>Your <u>third</u> letter ab't the Tennyson visit arrived today—&amp; has already been
      re-read with eager interest<sup><a href="#loc.01347_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—as was the Toynbee
      Hall one also. I now anticipate the one ab't your meeting Mrs.
      Gilchrist.—Thanks, dear girl, for the past &amp; thanks for those to
      come—Since you left we've had over three weeks of extremely hot
      weather—it affected me badly, caused some fits, unconsciousness, falling
      &amp;c—I can't go out, which is quite a cross—but no doubt in due time
      things will return to their usual routine. I am sitting here down stairs by the
      window in the little front room, writing this—Mrs. Davis has just brought me a
      beautiful perfect middling sized sun flower—it looks like a curious golden
      face turning toward me from its jar on the window sill—Fine day this for the
      Grant funeral show in New York which is going on as I write<sup><a href="#loc.01347_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—O I nearly forgot to mention the cyclone &amp;
      destruction, brief but terrible, of last Monday<sup><a href="#loc.01347_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—they did not touch these premises—but came very near.  Well, Mary, dear
      girl, I am making out a stupid letter—but I was determined to write
      something—Affectionate remembrances to Alys, the Father and Mother, Logan, and
      to Mr C<sup><a href="#loc.01347_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
