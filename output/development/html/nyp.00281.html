      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have nothing particular to write about, but I thought I would just write a line.
      I
      hope you have stood the hot weather, without giving out—&amp; George too I
      hope he exercises more care about himself, because I think our family is more liable
      than many to the effects of the great heat &amp; exposure to the sun—I have
      got along pretty well, but it has been awful hot—&amp; continues so, though
      as I write here by my window, there has quite a cool breeze sprung up since I
      commenced writing—Fortunately, I sleep very well nights—there has been
      only one night I haven't slept comfortably—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have a new Attorney General, Mr. Evarts,<sup><a href="#nyp.00281_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> as I suppose you have seen by the papers—He hasn't
      made his appearance here yet—but is expected soon—I only hope he will
      be as agreeable for a boss as the others have been—but somehow I don't
      believe he will—I am really sorry to have Binckley go, for he was a good
      friend of mine—&amp; Mr. Browning too—Mother, I do hope you will get
      through this awful spell, all right—it can't last much longer—&amp;
      George too—Mother, don't look for the next letter till <em>Wednesday next</em>—I have had a letter from Jeff<sup><a href="#nyp.00281_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—all are well &amp; hearty, except Mat has some cough
      yet—take care of yourself, dear mother.
   </p>

      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Your letter has come to-day, mother—John Burroughs has returned—he
      has a good piece in Putnam's for August—<sup><a href="#nyp.00281_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00281_n2">1. William Maxwell Evarts
      (1818–1901) was chief counsel for Andrew Johnson during the impeachment
      trial of 1868. As a reward for his services, Johnson appointed Evarts Attorney
      General later in the year; Evarts was Secretary of State from 1877 to 1881 and
      U.S. Senator from New York from 1885 to 1891.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00281_n1">2. Jeff wrote at length from
      St. Louis on : "We are all pretty
      well, all very well except Mat. She has a bad cough—and she has had it so
      long that I begin to feel quite anxious that she should be rid of it. I have had
      a doctor examine her lungs two or three times but he says they are not as yet to
      any extent affected."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00281_n3">3. Whitman refers to
      Burroughs' "A Night-Hunt in the Adirondacks," <em>Putnam's Monthly
         Magazine</em>, 12 (1868), 149–154.<a href="#r3">[back]
