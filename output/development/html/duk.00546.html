   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00546_n13">1. This letter dates to July
      1, 1868. "July 1" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard Maurice
      Bucke dated the letter to 1868. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date
      (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–75], 2:366). The year is consistent with the
      January 1868 departure of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman to St. Louis and with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman, which also
      discusses George Washington Whitman's effort to have a property surveyed.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00546_n1">2. Walt Whitman's June 29, 1868
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–75], 2:361).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00546_n8">3. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman's June 25, 1868 letter is not extant. Mattie (1836–1873) was the
      wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff
      had two daughters, Manahatta "Hattie" and Jessie Louisa "Sis." In 1868, Mattie
      and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867
      to assume the position of Superintendent of Water Works. For more on Mattie, see
      Randall H. Waldron, ed., "Introduction," <em>Mattie: The Letters
         of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      1–26.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">4. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00546_n3">5. Jeff and Mattie Whitman had
      relocated from Brooklyn to St. Louis with their daughters. Jeff moved to St.
      Louis in May 1867 to assume the position of chief engineer of the St. Louis
      Water Works, and Mattie and daughters Manahatta and Jessie Louisa joined Jeff in
      St. Louis in January 1868. Mattie had written in her March 20, 1868 letter to
      Louisa that Jeff "has so much to think about in his business that you mustnt
      think hard of him for not writing" (see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1977], 53).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00543_n2">6. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided
      in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a
      French-born landscape painter. Charles was infamous among the Whitmans for his
      offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Louisa often spoke disparagingly
      of Charles in her letters to Walt Whitman. On , she wrote, "i had a letter or package from charley hay three
      sheets of foolscap paper and a fool wrote on them."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00546_n15">7. Whether Walt visited
      Brooklyn for July 4, 1868 is not known.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00546_n14">8. The previous year Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward "Edd" Whitman had moved out of the home on 840
      Pacific Street shortly after Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's departure for St.
      Louis. Louisa and Edd had shared a home with the family of Jeff and Martha
      Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman for several years. Louisa reported the expected moving
      date as the "last of june" (see her 
      letter to Walt Whitman). She had moved to her current boarding location at 1194
      Atlantic Street.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00546_n6">9. Lewis L. Bartlett was a
      Brooklyn surveyor, with whom Jeff Whitman began his career in engineering. See
      Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.00171.html">Introduction</a>," <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of
         Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> (Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press,
      1984), 13.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00546_n10">10. Prospect Park covers over
      500 acres in what is now the center of Brooklyn. The designer for the park was
      Calvert Vaux (1824–1895), and the chief architect was Frederick Law
      Olmsted (1822[?]–1893). Work began in 1859 and continued after the
      interruption of the Civil War. In 1868, when this letter was written, the
      realization of Vaux's design was nearly complete, and the park was already quite
      popular. It stretched to the city's eastern boundary. The park is notable for
      its Long Meadow, "a classic passage of pastoral scenery with gracefully
      modulated terrain of greensward, scattered groves of trees, and indefinite
      boundaries that create a sense of unlimited space" (Charles E. Beveridge,
      "Olmsted, Frederick Law," <em>American National Biography
         Online</em>). The 840 Pacific Street home that Louisa had shared with Jeff
      Whitman and his family was on Prospect Park.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00546_n11">11. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's word, perhaps "pr[en?]ty" is probably an incomplete correction.
      The word "plenty" is likely the intended correction, but the letter "r" in
      the word originally intended, probably "pretty," is not stricken
      through.<br><br>
      George Washington Whitman a month earlier had reported Moses Lane's statement
      that Thomas Jefferson Whitman as chief engineer of the St. Louis Water Works
      was earning a salary of $6,000 per year (a figure that Louisa
      doubted—see her  letter to
      Walt Whitman). Early in his career Jeff had worked as a surveyor, but it was
      unlikely that Jeff, who had achieved such a prominent position, would have
      considered the career switch that his mother was contemplating.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00546_n12">12. The cellar was for the
      house in the lot on 1149 Atlantic Avenue. George Washington Whitman
      purchased the property outright from his partner—a man named
      Smith—and Louisa and son Edward moved there in late September (see her
       letter to Walt and Walt's
       letter to Peter
      Doyle).<br><br>
      George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until
      the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of
      Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of
      Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn
      and began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and
      later a mason named French. George eventually took up a position as
      inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on George,
      see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00546_n16">13. The conclusion of the
      phrase is written in the upper right margin. Whether Walt Whitman made a short
      visit to Brooklyn in early July for the holiday is not known, but it is unlikely
      that he visited in early July because Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in her  letter wrote that "we have all lived
      through the 4th." In any case, Walt did not take his usual extended leave of
      absence in 1868 until the autumn (see his  letter to Louisa).<a href="#r13">[back]
