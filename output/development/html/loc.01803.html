      <br></br><br></br>My dear Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>First—how are you getting on? Second (like a woman's postscript) have I told you at
      any time that I have been &amp; am preparing a vol: of Ameri: poetry, [
      <span class="unclear">up to</span>]
       your Centennial, for <u>English</u> publication? I would like, if I may, to use as fronticepiece your head, which will
      not hurt your fame on the other side; &amp; 3000 miles off will not, I think, interfere
      with the appearance of the same head here with those new things which I want to see.
      May I use it? Say honestly yes or no, as you feel. I do
      
      
      
      
      
      <u>not</u> want to do what you might not like, whether in matter of interest or feeling. But
      I can have nothing I should like so well.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish you were here now that the storms <u>seem</u> over. We have had such a spell of bad weather as I have never before been treated
      to by U.S.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours always
      <br></br><u xmlns="">WJ Linton</u>
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   the past three mos. thinks much of my head trouble is from the sun, I am almost always
   easier as day departs
   
   
   You are entirely welcome to use the eng: as you desire. I am about as usual—not any
   worse. Feel or fancy I feel relief already as summer wanes—one of my doctors

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William J. Linton
      (1812–1897), a British-born wood engraver, came to the United States in
      1866 and settled near New Haven, Connecticut. He illustrated the works of John
      Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, and
      others, wrote the "indispensable" <em>History of Wood-Engraving in
         America</em> (1882), and edited <em>Poetry of America,
         1776–1876</em> (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Whitman's
      poems as well as a frontispiece engraving of the poet. According to his <em>Threescore and Ten Years, 1820 to
         1890—Recollections</em> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Whitman
      in Washington and later visited him in Camden (which Whitman reported in his
      , letter to Peter Doyle): "I
      liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, . . . a true poet
      who could not write poetry, much of 
      wilfulness
      
       accounting for his neglect of form."
