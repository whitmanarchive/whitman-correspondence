      <br></br><br></br>Dear Nelly,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of yesterday came this morning. Yours of 5th came safe—Sunday night late,
      
      (on returning from spending the evening, so you see I gad about <em>some</em>—)<sup><a href="#nyp.00327_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I found it waiting for me, &amp; read it all through. Both letters are welcome. 
      Thank you particularly for the slip from the <em>Nation</em>,<sup><a href="#nyp.00327_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> which I had not seen nor heard of. Nelly, I looked some five or six weeks ago 
      for Mrs. Banfield's letter—&amp; now day before yesterday a second hunt—but cannot find
      it, 
      &amp; fear it has been destroyed or lost—I am distressed that I cannot find &amp; return it,
      
      as I know you think so much of your friend's letters—(Besides moving in this house
      
      from the former one—I have twice hurriedly destroyed a large mass of letters 
      &amp; MSS.—to be ready for what might happen)<sup><a href="#nyp.00327_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am indeed interested in what you write about Mrs. Huntington<sup><a href="#nyp.00327_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—it does not surprise me that she meets emergencies, &amp;c. so splendidly &amp; expands 
      to greater womanly beauty &amp; development—I always thought it in her to do so—Nelly,
      when you next see her give her my love—I return Willie's<sup><a href="#nyp.00327_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> picture—dear child—it has pleased me much—I held it a long time in my hand &amp; thought
      of H street—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nelly, I think very highly everyway of little Harold's picture—it is, to begin with,
      one of the best photos ever taken, &amp; it seems so beautiful, 
      &amp; a real <em>man-child</em>—I liked it much, &amp; have always kept it where I could see it. 
      (Nelly, did you wish me to return it? I have overlooked—or forgotten—any request to
      that effect in the letter sending it)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send my love to Mrs. Brownell—also to Garry Howard<sup><a href="#nyp.00327_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> when you see her—(what you say of her in your letter I fully endorse as my mature
      conviction—she is a good, tender girl—true as steel.) Nelly dear, I am guiltless of
      the cologne present—(don't know any thing about Peter Doyle, in this case)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear Nelly, I feel that you are—or have been—under the depressing influences of 
      Mr Dilles's<sup><a href="#nyp.00327_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> and Mr. Townsend's<sup><a href="#nyp.00327_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> deaths—If it were eligible you should come frequently &amp; spend the days with <em>me</em>, to cheer you up—meantime take early opportunities to get a change of scene of surroundings—&amp;
      often—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is very fine here, to-day—I have been hobbling out—plenty of snow on the 
      ground—but air, sun &amp; sky delightful—
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>nearly 5—It is near sundown, very fine, &amp; I am going out—as I like to be on the river,
      
      (on those strong boats crashing through the ice now plentiful on the Delaware)—I shall
      probably cross to Phil—&amp; mail this letter thence.
      
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00327_n1">1. This letter is endorsed,
      "Ans'd." Its envelope bears the address, "Mrs. E. M. O'Connor, | 1015 O
      st—near 11th N. W. | Washington, | D.C." It is postmarked: "Philadelphia |
      Feb | 11 | 11 PM | Pa."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00327_n2">2. Whitman visited the
      Johnstons on Sunday; for John and Rebecca Johnston, see Whitman's  letter. Once again Whitman's life
      fell into a pattern; in Washington he had visited the O'Connors on
      Sunday.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00327_n3">3. In a review of Joaquin
      Miller's <em>Songs of the Sunlands</em> in <em>The
         Nation</em> on January 29, 1874, an anonymous writer sharply criticized
      Whitman's catalogs, mystic raptures, and lack of restraint. On , Whitman sent a manuscript entitled "Is Walt
      Whitman's Poetry Poetical?" to John Burroughs, who was to send it to the editor
      of the magazine. If Burroughs submitted the essay, it was not published. It is
      reprinted by Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1931),
      107–110.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00327_n4">4. Whitman's statement
      explains why letters from Charles Eldridge, Peter Doyle, Ellen O'Connor, and
      others are not extant.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00327_n5">5. Whitman perhaps refers
      here to the widow of William S. Huntington (whose death was reported in
      Whitman's  letter to Peter Doyle),
      or the widow of Joshua, a clerk in the Third Auditor's office.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00327_n6">6. Whitman probably refers
      here to Huntington's son.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00327_n7">7. Whitman refers here to
      Garaphelia Howard, mentioned in Whitman's  letter to William O'Connor and in Whitman's  letter to Ellen O'Connor.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00327_n8">8. Whitman refers here to
      Israel Dille, clerk in the Internal Revenue Bureau, whose death was mentioned in
      Whitman's  letter to Ellen M.
      O'Connor.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00327_n9">9. 
      Henry Townsend, an employee in the First Auditor's office, died on February
      7, 1874; he lived at 1013 O Street, next door to Ellen O'Connor.<br><br>
      The allusion to Townsend's death establishes the year.<a href="#r9">[back]
