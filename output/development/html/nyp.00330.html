      <br></br><br></br>Dear Nelly,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I must first tell you what will please you best, namely that I [am] feeling <em>decidedly better 
         than usual</em> this morning—I have spent an hour in the bath room, (quite my regular test,) 
      &amp; come out not only without any diminution of strength or elasticity—but an increase—&amp;
      with a visit or descending upon me like of a long-absent feeling of physical ease
      
      &amp; <em>unconsciousness</em>, which I will welcome as a precursor, even if [it] soon passes over 
      (as it doubtless will)—but hope for return. For I suppose you know that my condition
      
      is very tantalizing in its fluctuations—Like today as I write—<em>now</em> the sun is out bright enough—&amp; fifteen minutes since, I noticed from the window quite
      a flurry of snow—&amp; cloudy—At any rate I am feeling again to-day one of the glimpses
      I had or was beginning to have 
      last May, before mother died—am under its influence &amp; benefit to-day—&amp; you shall have
      the good of it, Nelly dear—as far as this note can give.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Poor, poor, Ada Clare—I have been inexpressibly shocked by the horrible &amp; sudden close
      
      of her gay, easy, sunny free, loose, but <em>not ungood</em> life—I suppose you have seen about it, 
      but I cut the enclosed from the <em>Herald</em> in case you have not<sup><a href="#nyp.00330_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nelly, I rec'd your letter—I send <em>W. Graphics</em> of 21st &amp; 28th as you request—The W. G. of 7th March is my last no.<sup><a href="#nyp.00330_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—did you get it?—I rec'd Charley's letter—Love to you &amp; all—I feel to-day as though we shall yet be together
      again &amp; have better times than ever, Nelly dear.
      
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00330_n1">1. For dating this
      letter, the reference to Ada Clare is conclusive. March 8 was on Sunday in
      1874.<br><br>This letter is endorsed, "Ans'd." The letter's envelope bears
      the address, "Mrs. E. M. O'Connor, 1015 O street, near 11th N. W. |
      Washington, | D. C." It is postmarked: "Camden | (?) | 8 | N.J<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00330_n2">2. The clipping from the
      March 6, 1874 issue of the <em>New York Herald</em> is with the
      letter. Headed "A Sad Case of Hydrophobia," it recorded the death of the actress
      and author, Ada Clare (cited in Whitman's  letter to William D. O'Connor), now Mrs. Ada Noyes, on March 4,
      1874, as a result of a rabies infection she had developed five weeks
      earlier.<a href="#r2">[back]
