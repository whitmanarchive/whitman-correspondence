      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of 2d just rec'd (the one from Scotland came also)<sup><a href="#upa.00189_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I am pretty well—full as well as when I last saw you in New York—(if any thing perhaps
      a little plus)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I went down last month to spend a while with the Staffords at their new farm, but
      I miss'd my main attraction &amp; comfort, <em>the Creek</em>, &amp; did not make a long visit<sup><a href="#upa.00189_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Mrs S and the rest are as usual, except Debbie, who was not at all hearty—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Brother &amp; sister here well—sister seems to be engaged this morning with her new girl,
      (who seems to be doing marvellous!) in early fall house cleaning—at any rate I noticed
      every thing tumbled &amp; heaped just now, as I have been down stairs to see what the
      post man left me—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am sitting up in my room Stevens Street writing this—copious rains all the morning,
      and last night—(&amp; indeed this is the third day of them)—Hattie and Jessie left for
      St Louis last Thursday night—Lou and I went over to the West Phil: depot and saw them off—(dear girls, how we miss them)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am busy a little leisurely writing—think of printing soon a smallish 100 page book
      of my accumulated memoranda down at the Creek, &amp; across the Ferry, days &amp; nights,
      under the title of
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>Idle Days &amp; Nights of a half-Paralytic</em></p>
   
   
   <p>prose, free gossip mostly, (you saw some specimens in that Jersey letter, last winter
      in the Phila: <em>Times</em>)<sup><a href="#upa.00189_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Isn't that sad about the sudden death of our young Mr Sartoris in your country? Something
      strange too (I hope nothing uncanny will turn out)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thank you, dear friend, for your letter—(came in just right)—how I should indeed like
      to see that <em>Cathedral</em>—I dont know which I should go for first, the Cathedral, or <em>that baby</em><sup><a href="#upa.00189_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Best love to you—to Bee, Herb, Giddy and all—I write in haste but I am determined
      you shall have a word at least promptly in response—
   </p>

      paralytic'...for health and vigour, dear Friend, are and ever must remain
      synonymous with our Walts name" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
