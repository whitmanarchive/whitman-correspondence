   <p>I am well—have had a very fair summer, (though so much hot weather)—</p>
   
   <p>I commenced publishing L of G in June on my own hook, but found it vexatious from
      the
      start,<sup><a href="#sjs.00017_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; having quite vehement proposals from
      Rees Welsh, (2d hand book dealer &amp; law book publisher) 23 South 9th St. 
      Phila.
      
       I
      
      pass'd
      
       the use of the plates into his hands—he printed it (the plates are here
      in 
      Phila) an exact copy of the Osgood edition—Welsh's first edition (a
      cautious 1000) was ready 
      ab't
      
       three weeks ago &amp; was exhausted in a day—the
      second came in 
      ab't
      
       five days ago, &amp; is now nearly gone—a third is
      ordered—I am glad I let him have it—

   <p>I am throwing together a <em>prose</em> jumble, <em>Specimen Days</em>—(see slips enclosed)—nearly 200 pages already
      cast—O'Connor sent me a copy of your letter about visiting W M Rossetti<sup><a href="#sjs.00017_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—(O'C &amp; I correspond now quite often, &amp;
      just on the same terms as of yore)<sup><a href="#sjs.00017_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—When you have a
      leisure hour reel me off a letter—put in

       Mrs Gilchrist and
      Herbert—Dr Bucke is keeping back his book till <em>Specimen
         Days</em> comes out<sup><a href="#sjs.00017_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—will come out by winter

      returned from a two-month visit to England, as he informed Whitman in a post
      card on .<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="sjs.00017_n2">2. Before Rees Welsh &amp;
      Co. became his publisher, Whitman bound some of the "sheets" which he had
      received from Osgood (see the letter from Whitman to Burroughs of ). Goldsmith estimated that only
      fifty copies of this "edition" were issued (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York: Houghton
      Mifflin, 1931], 210n).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00017_n3">3. Late in June, apparently,
      Burroughs informed O'Connor that Rossetti now called <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> "nasty"; see O'Connor's letter to Burroughs on July 12 (Barrus,
      220). On  O'Connor wrote to Whitman of
      Rossetti's recantation: "It is sad and sickening." On  Burroughs explained the situation to Whitman: "Yes, I was
      much put out with Wm Rossetti; it was not so much what he said about your poems,
      . . . but his manner, his coldness, his indifference. He did not even ask about
      your health, or any other human thing, &amp; made me feel that my call upon him,
      miserable petrefied cockney that he is, was an unwelcome interruption."
      Apparently Rossetti and Burroughs, in Whitman's words, "did not seem altogether
      to hit it" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906], 1:437). When Rossetti wrote to Whitman on , his praise of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and <em>Specimen Days</em> was unstinted
      (Traubel, 1:436–437).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="sjs.00017_n4">4. This is Whitman's only
      reference to his estrangement from O'Connor.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00017_n5">5. According to Bucke's
      letter to O'Connor on October 14, he was withholding his book at Whitman's
      suggestion. In fact, although he carefully refrained from saying so, Bucke was
      not happy about Whitman's vague plans for the publication of his study by Rees
      Welsh &amp; Co.<a href="#r5">[back]
