   </p>
   
   <p>In answer to your letter &amp; request a few days ago <em>Yes</em> I will gladly write for the
      <em>Century</em> an article on the Hospitals &amp; Hospital Nursing of the Secession War,
      such as outlined by you—I will set about it immediately—
   </p>
   
   <p>I enclose a short sketch &amp; reminiscence of Father Taylor, with authentic
      portrait, (given me by his daughter). The price is $50—If you use it I would
      want to see proof, &amp; would like to reserve the right of printing it in future
      book—Say after the lapse of a year—Respects to Watson
      Gilder<sup><a href="#duk.00798_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Robert Underwood Johnson
      (1853–1937) was on the staff of <em>The Century
         Magazine</em> from 1873 to 1913, and was U. S. ambassador to Italy in 1920
      and 1921. Whitman included in this letter a news release based on an interview
      printed in the St. Louis <em>Post-Dispatch</em> on October 17, in
      which he criticized Bryant, Whittier, and Longfellow (reprinted in <em>American Literature</em>, 14 [1942–1943],
      144–147). See also Johnson, <em>Remembered Yesterdays</em>
      (Boston: Little, Brown, 1923), 336, and <em>Specimen Days</em>,
