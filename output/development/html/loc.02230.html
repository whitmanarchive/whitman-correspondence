   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sir Edmund William Gosse (1849–1928), English
      poet and author of <em>Father and Son</em> (a memoir published in
      1907), had written to Whitman on : "I can but thank you for all that I have learned from you, all the
      beauty you have taught me to see in the common life of healthy men and women,
      and all the pleasure there is in the mere humanity of other people" (see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.65.html">Friday, June 1, 1888</a>). Gosse reviewed <em>Two
         Rivulets</em> in "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/rivulets/anc.00075.html">Walt Whitman's New Book</a>," <em>The Academy</em>, 9 (24
      June 1876), 602–603, and visited Whitman in 1885 (see Whitman's letter
      inviting Gosse to visit on  and
      <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–1977], 3:384 n80). In a letter to
      Richard Maurice Bucke on , Whitman
      characterized Gosse as "one of the amiable conventional wall-flowers of
      literature" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). For more about Gosse, see Jerry F.
      King, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_112.html">Gosse, Sir Edmund (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02230_n1">1. On  Gosse asked permission to call on
      Whitman to deliver "to you in person the messages which I bring from Mr.
      Swinburne and other common friends in England." Although Whitman vaguely
      recorded the visit as on January "7th or before" in his Commonplace Book, Gosse
      called on Saturday morning, January 3. The Philadelphia <em>Daily
         News</em> of January 6 reported the visit in detail, with additions supplied
      by Whitman. Gosse informed the poet that recently Tennyson had "delighted a
      considerable audience with recitations for half an hour from 'Whitman's Leaves
      of Grass.'" Gosse described the visit in <em>Critical
         Kit-Kats</em> (1896), 95–111.<a href="#r1">[back]
