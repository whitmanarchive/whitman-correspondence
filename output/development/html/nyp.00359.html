      This postcard bears the address, "Pete Doyle, | M st South, bet 4½ &amp; 6th
      | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Feb | 12 | N.J.; Carrier |
      13 | Feb | (?) AM."<br><br>
      The four brief postcards to Doyle in February 1875 were written on Fridays,
      and the discussion of his ailments is confirmed in Whitman's  letter to John and Ursula
      Burroughs, which can be positively assigned to this year. Obviously this
      postcard was written before Whitman's visit to Washington in November
      1875.<a href="#r1">[back]
