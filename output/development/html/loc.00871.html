      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I send to you by the same mail which takes this note, a copy of my last poem The Picture
      of St. John. I do not know whether the subject of the poem (the growth and development
      of the artist-nature, and its relation to life) will much interest you, but I hope
      you
      will here and there find something drawn immediately from nature. I am, at least,
      not
      aware that anything in the book is simulated or forced: whether successful or not,
      it is
      an honest conscientious effort.
   </p>
   
   <p>I value, above all things, sincerity in literature; hence I amnot one of those who overlook your remarkable
      powers of expression, your broad, vital reverence for humanity, because some things
      you
      have said repel them. The age is over-squeamish, and, for my part, I prefer the honest
      nude to the suggestive half-draped. I think the proper question to be asked is: does
      a
      certain thing need to be said? If so, let it be said! The worst form of immorality,
      I
      have found, veils itself in decent words.
   </p>
   
   <p>There is one quality I recognize in you, which warmly and constantly attracts me.
      That
      is, your deep and tender reverence for Man—your 
      
      unwearied
      , affectionate, practical fraternity. There is too little of this quality in
      the world, and the race will be better and happier in proportion as it is
      manifested.
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall be in Washington on the 27th of December, to lecture, and hope that I shall
      then
      be able to meet you personally. If you can spare me an hour or two after the lecture,
      you will greatly oblige
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Bayard Taylor (1825–1878),
      translator of Goethe's <em>Faust</em>, journalist, and traveler,
      sent his "Picture of St. John" to Whitman on . He commended Whitman's "remarkable powers of expression" and
      "deep and tender reverence for Man." His letter of  was even more unreserved in its praise. Later
      Taylor's response to Whitman was to change dramatically. In <em>The Echo Club</em> (2d ed., 1876), 154–158, 168–169, Taylor
      burlesqued Whitman's poetry. William Sloane Kennedy lists him among Whitman's
      "Bitter and Relentless Foes and Villifiers"; see <em>The Fight of
         a Book for the World</em> (West Yarmouth, MA: The Stonecroft Press, 1926),
      288. See also the letter from Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman of .
