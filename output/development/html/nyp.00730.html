   <p>Y'r good letter with the £5 has reached me<sup><a href="#nyp.00730_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>, &amp; I
      have sent off to-day the books &amp; pictures by the International Express (Adams's)
      address'd the same as this letter, (as the package was too big for mail)—Send
      me word when it reaches you in good order<sup><a href="#nyp.00730_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—also
      what the expressage freight charge was—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am feeling pretty well at present, but have had a bad winter—have had <em>the grip</em> &amp; a second attack—was out yesterday four
      or five miles, to the bay shore &amp; linger'd some time by the water side—eat
      &amp; sleep middling well—in good spirits—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> is here temporarily—is well—shall probably
      get out this fine afternoon in wheel-chair—have kind attention—I send
      you my last piece—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Henry "Harry" Buxton
      Forman (1842–1917) was a British man-of-letters, an editor of and
      authority on the works of Keats and Shelley, and, starting in 1887, a
      conspirator in literary forgeries that were exposed after his death. The
      correspondence at this time between Bucke and Forman makes it clear that Bucke
      was also building up Forman's collection of Whitman (D. B. Weldon Library,
      University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00730_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      H Buxton Forman | 46 Marlborough Hill | St John's wood | London n w | England.
      It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | May 22 | 6 PM | 90; London N.W. | Z A | Ju 2 |
      90.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00730_n2">2. This letter is not
      extant.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00730_n3">3. Forman acknowledges receipt
      of this package in his  letter to Whitman.
      This acknowledgement is dated incorrectly as June 16 in Miller. The  letter acknowledges receipt of an inscribed
      copy of <em>November Boughs</em> only, which is inconsistent with
      Whitman's reference to "books &amp; pictures" in this letter.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
