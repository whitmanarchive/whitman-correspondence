      <br></br><br></br>Dear Nelly,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will just write you a line to let you know I am here in Brooklyn, &amp; well &amp;
      hearty. Mother is well as usual, &amp; sends love to you &amp; William, &amp; to
      Jeannie. My sister Martha at St. Louis was not in good health at last accounts.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Helen Price was here &amp; spent part of the day—She is looking
      finely—they are all as usual—it <em>was</em> John
      Arnold<sup><a href="#nyp.00298_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> that died—he was a complete
      wreck—death was a boon &amp; relief in the case—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have heard from Mrs. Howells<sup><a href="#nyp.00298_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I have seen Beulah,<sup><a href="#nyp.00298_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> she is a fine young woman, a handsome
      healthy blonde—she is at the fine establishment of Wilcox &amp; Gibbs,<sup><a href="#nyp.00298_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> on Broadway—her sister Lou is married—I shall soon see Mrs.
      Howells, &amp; then I will tell you further—Beulah asked much about you &amp;
      William, and Jeannie—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing special with me or my affairs. As it turns out, my death by railroad smash
      permeated the lower orders, (I suppose at second &amp; third hand) &amp; the <em>rectification</em> in many cases never reached them. So I hardly
      stir out in New York, but what I am called upon to certify, &amp;c.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am daily on the water here—it is inspiriting, &amp; surpassingly
      beautiful—Every fine day the bay swarms with yachts, large &amp;
      small—they are literally in scores—I never tire of looking on
      them—All the young fellows yacht here—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear William, how are you? and dear Charles Eldridge, how are you? My true love to
      you both—Jeannie, my darling, a kiss for you—good bye, Nelly
      dear—
   </p>
