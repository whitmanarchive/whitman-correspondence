   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Swinton (1829–1901), a journalist and
      friend of Karl Marx, became acquainted with Whitman during the Civil War.
      Swinton, managing editor of the <em>New York Times</em>,
      frequented Pfaff's, where he probably met Whitman. Whitman's correspondence with
      Swinton began on . Swinton's
      enthusiasm for Whitman was unbounded. On , Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly impressed with the great
      humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you. I read this afternoon in
      the book. I read its first division which I never before read. I could convey no
      idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more to me than all other books and
      poetry." On , Swinton wrote what
      the poet termed "almost like a love letter": "It was perhaps the very day of the
      publication of the first edition of the 'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of
      it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street, Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it
      with wonder, and felt that here was something that touched on depths of my
      humanity. Since then you have grown before me, grown around me, and grown into
      me" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.13.html">Tuesday, April 10, 1888</a>). He praised Whitman in the <em>New York Herald</em> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke,
      <em>Walt Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
      36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
      for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <em>New York Sun</em>, and for the next four years edited the
      weekly labor journal, <em>John Swinton's Paper</em>. When this
      publication folded, he returned to the <em>Sun</em>. See Robert
      Waters, <em>Career and Conversations of John Swinton</em>
      (Chicago: C.H. Kerr, 1902), and Meyer Berger, <em>The History of
         The New York Times, 1851–1951</em> (New York: Simon and Schuster,
      1951), 250–251. See also Donald Yannella, "Swinton, John
      (1829–1901)," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00886_n1">1. This postal card is
      addressed: Walt Whitman | Camden | New Jersey | United States of America. It is
      postmarked: Nice | 8e | 16 | Janv. | 90 | Alpes Maritimes; Camden, N.J. | Jan |
      28 | 9 A M | 1890 | Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00886_n2">2. Swinton is referring to the
      poem titled "A Christmas Greeting: From a Northern Star-Group to a Southern,
      1889-'90." Swinton has replaced Whitman's title with his paraphrasing of the
      first line, "Welcome, Brazilian brother—thy ample place is ready." Whitman
      included the poem in his late collection <em>Good-Bye My Fancy,
         1891-1892</em>, which became the second annex of the 1891-92 "Deathbed"
      edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00886_n3">3. This postal card is the
      first of three that Swinton wrote to Whitman while traveling through Europe to
      cure his "nervous prostration."<a href="#r3">[back]
