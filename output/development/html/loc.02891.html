   <p>Just a line of birthday greeting, my dearest Friend. May it find you enjoying the
      beautiful spring-time &amp; the grand sights of people &amp; products &amp; the
      music at Philadelphia notwithstanding drawbacks (but lessening drawbacks I earnestly
      hope) of health, lameness. Rejoiced, too, perhaps with the sight of many dear old
      friends whom  occasion
      has brought to your city. May all that will do you good come my dearest Friend. And
      not least the sense of relief &amp; joy in having fulfilled the great task, in the
      teeth of such difficulties re-launched safely, more fully, richly equipt the ship
      to
      sail down the great ocean of Time, bearing precious precious freight of seed to be
      planted in countless successions of human souls; helping forward more than even the
      best lovers of your 
      poems dream, the great future of humanity. That is what I believe as surely as I
      believe in my own existence.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The "low star," the great star drooping low in the west has been unusually
      resplendent of a night here lately &amp; by day lilacs &amp; the labernums
      wonderfully brightening dear old smoky London, constant reminders all, if I needed
      any, of the Poet &amp; the Poems so dear to me. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If I do not hear from you to the contrary I aim to take our passage by one of the
      "States" Line of Steamers that come straight to Philadelphia sailing about the 1st
      Sept.—&amp; I am told one ought to secure one's cabin a couple of months or so
      beforehand. But if there be indeed an increasing hope of your coming here in the
      course of the summer or if you think it would be best for us to go to New York (only
      I want to go at once where we are likely to stop, because of my  furniture) let me hear
      as soon as may be dear Friend. Looking at it purely as concerns the young ones, for
      some reasons it is very desirable to come this year &amp; for others to wait till
      next. With Bee for
      instance we are both losing time &amp; wasting money by going over another winter
      here when there is no complete &amp; satisfactory medical course to be had. Then as
      regards dear 
      Per
      
       he writes me word that though he is doing
      fairly well he does not  think he will be able to take a house &amp; marry till next summer—&amp;
      that I am very sorry for. But then I think that as I could not be with him nor help
      him forward the balance goes down on Beatrice's side, if I am able to accomplish
      it— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Good bye my dearest Friend. Loving tender thoughts shall I send you on the 3Oth. Solemn thoughts outleaping life, immortal
      aspirations of my Soul toward <u>your</u> soul. The 
      childrens
      
       love too please dearest Friend.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
