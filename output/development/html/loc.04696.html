      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thank you for the copy of <u>Once a Week</u> you sent me &amp; which I received on the 17th all.—I noted especially the account of
      the O'Gorman Mahon<sup><a href="#loc.04696_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>, &amp; the pictures &amp; leader relating to the Indians. It reminded me of your Indian Bureau
      Reminiscences, which I re-read
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I hope that your artist friend "B.H."<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r2">2</a></sup> "regained his health" &amp; has been successful in his studies &amp; work.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you herewith a copy of "<u>The Magazine of Art</u>" for January,—containing a photogravure &amp; engravings of earlier portraits of Ruskin<sup><a href="#n3013" id="r3">3</a></sup>, which I think will interest you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have long been deeply interested in his books, &amp; it used to be one of my main desires
      to give
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>them complete &amp; exhaustive study that I, too, might contribute a little to their exposition
      &amp; support.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And I still think that no English author—since his master Carlyle<sup><a href="#n4301" id="r4">4</a></sup>—so emphatically deserves it, &amp; deserves the sympathetic &amp; careful study of his race.
      And at <u>no</u> period, probably, has a braver, purer spirit ever spent his passionate force in literature
      for the sacred cause of human well-being.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>His message (with whatever limitations,—&amp; they are great) is one of deep importance
      to his generation, &amp; should be laid well to heart. But it still needs to be set in
      its due relationship &amp; needs (it seems to me) to be corrected &amp; offset by the larger
      &amp; complementary (a rather over-arching) teaching which <u>you</u> have given us. I have long desired to attempt to do this. And with better health
      &amp; strength, &amp; under
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>more favourable conditions, I yet hope to do something towards it.</p>
   
   
   <p>I often wonder to what extent you are acquainted with his books. No doubt you know
      some of them well. They are antagonistic, of course, in several essential respects,
      to your own. But I am often struck, in minor points, with the degree in which they
      are not only in unison with yours, but in which they support &amp; illustrate them.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>"Wisdom is justified of <u>all</u> her children," and the truth of every man's work or thought is eliminated, in course
      of time, to the last fraction, from the false, &amp; helps onward the march of human progress.—If
      Ruskin is narrow &amp; wilful—if he "prescribes specifics for indispensible evils," or
      if,—Quixote-like,—he tilts at times against imaginary foes, let us, not any the less,
      revere the [
      <span class="unclear">nobleness?</span>]
       of his aims, &amp;
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>&amp; honour, with swelling love &amp; gratitude, the fiery war against the evils of his time,
      in which he has spent his energies &amp; wasted his heart.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>One wishes, at times, that he had known you personally long ago, &amp; could have had
      familiar talk with you, face to face, as he had with Carlyle.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And I have often been disposed to wish that Carlyle could have done so too. Your great
      love for him is very manifest. [
      <span class="unclear">And?</span>]
       <u>he</u>, [
      <span class="unclear">above?</span>]
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>all others, loved a man &amp; knew one when he saw one.</p>
   
   
   <p>—How sad &amp; strange, it seems at times, that he should have never really known you
      at all! But the Divine Providence is wise. It was Carlyle's lot to do a great &amp; needed
      service, which, under other conditions, would perhaps have never been done. And though
      one wishes for <u>his</u> sake that he could have learned of you, &amp; though it might have saved him desolating
      pain &amp; loneliness of heart, yet,
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>who shall say that his great soul was not better for the terrible toils &amp; grim purgatorial
      fires through which he passed, &amp; for the agonizings &amp; fierce travail throes of his
      prophetic (however partial) message?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And it has seemed clear to me, in reading Ruskin's latest books, (the later vols.
      of "<u>Fors Clavigera</u>" especially) that in his passionate crusade against the evils of our modern life—notwithstanding
      its bruises to his delicate, susceptible spirit, &amp; the yet more bitter separation
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>of life &amp; isolation of soul in which it has placed him.—(as of one "crying in the
      wilderness") he has, nevertheless, gained in spiritual depth &amp; insight, &amp; (I think)
      in a deeper trust in the ultimate good to follow the vast movements &amp; (to him) apparent
      disintegration &amp; retrogression of our time.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>He does not love your Republic &amp; its aims. But no other living English author, I think,
      has made (with all deductions) so valuable a contribution to its
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>sociology &amp; evolution. (Though I recognize its limitations &amp; drawbacks.—&amp; see how
      much better is the ideal to which America is actually tending—independently of any
      authors).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pardon my writing to you thus.—But it is partly <u>because</u> I have loved Carlyle &amp; Ruskin from long years, &amp; studied their books, that <u>your</u> teaching has been so precious to me.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope that you are keeping better —The weather here is very variable—a day</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>or two of thaw—or rain—followed by sharp frost &amp; snow.</p>
   
   
   <p>With love to you always</p>
   
   <p>I remain</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n3013">3. John Ruskin (1819–1900) was
      one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
      via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
      of ). Ruskin, according to Whitman,
      expressed "<em>worry</em> [...] that [<em>Leaves</em> is] <em>too personal</em>, too emotional,
      launched from the fires of [...] spinal passions, joys, yearnings" (see the
      letter from Whitman to William O'Connor of ). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my
      Ruskin with some qualifications." Still, Ruskin "is not to be made little of: is
      of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.4.html">Thursday, January 24, 1889</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
