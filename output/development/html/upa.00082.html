   <p>Some of her most beautiful, characteristic, interesting and copious letters were written
      to her friend Walt

      letters or rather extracts from them, for publication in the present volume. But
      the poet was not entirely favorable or willing. "I do not know," he says in a
      late letter to me, "that I can furnish any good reason, but I feel to keep these
      sweet utterances exclusively to myself.
      But I cannot let your book go to press without at least saying—and wishing
      it put on record—that among the perfect women I have known (and it has
      been my unspeakably good fortune to have had the very best for mother, sisters
      and friends) I have known none more perfect in every relation than my dear, dear

   <p id="upa.00082_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Herbert H. Gilchrist | 12 Well Road | Hampstead | London | England. It is
      postmarked: London, N.W. | 7 U | Sp 3 | 86.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0199">2. Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>).

   <p id="upa.00082_n2">3. The "Circular" was a
      facsimile of Walt Whitman's letter to Rossetti (see the letter from Whitman to
      William Michael Rossetti of ).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="upa.00082_n7">4. Glendale, New Jersey, was
      where the Staffords had moved after leaving their farm at Timber Creek, where
      Whitman had often visited.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02189_n3">5. Susan and George Stafford
      were the parents of Whitman's young friend, Harry Stafford. Whitman often
      visited the family at their farm at Timber Creek in Laurel Springs (near
      Glendale), New Jersey, and was sometimes accompanied by Herbert Gilchrist; in
      the 1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby Glendale. For more,
      see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">6. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">7. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00082_n3">8. On  Herbert Gilchrist wrote: "What I wrote
      about Dr B[ucke] sings discordantly in my ears—but in truth I was and am
      angry at his cool request to hand over your letters (&amp; mothers) to him: his
      injudicious literary zeal does you and every body else harm."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00082_n4">9. This paragraph appears in
      Herbert's preface to his biography of his mother: "I do not know . . . that I
      can furnish any good reason, but I feel to keep these utterances exclusively to
      myself. But I cannot let your book go to press without at least saying—and
      wishing it put on record—that among the perfect women I have known (and it
      has been my unspeakably good fortune to have had the very best, for mother,
      sisters and friends) I have known none more perfect in every relation, than my
      dear, dear friend, Anne Gilchrist." Apparently in a lost letter Herbert had
      asked permission to include his mother's letters to the poet. See also Whitman's
      letter to Herbert Gilchrist of .
      Herbert's mother, Anne Burrows Gilchrist (1828–1885), was the author of
      one of the first significant pieces of criticism on <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by
      an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May
      1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long correspondence with Whitman indicates that
      she had fallen in love with the poet after reading his work; when the pair met
      in 1876 when she moved to Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her
      affection, although their friendship deepened after that meeting. For more
      information on their relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
