   <p>I have today the new L. of G. "31 May 1889."<sup><a href="#loc.07306_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> It is a lovely little book. I am
      thoroughly delighted with it. I have a few cuttings from eastern papers this evening
      (sent by a friend) in re dinner.<sup><a href="#loc.03027_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> Very glad to see that you were actually present and
      (more than I expected) spoke a few words.<sup><a href="#loc.07306_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I shall hope to have the papers in full
      and some short account of the affair in M.S. from you or Horace<sup><a href="#loc.07306_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>. I judge from what I
      see in the papers that the dinner was a success. I am rejoiced, dear friend, that
      you have stayed with us to get out the <u>big</u><sup><a href="#n4195" id="r5">5</a></sup> and the <u>last</u> eds. and for this dinner It will surely be patent
      to all near that you have <u>come to stay</u>—patent 
      or not to the rest it is to me an evident fact. It is wonderfull
      how much more <u>grip</u> you seem to have on the world now
      than even five years ago and the last year even has made an immense difference. Yes,
      Walt, you are undoubtedly <u>an institution</u> and if I live
      another twenty years (which is very doubtful!) I shall not be surprised to see my
      highest claims for you (for making which I have been counted a lunatic<sup><a href="#loc.07306_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup>) broadly and
      even generally allowed. My copy of Sarrazin<sup><a href="#n3115" id="r7">7</a></sup> has come to hand by the afternoon's
      mail—it is as you said, a lovely little book.<sup><a href="#loc.07306_n5" id="r8">8</a></sup> Our spell of dark, cold, rainy
      weather has let up at last and we have summer again—not very warm yet but
      getting warm—it is now 5 P.M. a charming warm, bright evening‑our lilacs
      are out and the grounds look well

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07306_n1">1. In his letter of , Whitman told Bucke that he sent a
      copy of the pocket-book edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. The
      poet had the special pocket-book edition printed in honor of his 70th
      birthday–May 31, 1889–through special arrangement with Frederick
      Oldach. See Whitman's , letter to
      Oldach. Only 300 copies were printed, and Whitman signed the title page of each
      one. The volume also included the annex <em>Sands at Seventy</em>
      and his essay <em>A Backward Glance O'er Traveled Roads</em>. For
      more information on the book see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a></em>. Bucke's copy of the 1889 pocket-book edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> is described in the Sotheby &amp; Co
      (1935) and the American Art Association (1936) auction catalogues of his Whitman
      collection. The item is numbered 11 and 294, respectively.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03027_n4">2. For Whitman's seventieth
      birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
      the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
      (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.30.html">Tuesday, May 7, 1889</a>. The day was celebrated with a testimonial
      dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
      addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
      arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07306_n2">3. Whitman's speech is
      published in <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em>
      (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1889), 5. This volume consisted of the notes and
      addresses that were delivered at Whitman's seventieth birthday celebration on
      May 31, 1889 in Camden, were collected and edited by Horace Traubel. It also
      included a photo of Sidney Morse's 1887 clay bust of Whitman as the
      frontispiece. The book was published in 1889 by Philadelphia publisher David
      McKay. Traubel provides a report of the proceedings in With
      Walt Whitman in Camden, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.54.html">Friday, May 31, 1889</a>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07306_n3">4. Whitman gave Bucke a report
      of the proceedings in his letter of , 1889.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4195">5. Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), a volume Whitman often referred to
      as the "big book," was published by Philadelphia publisher David McKay in
      December 1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, he made the presswork and
      binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the book, which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more information on
      the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07306_n4">6. Richard Watson Gilder,
      the editor of <em>The Century Illustrated Mothly Magazine</em> and
      the most distinguished guest at the birthday dinner, had referred to Bucke as
      "that Canadian crank." Although Gilder made this remark to Thomas Harned in
      private, Harned repeated it to both Whitman and Traubel. Whitman, of course,
      defended Bucke: "Bucke is no crank at all—he is simply individualistic. If
      to be individualistic is to be a crank, then he is one—not otherwise"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.59.html">Wednesday, June 5, 1889</a> and <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.55.html">Saturday, June 1, 1889</a>).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3115">7. Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935)
      was a translator and poet from France, who commented positively not only on
      Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and
      apparently liked the critic's work on <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>—Whitman even had Sarrazin's chapter on his book translated
      twice. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]

         1798-1889</em> (Paris: Perrin, 1889).<a href="#r8">[back]
