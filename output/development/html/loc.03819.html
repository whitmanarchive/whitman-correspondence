      <br></br><br></br>Dear Logan
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Nothing special to write about—yet I tho't I would send you a line—I
      suppose they are all over there in London, having good times—the baby
      included—dear baby! henceforth not the least among the objects of our
      interest—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Showery here to-day—I tho't of getting out with my horse &amp; rig for a
      drive—but this prevents—I am still tied to the house &amp; chair—a
      bad spell the last ten days—heat—but much less bad yesterday &amp;
      to-day—Mr Morse<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r1">1</a></sup> still here <u>sculping</u> me &amp; H Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> with the
      portrait—both please me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I have <u>born</u> two little poems<sup><a href="#uva.00553_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—which you will see in due
      time. It is middle of afternoon—have had five of the N Y and Phila. Sunday
      papers, reading all day—also looking out of the window—the mocking bird
      over the way is singing gay &amp; fast—God bless you Logan boy—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Logan Pearsall Smith
      (1865–1946) was an essayist and literary critic. He was the son of Robert
      Pearsall Smith, a minister and writer who befriended Whitman, and he was the
      brother of Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, one of Whitman's most avid followers.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0862">1. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.<a href="#r1">[back]
