   <p>Edward Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r2">2</a></sup> sent us on a letter he had received from

   <p>Thank you very much  for remembering Bessie &amp; me.  We never never forget
      you—nor the great great debt we owe you for all you have written. We
      shall like to have an "Autumn
      Boughs"<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r3">3</a></sup> very much—it is good of you to think of sending us
      one. I wish you were feeling better &amp; stronger.
   </p>
   
   <p>A friend of your's saw you  lately in America—&amp; wrote to us about his visit to
      you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Goodbye. Both Bessie &amp; I send you our warmest greetings for the New Year &amp;
      for all times.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Isabella Ford
      (1855–1924) was an English feminist, socialist, and writer. Elizabeth
      (Bessie) Ford was her sister. Both were introduced to Whitman's writings by
      Edward Carpenter and they quickly became admirers of the aged poet.

   <p id="n0141b">2. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
