   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00518_n11">1. Richard Maurice Bucke dated
      the letter March 6, 1868, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date
      (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:365). March 6, 1868 fell on Friday, and both
      the day of the week and the calendar date are in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      hand. Furthermore, the letter must follow the recent marriage of Colonel Elliot
      F. Shepard to Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt, a ceremony to which George Washington
      Whitman was invited, on February 18, 1868. March 6, 1868 was the first Friday to
      follow on the 6th day of the month after the Shepard-Vanderbilt wedding.
      Therefore, the letter dates to March 6, 1868.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00518_n2">3. In late 1867, George began
      inspecting gas pipes in Camden, New Jersey and Brooklyn, New York. By 1869, he
      had accepted a position inspecting pipes at a Camden foundry.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00518_n3">4. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. The
      connection between Lane and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, who had served
      under Lane before accepting the position of Chief Engineer at the St. Louis
      Water Works, led to George Washington Whitman's employment as a pipe inspector
      in Brooklyn. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in her  letter reported Jeff Whitman's confidence that George's
      connection to Lane offered assurance of stable employment. George's position
      with the Brooklyn Water Works became more tenuous in 1869 after the
      reorganization of the Brooklyn Board of Water Commissioners in April: Lane
      resigned after the new board was seated (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman). Lane later designed and
      constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city engineer, and he
      again employed George to inspect pipe in Camden, New Jersey ("Moses Lane," <em>Proceedings of the American Society of Civil Engineers</em>
      [February 1882], 58).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00477_n13">5. Abby H. Price
      (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
      husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
      children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
      age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter Helen,
      were friends with Walt Whitman and with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. In 1860 the
      Price family began to save Walt's letters. In a  letter to Ellen M. O'Connor, Whitman declared, "<em>they are all friends</em>, to prize and love deeply."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00518_n9">6. "Jenne" may have been a
      shared acquaintance of the Price family. If so, "Jenne" is unidentified, but
      Walt Whitman presumably would have recognized the person because he visited
      often with the Prices and sometimes stayed with them during trips to New York.
      But the letter here may also switch to a description of a family that lives
      upstairs in the Atlantic Street boarding house. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman spoke
      of the "chappells" in her  letter to
      Walt. According to that letter, the husband had "an awful temper," but the wife
      Janey (not "Jenne" as here) let it go "in one ear and out the other."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00518_n19">7. Colonel Elliot F. Shepard
      (1833–1893) served with George Washington Whitman and the Fifty-first New
      York during the Civil War. In April of 1862, he wrote to George, "I have the
      pleasure of handing you your commission, and congratulate you upon your
      promotion" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      [New York: Rowan and Littlefield, 1961], <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.43.html">2:201</a>). Shepard married Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt (1845–1924),
      the daughter of railroad tycoon William H. Vanderbilt, on February 18, 1868
      ("Married," <em>New York Times</em>, February 20, 1868, 5).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00518_n7">8. The letter that Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman wrote to her daughter Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde
      (1823–1908) "stirred . . . up" Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1892),
      Hannah's husband (see Louisa's 
      letter to Walt Whitman). Hannah, who resided in Burlington, Vermont, was married
      to Heyde, a French-born landscape painter. Louisa often spoke disparagingly of
      Heyde "Hay" in her letters to Walt. On , she wrote, "i had a letter or package from charley hay three
      sheets of foolscap paper and a fool wrote on them."<a href="#r8">[back]
