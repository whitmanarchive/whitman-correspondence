   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="mhs.00011_n1">1. Jeff's letter to Walt is
      not extant, but in a letter written on the same day to Mrs. Whitman, Jeff
      expressed fears for Martha's recovery, and urged that Whitman come to St. Louis
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). When he wrote, Jeff was unaware of the
      seriousness of his brother's paralysis.<a href="#r1">[back]
