      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir
      
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Yours of Jan: 31 just rec'd.<sup><a href="#prc.00105_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> No such letter of 22d, nor P.O. order has reached me—&amp; of course none has been paid
      by P.O. here.<sup><a href="#prc.00105_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I see that Jan: 6 I sent you my circular in answer to previous letter from you—that
      is the only correspondence—I have sent nothing, heard nothing, rec'd nothing since.
      But as in all such cases, I consider it my obligation &amp; loss. I send the Two Volumes,
      to you, same mail with this—The Two
      
      embody <u>all</u> my works—the little Vol's being only selections from them in duplicate.

   <p id="prc.00105_n2">2. Whitman made the following
      note in his Commonplace Book on February 2: "Sent a set Two Vols: to Frank H
      Ransom of D Ransom Son &amp; Co: Medicine Warehouse, Buffalo N Y.—He
      writes (letter rec'd to day), that he sent me a p.o. order for $12.50 on Jan:
      22—I write to-day that I have not seen or heard of any such order, but
      consider it my loss, &amp; send." Below this entry, Whitman added in blue
      pencil: "the books—rec'd—paid (12.50)" (<em>Daybooks
         and Notebooks</em>, ed. William White [New York: New York University Press,
      1977], 224).<a href="#r2">[back]
