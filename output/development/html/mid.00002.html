      <br></br><br></br>Dear Al Wise:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I should have answered your welcome note before—but better late than never.</p>
   
   <p>I remember you very well, dear boy—and though you must now be indeed quite
      different from the little child I used to lift up in my arms &amp; kiss, as I passed
      along the street, I hope we may yet call each other friends.
   </p>
   
   <p>In response to your letter I send—not my whole volume of <u>Leaves</u>
      <u>of</u>
      <u>Grass</u>–but <u>Drum</u>–<u>Taps</u>, a part of it, consisting of pieces created out of
      the war—several of them written in camp, hospital, or on the field.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>The other little volume has been published by John Burroughs, who, being a great friend of mine, views every thing relating to me &amp;
      my works from an extremely partial point of view.
   </p>
   
   <p>I send the books by same mail with this—directed same address.</p>
   
   <p>—I send you my love, &amp; I wish you to give my friendliest remembrances to
      your parents.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Probably the Alfred Wise whose father William Wise
      (1814–1903) was a jeweler for more than seventy years in Brooklyn. Alfred
      became a partner in his father's jewelry business in the 1850s, at which time
      the business was renamed William Wise &amp; Son. William and Alfred Wise are
      listed in Walt Whitman's 1866&amp;1867 notebooks as living at 233 Fulton St.,
      Brooklyn.
