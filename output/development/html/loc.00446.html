      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We all arrived safely at Pittsburgh abt 2 oclk to-day—Mattie and the children stood the journey first-rate—and Mat seems to feel
      fully as well as in Brooklyn &nbsp;I find I shall probably have to stay here longer than
      I anticipated—possibly shall not get away tomorrow but hope to—
   </p>
   
   <p>We had quite a pleasant time in coming on—Mrs Rice<sup><a href="#loc.00446_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—(with child and nurse) met us at the Depot—I succeeded in getting a state room in
      the sleeping car—and was particularly fortunate in doing so—as many were left out
      or rather had to get along without sleep
   </p>
   
   <p>I write this merely to tell you that we got through so far all right—and also to send
      you this [t?]<sup><a href="#loc.00446_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Mat has worried about my not giving it to you ever since we came away—you must thank
      her for it not me—for to tell you the truth, dear old Mamma I have so much to think
      about that I do not remember you as often as I ought to.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mattie sends love to you and all—I ditto—and the young ones likewise, will write again
      from St Louis as soon as we get there
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00446_n1">1. Jeff returned for a
      Christmas visit to Brooklyn on December 18, 1867, and by early January 1868 had
      convinced Mattie to move the entire family west. Mattie's earliest letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from St. Louis (February 1, 1868) implies that the
      family had been there for over a week (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York:
      New York Univ. Press, 1977], pp. 44-46); it therefore seems likely that Jeff
      wrote this letter en route on the third Friday of January.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00446_n2">2. Mr. and Mrs. Rice lived
      in St. Louis at this time, but they seem to have been old acquaintances of the
      Jefferson Whitmans from the East (Waldron, p. 45).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00446_n3">3. Probably a gift of ten
      dollars. For a similar present from Mattie, see .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
