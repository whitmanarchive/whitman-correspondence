      the sheriffs office and see Michael Halloran tell him all about him (Harry) &amp; ask
      him how hose 48 is. &amp; if there is any chances of getting into the Fire Department
      &nbsp;also to give my respects to all inquiring friends &amp; ask him if i can get one of the
      old Exempt Fire Badges. Dear Walt you have no idea how much interest the boys takes
      in your letters
