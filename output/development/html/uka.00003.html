      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt: 
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>A paper from you last night reminds me that it is time I again reported myself. We
      are back home again &amp; I am busy about my farm work. The spring is early, the
      robins are calling the old call about the place, the sparrows are singing the old
      songs, &amp; nature seems as fresh &amp; young as ever. My plough seems to find as much fat in
      the ribs of old mother Earth as ever it did &amp; it looks just as sweet. I am very
      glad to be back again, &amp; to get at some real work. On the 5<u>th</u> of March I went to NY. for a week; stayed with Gilder<sup><a href="#n0871" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; then with Johnson<sup><a href="#uka.00003_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>; had a
      pretty good time. Saw some of the small literary fry, dined with Gilder at the
      Fellowcraft Club of which he is president, met George Kennan<sup><a href="#n7003" id="r4">4</a></sup> of
      whom I think highly, met Mrs Custer<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; Mrs Cleveland<sup><a href="#uka.00003_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      both charming women. Charles DeKay<sup><a href="#n7002" id="r7">7</a></sup> is married &amp; is stout 
      &amp; handsome.<sup><a href="#uka.00003_n2" id="r8">8</a></sup> Gilder is very busy, goes out a good
      deal, but finds time to write some poetry still. He owns a house now in Clinton
      Place (8<u>th</u> st.) Walked down to City hall &amp; was
      astonished to see the <u>Times</u> building towering up &amp;
      quite overshadowing the <u>Tribune</u> building. Its architecture
      is fine &amp; makes the spotted &amp; clumsy character of the building of its rival
      look cheap enough.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am to have a new book this Spring, a collection of "Indoor Essays," rather a piece of book-making
      business—not much worth.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you are comfortable these spring days, &amp; can nearly get a glimpse of the
      spring. I am well, but not very cheerful for some reason. Any news from
      O'Connor,<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r9">9</a></sup> or yourself will be very welcome.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n0871">2. Richard Watson Gilder
      (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <em>The Century</em>, from 1881 until his death. Whitman had met
      Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1955], 482). Whitman attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
      Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the <em>New York Tribune</em>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder
      one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
      delirium" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">Sunday, August 5, 1888</a>). For more about Gilder, see Susan L.

   <p id="n7002">7. Charles DeKay (1848–1935) was
      a New York poet and literary and art critic. He was the brother of the artist
      Helena DeKay Gilder, wife of the editor Richard Watson Gilder, a friend and
      supporter of Whitman. DeKay contributed an article on "George Fuller, Painter"
      to the September, 1889 <em>Magazine of Art</em> that compared
      Fuller and Whitman. Whitman discussed the article with Horace Traubel; see
