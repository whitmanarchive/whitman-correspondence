      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I must of late by chance, with an extract from your writings,—with which as a
      whole I have to confess I am but little acquainted. This is the passage, "I think
      I
      could turn and live with the animals, they are so placid and
      self-contained"—and so on, ending with—"Not one is responsible or
      industrious over the whole earth."
   </p>
   
   <p>That is all there was, and it is great! I love  animals, and understand them well,
      feeling a [illegible]
      kinship to them as a rule, I have to [illegible] human [illegible] feeling too, I acknowledge more keenly [illegible] to their
      sufferings and [illegible], than to those of mankind, as being so much less desire. I have the cool
      assumption of immorality for [illegible] mainly from false to the great trusts [illegible] in them, while these  humbler ones as
      the dog, and horse, faithful unto death, unselfish and [illegible] must be cut short in a [illegible] honest and
      trues, [illegible], and
      uncomplaining.
   </p>
   
   <p>But this little note was not intended to afflict you with a [illegible] discussion of the mighty [illegible] of the [illegible] which holds us
      all, big and little its mighty leash, I want to ask you, respected sir, to point me
      to the volume 
      wherein I [
      <span class="unclear">can find?</span>]
       the
      [illegible] excerpt
      and its [illegible]
      [illegible] is what I
      desire and if you will kindly help me [illegible] I shall remain as now
   </p>
