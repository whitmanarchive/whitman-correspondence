      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is years since I received from you a precious letter in reply to some South Sea
      sketches I had sent you;<sup><a href="#n0600" id="r1">1</a></sup> and though in that letter you said you did not like to
      write letters but preferred to meet people, I venture for several reasons to address
      you once more.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>My copy of your "Leaves of Grass" <u>
         Edt-67</u> has been with me to the Sandwich Islands<sup><a href="#man.00033_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> and to Tahiti and all
      over Europe—to Egypt; up the Nile into Nubia,<sup><a href="#man.00033_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> up into Asiatic Turkey and if
      you could see its well thumbed pages you would realize how faithful a reader I have
      been. It is now
      my chief delight and I am glad to tell you so.
   </p>
   
   <p>May I ask if it will be possible for me to obtain a copy of the Original Edition—the large thin volume which,
      I am told, you helped to print? I want so much to have it. Did you set the type—or
      any
      part of it?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Have you still some copies of your complete works in <u>two 
         Vols, such as I saw in England?</u> If you have, may I send you the price
      of them and receive the set with your photographs and Autograph (your name and mine)
      from your own hands?
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Before me hangs a picture
      of you which I cut long ago from an Early Edition of your Poems. I like it above all
      others; It is the
      [
      <span class="unclear">best?</span>]
      —a
      lithograph, I
      think—with the broad collar thrown open
      and such a glow of splendid health in the face.
   </p>
   
   <p>I want so much, dear Friend, to have certain lines, which I have
      selected, in your hand writing, to frame with this picture. Am I asking too much in asking
      this? Command me in return, my friend, and see if I will not respond.
   </p>
   
   <p>These are the lines I beg of you; are they not fit?</p>
   
   <p>Will you so far indulge me as to write them on a single page and
      to post them with your name and mine also?
   </p> 
   
   <p>I beseech you do me this [
      <span class="unclear">favor?</span>]
       and fear not that I
      will trouble you more—
   </p>
   
   <p>the Autograph</p>
   
   <p>"Behold this swarthy face, this unrefined face—these gray eyes,<br>This beard—the white wool unclipt upon my neck,<br>My brown hands, and the silent manner of me, without charm.<br><br>You will hardly know who I am, or what I mean;<br>But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,<br>And filter and fibre your blood.<br>Failing to fetch me at first, keep encouraged;<br>Missing one place, search an other;<br>I stop somewhere, waiting for you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt Whitman to 
      Chrs
      
       Warren Stoddard"
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>In rereading this letter I feel that I am asking much—too much—but have
      not the heart to suppress any part of it.
   </p>
   
   <p>My friend Joaquin Miller<sup><a href="#n0412" id="r4">4</a></sup> and I have often talked of you. I desired
      much to see you when I was on my way home from the Old World—two years ago—but
      failed.
   </p>
   
   <p>Please forgive me for this intrusion and believe in any case that</p>

   <p id="n0600">1. Charles Warren Stoddard (1843–1909)
      published <em>Poems</em>, edited by Bret Harte, in 1867. His
      account of "A South-Sea Idyl," <em>Overland Monthly</em>, 3
      (September 1869), 257–264, is mentioned in Whitman's , letter to Stoddard. A journalist
      and a lecturer at the Catholic University of America from 1889 to 1902, Stoddard
      was for a brief period Mark Twain's secretary.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0412">4. Joaquin Miller was the pen name of Cincinnatus Heine
      Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of the Rockies" and
      "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <em>Westminster Review</em>
      described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness which marked Walt Whitman's
      poetry." In an entry in his journal dated August 1, 1871, John Burroughs
      recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's poetry; see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin Co., 1931), 60. Whitman met Miller for the first time later in 1872; he
      wrote of a visit with Miller in a 
      letter to Charles W. Eldridge.<a href="#r4">[back]
