      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am here at the bedside of your friend Babbitt<sup><a href="#loc.00876_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> in the Mason Hospital.  I read him your letter; and he wishes me to say to you that
      he would be glad to answer your letters to him if he was able.  He is in about the
      same condition he has been in for three months.  He wishes to go home to his friends
      in Barre, and could get his discharge, but Dr. Bliss,<sup><a href="#loc.00876_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> of the Armory Square Hospital, neglects to send on his descriptive list, although
      the surgeon here has written to him for it.  No doubt you can see to having it sent.
      Mr. Babbitt's father, who has been out with the 53rd, is going out again, and he is
      anxious to get his son home before he leaves.  The descriptive list is the only thing
      necessary now to procure his discharge.  Your friend wishes you to see Dr. Bliss,
      and write to him what he says about it.  I shall come and see him whenever I come
      to town.  What he needs is sympathizing friends around him.  He is very lonesome lying
      here with no Walt Whitman to cheer him up.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been to see about getting together a package of books for you, but the booksellers
      are so busy it will be several days before I can get them packed and sent.  Let me hear from you.  I write in haste
      with numb fingers—it is bitter cold here today.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Townsend Trowbridge
      was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
      Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
      Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
      Eldridge edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He again met Whitman
      in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Treasury Secretary Salmon P.
      Chase in order to gather material for his biography, <em>The Ferry
         Boy and the Financier</em> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described
      their meetings in <em>My Own Story</em>, (Boston: Houghton and
      Mifflin, 1903), 360–401, with recollections of noted persons. On December
      11, 1862, Trowbridge had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending
      Whitman; see Emerson's letter from . Though Trowbridge was not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to
      William D. O'Connor in 1867: "Every year confirms my earliest impression, that
      no book has approached the power and greatness of this book, since the Lear and
      Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A. Coleman, "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 [1951–52], 327). For
      Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.71.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> (1906–1996), 3:506. See
      also Coleman, "Trowbridge and Whitman," <em>PMLA</em>, 63 (1948),
      262–273. For several weeks in 1863, Trowbridge stayed with Whitman in
      Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William D. O'Connor.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00876_n2">1. As Whitman informed Mrs.
      Curtis in a letter from , Caleb
      Babbitt suffered a sun stroke in July and was admitted to Armory Square
      Hospital. According to the "Hospital Note Book" (Henry E. Huntington Library),
      Babbitt had been in Mobile, Alabama, earlier. About August 1, 1863, he left
      Washington on furlough. On ,
      Caleb's sister, Mary A. Babbitt informed Whitman of Caleb's arrival in Barre,
      Massachusetts; because of his exhaustion he was unable to write. Mary
      acknowledged Whitman's letter on , and wrote that Caleb was "not quite as well as when I wrote you
      before…he wishes me to tell you to keep writing…for your letters do him more
      good than a great deal of medicine." On , at the expiration of his forty-day furlough, Caleb was strong
      enough to write: "Walt—In your letters you wish me to imagine you talking with
      me when I read them, well I do, and it does very well to think about, but it is
      nothing compared with the original." On , Babbitt was depressed—"dark clouds seem to be lying in my
      pathway and I can not remove them nor hide them from my mind"—until he mentioned
      his beloved, Nellie F. Clark, who "has saved me." On , S. H. Childs wrote for Caleb from the Massachusetts
      General Hospital, Boston: "He Is unable to set up &amp; suffers considerable
      pain In his
      head."

   <p id="loc.00876_n3">2. D. Willard Bliss
      (1825–1889) was a surgeon with the Third Michigan Infantry, and afterward
      was in charge of Armory Square Hospital. See John Homer Bliss, <em>Genealogy of the Bliss Family in America, from about the year 1550 to
         1880</em> (Boston: John Homer Bliss, 1881), 545. He practiced medicine in
      Washington after the war; see the letter from Whitman to Hiram Sholes of . When a pension for Whitman was
      proposed in the House of Representatives in 1887, Dr. Bliss was quoted: "I am of
      opinion that no one person who assisted in the hospitals during the war
      accomplished so much good to the soldiers and for the Government as Mr. Whitman"
      (Thomas Donaldson, <em>Walt Whitman the Man</em> [New York: F. P.
      Harper, 1896], 169).<a href="#r2">[back]
