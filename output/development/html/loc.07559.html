      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07559_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr R M Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden,
      N.J. | Dec 18 | 8 PM | 88.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n4132">2. Whitman's "big book" is a reference
      to his <em>Complete Prose and Poetry</em> that was published by
      David McKay of Philadelphia in 1888.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4162">3. James Francis Walsh was a young
      Camden physician who attended Whitman, visiting him nearly every day, during the
      poet's illness of 1888–89. Walsh was the brother of William S. Walsh, an
      American author and editor of <em>Lippincott's Monthly
         Magazine</em>. Whitman had a favorable opinion of Walsh because he visited
      often, watched his patient carefully, but did not give medicine. See Whitman's
      letter to Bucke of . Bucke had
      arranged to have Walsh accompany Dr. Osler to see Whitman, since Bucke believed
      it would be useful to have a younger doctor examine the poet. See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.35.html">Wednesday, December 5, 1888</a>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07559_n2">4. Vicomte Ferdinand Marie
      de Lesseps (1805–1894), promoter of the Suez Canal, was later president of
      the French company constructing the Panama Canal. The New York <em>Tribune</em> on December 18 noted the defeat of the Panama Canal bill in
      the French Chamber of Deputies.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1029">5. John Greenleaf Whittier
      (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
      slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
      surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
      Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
      volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (various publishers: 1906–1996) and Whitman's "My Tribute to Four Poets,"
      in <em>Specimen Days</em> (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh &amp; Co.,
      1882–'83), 180–181.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">6. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
