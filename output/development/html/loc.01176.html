      sweet in the spring, especially when [illegible] moistens it a little with his sweat, oh, if you could be here +
      see all this beginning of life again! I trust you do get out in your chair occasionally. It is
      a great comfort to know you was able to read your Lincoln lecture in Phil<u>a</u> Julian<sup><a href="#loc.01151_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> is well + is helping
      me hoe in the vineyards. Ursula<sup><a href="#n0892" id="r2">2</a></sup> is well + terribly busy getting
      settled. Drop me a card. I return dear Williams<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r3">3</a></sup> Donnelly<sup><a href="#n4108" id="r4">4</a></sup> pamphlet.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      (1831–1901) was a politician and writer, well known for his notions of
      Atlantis as an antediluvian civilization and for his belief that Shakespeare's

         Plays</em>, published in 1888.<a href="#r4">[back]
