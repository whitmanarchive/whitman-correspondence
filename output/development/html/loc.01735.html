   </p>
   
   
   <p>I got home all right Saturday night—&amp; have been having quite a good time. There is
      nothing 
      very new—Mother is well as usual. I shall print my College Poem in a small book—it
      will be small—&amp; is intended as the beginning of a larger one<sup><a href="#loc.01735_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I am having it set up at the printing office—will send you one in ten or twelve days.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Pete, how are you getting along—I suppose on 14<sup><a href="#loc.01735_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> the same as when I was there—I see by the papers that the head men have mostly migrated
      from Washington, 
      &amp; that it is said to be hot &amp; dull enough there<sup><a href="#loc.01735_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Do you see any thing of Mr. Tasistro? I rec'd the letter he sent to the office for
      me—I am writing this in the house in Portland av—we are having a showery afternoon—
   </p>
   
   <p>—Good bye, my darling boy—&amp; I will try to write again soon, (&amp; a more interesting
      letter)—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01735_n1">1. In the preface to this
      small pamphlet Whitman clearly states that he had completed <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and was about to start a new work—a clear
      indication, in Gay Wilson Allen's words, that "he is not sure of his new
      literary intentions" (<em>Walt Whitman Handbook</em> [Chicago:
      Packard and Company, 1946], 202).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>

      car.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.01735_n3">3. On June 12 an article in
      the New York <em>Times</em> entitled "The Deserted Capital" noted
      the absence of the President and congressmen from Washington: "The transition is
      at once from scenes of busy excitement to dull times and hot weather."<a href="#r3">[back]
