   </p>
   
   <p>I was very glad indeed to hear from you in answer to my last, and you know I could
      not but be gratified to find your business was progressing so favorably,—<sup><a href="#loc.00571_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>In accordance with not only your wishes, but my own I went to Brooklyn yesterday and
      saw your Mother.—I found her alone, Matt<sup><a href="#loc.00571_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; Jeff<sup><a href="#loc.00571_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> out walking. Eddy<sup><a href="#loc.00571_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> at church, and George<sup><a href="#loc.00571_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> out somewhere's else I suppose. She did not remember me at first but as soon as she
      did she was very much pleased. I had a long talk, and settled the old $2.00 affair
      of Matts. I came away before she and Jeff returned. Walt, Mother says she feels first
      rate, is not at all sick, and I think she looks as well now as she did while I was
      living over there.—There is no news here Walt. The last fight, the Japenese Embassy, and the Charleston Democratic Convention, fill the papers to the exclusion
      of Every thing else.<sup><a href="#loc.00571_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup>—Dunn,<sup><a href="#loc.00571_n9" id="r7">7</a></sup> the ex stage driver is in Boston with that Circus Co. I think he will call upon you
      as I gave him your address.—If you come on here this [week] Be sure and make it your
      business to call and see me. Do not neglect it please Walt, for I want to see you
      very much. Mrs. Cooper &amp; Robert<sup><a href="#loc.00569_n4" id="r8">8</a></sup> send their loves. Ever yours, In a Hurry! Fred.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Fred Vaughan was a young
      Irish stage driver with whom Whitman had an intense relationship during the late
      1850's. For discussion of Vaughan's relationship with Whitman, see Jonathan Ned
      Katz, <em>Love Stories: Sex between Men before Homosexuality</em>
      (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001), 123–132; Charley Shively,

         Camerados</em> (San Francisco: Gay Sunshine Press, 1987), 36–50; Ed

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00571_n2">1. Shively writes that "Whitman
      went to Boston in the spring of 1860 to proofread and put the final touches on
      the third edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>." See Charley
      Shively <em>Calamus Lovers: Walt Whitman's Working-Class
         Camerados.</em> (San Francisco: Gay Sunshine Press, 1987), 40.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00571_n3">2. Martha Mitchell Whitman,
      also known as "Mattie," was the wife of Whitman's younger brother Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00571_n4">3. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890) was Walt's younger brother.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00571_n5">4. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), Walt's youngest brother, was mentally and physically
      handicapped.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00571_n6">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was Walt's younger brother.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00571_n7">6. On 16 April 1860, in
      Farnborough, England, acknowledged American boxing champion John Carmel Heenan
      fought Tom Sayers, the British Champion, in the "World Championship." The fight
      was called by police before a knockout by either fighter. This fight would have
      been of particular interest to the crowd at Pfaff's as Heenan was newly married
      to Adah Isaacs Menken, a Pfaffian actress, writer, and admirer of Whitman.
      The Democratic National Convention opened on April 23, 1860, in Charleston,
      South Carolina. Northern and Southern Democrats were locked in a heated debate
      about whether or not to officially add a pro-slavery plank to the platform. By
      April 30, Northern Democrats had won the argument, but fifty Southern delegates
      stormed out in protest.
      Japan's first envoys to the United States—referred to as the Japanese
      Embassy—arrived in San Francisco in March 1860. Their progress cross-country was
      covered extensively in the press. The city-wide celebration for the embassy's
      arrival in New York would serve as the subject of Whitman's poem "The
      Errand-Bearers" (later "A Broadway Pageant"), published in the New York Times on
      June 27.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00571_n9">7. This was possibly "Collins
      Dunne," whom Whitman lists as a Harvard Square driver on a piece of letterhead
      for Osgood and Company. See <em>Daybooks and Notebooks</em>, ed.
      William White (New York: New York University Press, 1978), 1:
      238–239.<a href="#r7">[back]

      mother were Vaughan's roommates after Vaughan left Whitman's Classon Avenue
      apartment.<a href="#r8">[back]
