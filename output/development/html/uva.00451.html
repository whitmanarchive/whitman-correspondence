   <p>In a note 
      rec'd
      
       from you quite a while ago (from Johnstown, 
      Pa:) you mention some German translations of my poems by Dr ?<sup><a href="#uva.00451_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> at Berlin (since dead)—Would you please give me
      the <em>Dr's name exactly</em>—&amp; some particulars 
      ab't
      
       the translations? Did you get Dr. Bucke's volume, which was sent you
      June 21, last? I have received the translations into German, (slips, papers,
      &amp;c) you have so kindly sent me from time to time<sup><a href="#uva.00451_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—have not (otherwise) heard from you for some four months—I continue
      (though a half paralytic) well as usual—

      Karl Knortz | Cor: Morris avenue | &amp; 155th Street | New York City. It is

      In his reply, dated  by Whitman,
      Knortz wrote that Dr. Adolf Stodtmann (1829–1879) had translated eight of
      Whitman's "smaller poems" in <em>Amerikanische Anthologie</em>
      (Leipzig, 1870), 149–154: "the late Doctor did not, I am very sorry to
      say, give you a favorable introduction to the German public." Knortz also
      informed the poet that in his "critical history of American literature . . . a
      whole chapter (about 20 printed pages) will be devoted to your poetry." This
      book, <em>Geschichte der Nord-Amerikanischen Literatur</em>, did
      not appear until 1891.<a href="#r2">[back]
