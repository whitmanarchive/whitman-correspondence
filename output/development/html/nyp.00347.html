      This postcard bears the address, "Pete Doyle | M st. South bet 4½ &amp; 6th |
      Washington D.C." It is postmarked: "Philadelphia | Ju(?)| 26 | 9 PM | Pa;
      Carrier | 27 | J (?)| (?) ."<br><br>
      Since Whitman wrote to Doyle on Fridays, and since the account of his illness
      here does not contradict the account in his  letter to Ellen M. O'Connor, this postcard can be plausibly
      assigned to 1874.<a href="#r1">[back]
