   <p>Both your letters have been received, Lewy—the second one came this morning, &amp; was
      welcome, as any thing from you will always be, &amp; the sight of your face welcomer than all, my darling—I see you write in good spirits, &amp; appear to have first-rate
      times—Lew, you must not go around too much, nor eat &amp; drink too promiscuous, but be
      careful &amp; moderate, &amp; not let the kindness of friends carry you away, lest you break
      down again, dear son—I was at the hospital yesterday four or five hours, was in ward
      K—Taber<sup><a href="#loc.00886_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> has been down sick, so he had to lay abed, but he is better now, &amp; goes around as
      usual—Curly<sup><a href="#loc.00886_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> is the same as usual—most of the others are the same—there have been quite a good
      many deaths—the young man who lay in bed 2 with a very bad leg is dead—I saw Johnny
      Mahay<sup><a href="#loc.00886_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup> in ward E—poor fellow, he is very poorly, he is very thin, &amp; his face is like wax—Lew,
      I must tell you what a curious thing happened in the chaplain's<sup><a href="#loc.00886_n6" id="r4">4</a></sup> house night before last—there has been a man in ward I, named Lane, with two fingers amputated, very bad with gangrene,
      so they removed him to a tent by himself—last Thursday his wife came to see him, she
      seemed a nice woman but very poor, she stopt at the chaplain's—about 3 o'clock in the morning she got up &amp; went to the sink, &amp;
      there she gave birth to a child, which fell down the sink into the sewer runs beneath,
      fortunately the water was not turned on—the chaplain got up, carried Mrs Lane out,
      &amp; then roused up a lot of men from the hospital, with spades &amp;c. dug a trench outside,
      &amp; got into the sink, &amp; took out the poor little child, it lay there on its back, in
      about two inches of water—well, strange as it may seem, the child was alive, (it fell
      about five feet through the sink)—&amp; is now living &amp; likely to live, is quite bright,
      has a head of thick black hair—the chaplain took me in yesterday, showed me the child,
      &amp; Mrs Jackson, his wife, told me the whole story, with a good deal I havn't told you—&amp; then she treated me to a good plate of ice cream—so I staid there nearly
      an hour &amp; had quite a pleasant visit. Mrs Lane lay in an adjoining room.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Lew, as to me &amp; my affairs there is nothing very new or important—I have not succeeded
      in getting any employment here yet, except that I write a little (newspaper correspondence
      &amp;c), barely enough to pay my expenses—but it is my own fault, for I have not tried
      hard enough for any thing—the last three weeks I have not felt very well—for two or
      three days I was down sick, for the first time in my life, (as I have never before
      been sick)—I feel pretty fair to-day—I go around most every day the same as usual.
      I have some idea of giving myself a furlough of three or four weeks, &amp; going home
      to Brooklyn, N Y, but I should return again to Washington, probably. Lew, it is pretty
      hot weather here, &amp; the sun affects me—(I had a sort of sun stroke about five years
      ago)—You speak of being here in Washington again about the last of August—O Lewy,
      how glad I should be to see you, to have you with me—I have thought if it could be
      so that you, &amp; one other person &amp; myself could be where we could work &amp; live together,
      &amp; have each other's society, we three, I should like it so much—but it is probably a dream—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, Lew, they had the great battle of Gettysburgh, but it does not seem to have
      settled any thing, except to have killed &amp; wounded a great many thousand men—It seems
      as though the two armies were falling back again to near their old positions on the
      Rappahannock—it is hard to tell what will be the next move—yet, Lewy, I think we shall
      conquer yet—I don't believe it is destined that this glorious Union is to be broken
      up by all the secesh south, or copheads north either—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, my darling, I have scribbled you off something to show you where I am &amp; that
      I have rec'd your welcome letters—but my letter is not of much interest, for I don't
      feel very bright to-day—Dear son, you must write me whenever you can—take opportunity
      when you have nothing to do, &amp; write me a good long letter—your letters &amp; your love
      for me are very precious to me, for I appreciate it all, Lew, &amp; give you the like
      in return. It is now about 3 o'clock, &amp; I will go out &amp; mail this letter, &amp; then go
      &amp; get my dinner—So good bye, Lewy—good bye, my dear son &amp; comrade, &amp; I hope it will
      prove God's will that you get quite well &amp; sound yet, &amp; have many good years yet—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Lewis Kirke Brown (1843–1926) was
      wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on August 19, 1862, and lay
      where he fell for four days. Eventually he was transferred to Armory Square
      Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in February 1863. In a diary in the
      Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on February 19, 1863, as "a most
      affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come and sit by him." Because the
      wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on January 5, 1864. Whitman was
      present and described the operation in a diary (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection
      of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out
      in August 1864, and was employed in the Provost General's office in September;
      see Whitman's 
      . The following
      September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief
      of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until his retirement
      in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was prepared by Brown's
      family and is now held in the Library of Congress.) Brown had written from
      Judiciary Square Hospital on , and
      .

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00886_n3">1. On , Brown wrote to Whitman: "I suppose you herd that J. A. Tabor was
      killed. he was killed in the wilderness the second days battle. I seen some men
      out of his company &amp; they say that he fell dead when he was
      shot."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00886_n4">2. "Curly," a soldier from Ohio, is again
      referred to in a Letter from Walt Whitman to Hiram Sholes, May 30, 1867 (Edwin
      Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 1:331–332).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00886_n5">3. John Mahay, Hundred and First New York,
      was wounded in the bladder at second Bull Run, August 29, 1862. In <em>Specimen Days</em>, Whitman notes in the section dated
      February 4, 1863, that Mahay, despite his pain, "was of good heart" and "was
      delighted with a stick of horehound candy I gave him" (Richard Maurice Bucke,
      ed.,<em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New York:
      G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 4:46). Mahay is referred to as in poor health in
      this letter and in a letter dated ;
      evidently he died later in the year. In describing Mahay's death, Whitman
      writes: "Poor Mahay, a mere boy in age, but old in misfortune" (<em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>, 4:98–99).

   <p id="loc.00886_n6">4. Eliphalet W. Jackson, a chaplain in
      Armory Square Hospital, was ardently patriotic. On March 7, 1863, the <em>Washington National Republican</em> noted that at a hospital
      party Jackson proposed a lengthy resolution which began: "Resolved, That the
      rebellion now waged against our Government is the most wicked and atrocious of
      any since the days of Satan, Absalom, or Judas."<a href="#r4">[back]
