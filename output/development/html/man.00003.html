   <p>I have Burrough's book and also his last article in "Birds &amp; Poets". I have O'Connor's
      "Good Gray Poet" parts of which are beautifull—I have Mrs. Gilchrists letter in the "Radical."<sup><a href="#man.00003_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> All these and <u>anything</u> else I can get on this subject are interesting, and will be more or less usefull, to me—but what I <u>specially</u> want just now is new facts about the <u>man</u>—both bearing upon his inward and outward life—I hope you will give me any help in
      [
      <span class="unclear">reason?</span>]
       that you 
      
      
      
      can in this direction.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope that your brothers will do something for me and I hope that if you have any
      thing to say about it you will encourage them to do something<sup><a href="#man.00003_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I will return the little pamphlet<sup><a href="#man.00003_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> after awhile meantime I will take good care of it &amp; be sure not to lose it.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="man.00003_n1">1. Although the Whitman
      letter to which Bucke is responding is apparently lost—Edwin Haviland
      Miller lists a missing letter from Whitman to Bucke on 26 January 1880 (<em>Walt Whitman: The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 3:434)—it would appear that Whitman had
      sent Bucke a list of materials for use in the biography. If this is the case,
      then the following have the special sanction of the poet: John Burroughs, <em>Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</em>, 1st ed. (New
      York: American News Company, 1867); "The Flight of the Eagle," <em>Birds and Poets</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin and Company, 1877),
      185–235; William Douglas O'Connor, <em>The Good Gray Poet: A
         Vindication</em> (New York: Bunce and Huntington, 1866); and Anne Gilchrist,
      "An Englishwoman's Estimate of Walt Whitman," <em>Boston
         Radical</em>, 7 (May 1870), 345–59. In the biography, Bucke reprinted
      <em>The Good Gray Poet</em> (pp. 99–130) and extracts
      from "An Englishwoman's Estimate" (pp. 204–6).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="man.00003_n2">2. Although Whitman at this
      time was living with George Washington Whitman at 431 Stevens Street, there was
      not much sympathy between the brothers. Some notion of the attitude of the
      family may be gained from the interview with George Washington Whitman that
      Traubel conducted in 1893 ("Notes from Conversations with George W. Whitman,
      1893: Mostly in his Own Words," in <em>In Re Walt Whitman</em>,
      eds. Horace Traubel, Richard Maurice Bucke, and Thomas B. Harned [Philadelphia:
      McKay, 1893], 33–40). Discussing the publication of the first edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, George remarked: "I was about
      twenty-five then. I saw the book—didn't read it all—didn't think it
      worth reading—fingered it a little. Mother thought as I did—did not
      know what to make of it" (35).<a href="#r2">[back]
