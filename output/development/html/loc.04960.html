      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your kind post-card of Sept. 30<u>th</u> rec<u>d</u> on the 11<u>th</u> inst, and the pocket-book copy of
      L. of G. received this morning. Many thanks.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am glad to hear of the visit from John Burroughs,<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r1">1</a></sup> which I know
      would be a very great pleasure to you both. He told D<u>r</u>
      J.<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r2">2</a></sup> that he wished very much that he could persuade you to
      <u>live</u> near him.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>D<u>r</u> Johnston tells me that a friend of ours, + a
      school-fellow of mine,—Fred Wild—is likely to call upon you. He has been
      spending a little time in Canada, + wrote home that he would return by New York, +
      would probably go on to Camden to see you. D<u>r</u> J. sent you
      a telegram to that effect last week. I understand, however, that he is likely to
      have left America before this reaches you. I spent 3 days in Yorkshire last
      week—so ending my holiday.—I am by no means so much [
      <span class="unclear">recruited?</span>]
       in health as I
      expected, but hope to improve gradually as time goes on.
   </p>
   
   <p>The weather here is broken—two or three days of fair weather alternating with a
      few days of rain. Fairly warm so far, getting colder at nights.
   </p>
   
   <p>Looking through some old papers the other day I came across a cutting from the "<u>Sunday Chronicle</u>" dated Feb 27<u>th</u>
      1887. Probably you have not seen it, and I think I will enclose it. It is of very
      slight value but is interesting because of its source—the S. C. having a large
      circulation amongst the working classes here + being very radical + heterodox in
      character.—It pays you the left-handed compliment of professing to employ a
      "Walt Whitman junior" on its staff, whose verses often appear but do no credit to
      the name!
   </p>
   
   <p>D<u>r</u> Johnston seems in good health now + very busy.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope that the "grippe" has now left you, +, with love + best wishes always,
      remain
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0129">1. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
