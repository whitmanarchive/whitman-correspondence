   <p> Thank you deeply for sending the excellent picture of Father Taylor<sup><a href="#med.00765_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—just what I wanted—I have penned a short
      informal reminiscence of Father T (in 1859) which may be printed in a
      magazine—If so I shall send you a copy.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00765_n1">1. On May 7, 1884, Whitman
      requested "a good photo (or other picture)" of Father Edward Thompson Taylor
      (1793–1871) for use in his article, but Whitman's remembrance, "Father
      Taylor and Oratory," did not appear until 1887.<a href="#r1">[back]
