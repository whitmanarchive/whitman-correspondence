   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The <em>New York Herald</em> (1835–1924), 
      a daily newspaper, became one of the longest running newspapers. The <em>Herald</em>
      was founded by James Gordon Bennett, Sr., and his son, James Gordon Bennett, Jr
      (1841–1918) was the editor and publisher of the <em>
         Herald</em>, during the time Whitman published poems and prose pieces in the paper. Whitman published
      his largest
      number of periodical poems in the <em>Herald</em>. For more information on the paper and Whitman's
      contributions, see Susan Belasco, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_titles/per.00104.html">New York Herald</a>."
