      <br></br><br></br>Dear John Burroughs
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter, &amp; was glad to hear from you—I am still in a pretty bad way—I am writing
      this over at the office, at my desk, but feel to-day more like laying down than sitting
      up—I do not walk any better, &amp; my head has frequent distress—Still, for all that I
      slowly gain strength—very slowly—&amp; <u>shall</u> <u>yet</u> <u>get</u> <u>well</u> as ever—Every thing goes on about the same, in the sphere of my affairs, &amp;c. as when
      I last saw you—Mother is at Camden—mopes &amp; worries a good deal about me—I don't feel like leaving here,
      for visiting or any purpose, until I get so I can move about—The
      
      
      
      
      doctor is applying electricity, every other day—I have had it now five or six times—I
      anticipate benefit in a while, but it makes no perceptible difference yet—How and
      where is 'Sula?—I wish I was where I could come in &amp; see her &amp; you often—(those nice
      breakfasts were bright spots, &amp; I shall not forget them)—if I could just get 'round
      and sit an hour or so for a change, &amp; chat with 'Sula and you, two or three times
      a week, I believe it would do me good—but I must take it out in imagination—for it
      is impossible in reality—
   </p>
   
   <p>—I got a long letter from Dowden—he mentions you—As I sit I look over from my office window on the President's grounds—the
      grass is green enough—they have already been over it once with the cutter, &amp; Saturday
      there were men out there in their shirt-sleeves raking it up—I have a big bunch of
      lilacs in a pitcher in my room—
   </p>
   
   <p>—Washington looks about the same—rather cool &amp; cloudy to-day—but pleasant weather
      may-be by the time you receive this—best love to you &amp; 'Sula
