      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been thinking about you this morning, and will write a few lines, 
      though without any thing special to communicate. My vacation is nearly done, 
      &amp; in four or five days more I shall be back in Washington. I have been here in 
      Providence the past week, as guest of Thomas Davis, a manufacturer here, 
      &amp; formerly M. C.—have had a good time generally, in a quiet way—am going on to New
      York this afternoon, &amp; shall be back in Washington on the 27th—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>William O'Connor<sup><a href="#duk.00654_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> is here in Providence—I have been with him a good deal—he is not very well, but goes
      around—Will finish my letter in New York, 
      &amp; mail it thence to-morrow.<sup><a href="#duk.00654_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="duk.00654_n1">1. Before he returned to
      Washington, O'Connor called on Walt Whitman's mother in Brooklyn, as mentioned
      in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's 
      letter to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00654_n2">2. The sale at the American
      Art Association on March 11, 1924, listed a one-page letter to Burroughs on
      October 23, 1868, which stated that Walt Whitman intended to spend a few days in
      New York before he returned to Washington.<a href="#r2">[back]
