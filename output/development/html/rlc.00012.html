   <p>Yours<sup><a href="#n0793" id="r1">1</a></sup> of June 26<sup><a href="#rlc.00012_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> duly arrived some days
      since. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>1) I have sent a paper to Kr. Elster<sup><a href="#n0216" id="r3">3</a></sup> at Throudhjem, containing my
      last, (the College poem) &amp; a piece in about my sickness. I sent you a copy same paper.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>2) The letter you speak of, (March 20,) duly reached me. I have no doubt, dear friend,
      that
      all the letters, papers, sheets, &amp;c. during the last three years sent me by your loving
      kindness &amp; attention have every one reached me. (The post office here is among the
      best
      things of the New World—is sure, quick, cheap, &amp; every way admirable. If letters
      addressed to me go to other cities, as they sometimes do, they are pretty sure eventually
      to
      come <em>here</em>—the post office men, even the carriers, are
      wonderfully bright &amp; intuitive.) 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>3) I will be on the look out for John Burroughs's photograph—he is well at last
      accounts. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>4) I myself have <em>pleased myself</em> more fully with <em>Redwood Tree</em><sup><a href="#n0578" id="r4">4</a></sup> than any of my pieces of late years.<sup><a href="#rlc.00012_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> But it
      is generally thought wild &amp; cloudy here—(the <em>Columbus</em> is
      more popular far)—I suppose it is hardly necessary to tell you that I have <em>pitched</em> and <em>keyed</em> my pieces more with reference
      to fifty years hence, &amp; how they will stand mellowed and toned <em>then</em>—than to pleasing &amp; tickling the immediate impressions of the present
      hour. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>6)<sup><a href="#rlc.00012_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> I have not heard any thing more of C. Petersen
      lately—but if I meet with any thing of his printed, I will send you. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>7) All the criticisms, Danish papers, &amp; those from Norway, duly 
      rec'd
      
      —to be carefully translated &amp; read to me—<em>I prize
         them all, very much</em>—but I am yet feeble, &amp; read, write &amp;c. as little as
      possible. 8) One or two little items have been in the papers here about the <em>Fremblik</em> translation. I get along with your English very well
      indeed—

   <p>Rudolf Schmidt My dear friend,</p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of July 28, from Gaûsdal,<sup><a href="#rlc.00012_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup> in "old Norway"
      reached me 
      to-day
      
      . Quite curiously, on the very same day, I was writing to you—as per sheet
      accompanying, written at date (a month ago) but not sent until I could add further.
      I am
      glad to get your letter from Norway—am still laid up sick &amp; lonesome
      here—do not seem to get any thing like well, &amp; at times the prospect is very
      uncertain—yet maintain a steady heart. I was dismissed from my clerkship under
      Government at Washington about two months ago. I write this by my open window—the
      majestic &amp; beautiful Delaware flows near, in sight—we have had a fine summer in
      America—&amp; now a spell of rich, golden, mellow weather—far &amp; near
      wonderful crops of every thing—now beginning to be gathered.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0793">1. Rudolf Schmidt, a Dane and
      editor of <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em>, is credited with
      introducing Walt Whitman to Scandinavia by quoting translated passages from <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in a 1872 essay in his magazine. He wrote
      to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871:
      "I intend to write
      an article about yourself and your writings in the above named periodical which
      is very much read in all the Scandinavian countries. ... I therefore take the
      liberty to ask you, if you should not be willing to afford some new
      communications of yourself and your poetry to this purpose" (The Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0216">3. Kristian Elster (1841–1881) was a Norwegian
      novelist whose work focused on cultural conflict, as in his 1872 pamphlet "On
      the contrast between the western and the eastern parts of Norway." According to
      Carl Roos, Elster was a friend of Björnstjerne Björnson (1832–1910),
      Norwegian poet, dramatist, and novelist; see <em>Orbis
         Litterarum</em>, VII (1949), 51n.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0578">4. In a ,
      letter, Walt Whitman offered "Song of the Redwood-Tree" to Henry M. Alden,
      editor of <em>Harper's Monthly Magazine</em>. Of "Song of the
      Redwood-Tree" Rudolf Schmidt observed: "It is your old great theme in a simple
      and powerful stile, embracing the holy and original nation of the far West"
      (Syracuse University; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], 4:464). For digital images of the poem as it
