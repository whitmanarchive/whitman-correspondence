      entirely satisfactory &amp; I want to see what [I] can do to print them, so as each to
      illustrate in the <em>Nov.Boughs</em><sup><a href="#n3999" id="r3">3</a></sup>—one of each<sup><a href="#nyp.00719_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Of course some
      one—the proper person (is it not Phila or N Y?)—will have to print 1000
      picts—will have to be done for ab't 3ct each—I am having a bad
      day—had about a bad night—

      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel (1856–1914), was
      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on his relationship with Whitman, see

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4325">1. Francis (Frank) Parkerson Harned
      (1849–1934) was Tom Harned's brother; he was a chemist and the founder of
      the Penn Chemical Works.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4265">2. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a
      traveling Quaker preacher and anti-slavery activist from Long Island, New York.
      For more on Hicks, see Henry Watson Wilbur, <em>The Life and
         Labors of Elias Hicks</em> (Philadelphia: Friends' General Conference
      Advancement Committee, 1910).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n3999">3. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00719_n1">4. Frank Harned, who began
      to photograph the Sidney Morse bust of Whitman around June 8, brought them for
      Whitman's inspection on July 2 (see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.72.html">Friday, June 8, 1888</a> and <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.96.html">Monday, July 2, 1888</a>). Despite what Whitman said in this letter,
      Traubel reports on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.98.html">Wednesday, July 4, 1888</a> that "W. has not seemed to like Frank
      Harned's pictures," and they did not appear in the printed book.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4262">5. James Gordon Bennett Jr.
      (1841–1918) was the publisher of the <em>New York
         Herald,</em> which had been founded by his father in 1835. For more on the
      paper and the many poems by Whitman that were published in it, see Susan
      Belasco, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_titles/per.00104.html">The <em>New York Herald</em></a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00719_n2">6. Bennett sent a check for
      $40 after Whitman stopped sending poems to the newspaper, and refused to
      accept the check back when the poet returned it (see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.103.html">Monday, July 9, 1888</a> and <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.105.html">Wednesday, July 11, 1888</a>).<a href="#r6">[back]
