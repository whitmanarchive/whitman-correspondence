      <br></br><br></br>Dear John Burroughs
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am passing a good part of my time down here at the farm I believe I mentioned to
      you. Still keep well for me &amp; jolly—am all tann'd &amp; sunburnt—Eat my rations every time—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was up yesterday to Camden to get my mail—&amp; found <em>the book</em><sup><a href="#uva.00378_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—read it all over with appreciative &amp; I think critical eyes—my impression of liking
      it, as a curiously <em>homogeneous</em> work—(just enough radiations to make it <em>piquant</em>)—&amp; in connection <em>liking the name</em> &amp;c—all deepened &amp; clinched. I especially much like—&amp; more like—the chapter about
      me. There has certainly been nothing yet said that so makes the points—(&amp; eloquently
      makes them—) I most want brought out &amp; put on record—Are you coming to the Gilchrists?
      &amp; when?<sup><a href="#uva.00378_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00378_n1">1. This letter is endorsed in
      an unknown hand: "5 | 18 | '77." It bears the address: John Burroughs |
      Esopus-on-Hudso[n] | Ulster County New York. It is postmarked: Philadelphia |
      May 18 | 1 PM | Pa.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00378_n2">2. Walt Whitman had been
      with the Staffords before he returned to Camden on May 15; he went back to
      Kirkwood on the following day and remained there until May 22 (<em>The Commonplace Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00378_n3">3. This is a reference to
      Burroughs' <em>Birds and Poets</em>. According to <em>The Commonplace Book</em>, however, Walt Whitman received the
      book on May 23 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00378_n4">4. Burroughs was expected to
      visit the Gilchrists in June (see the letter from Walt Whitman to Anne and
      Herbert Gilchrist on ), but he
      apparently was unable to come to Philadelphia.<a href="#r4">[back]
