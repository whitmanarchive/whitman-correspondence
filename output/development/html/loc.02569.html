   </p>
   
   <p>Over two weeks ago I determined to let Major Pond manage your lecture.<sup><a href="#n3112" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>He is "up" in that kind of business and knew just how to do it. He paid I might
      calculate $350, as the cost—the output, and he would guarantee to fill a
      hall. I at once assumed the responsibility &amp; became security for the $350— 
   </p>
   
   <p>He then tried to get Chickering Hall but it was engaged for April 14th &amp; also for
      every afternoon &amp; evening  about that date. We have at last settled upon the Madison Square
      Theater for the afternoon (4 o'clock) of April 14. I must pay the $75. for the
      Theater the moment it is engaged, &amp; I will do so, the moment I receive a telegram
      from you tomorrow saying "all right, go ahead."<sup><a href="#loc.02569_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Please wire me at once on receipt of this. </p>
   
   <p>Alma<sup><a href="#n3029" id="r3">3</a></sup> is here with me &amp; is well &amp; says "Lots of love &amp; thanks for the nice
      letter 
      rec'd
      
       at Equinunk"<sup><a href="#loc.02569_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> —Ever yours

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3112">1. James Burton Pond (1838–1903)
      was a famous lecture-manager and printer. He was also awarded the Medal of Honor
      for his services in the Civil War. In his 1900 autobiography <em>Eccentricities of Genius</em> (G. W. Dillingham Co: New York), he writes
      about Whitman: "Walt Whitman gave a few readings under my management during his
      life. They were mostly testimonials from friends, and benefits given in the
      theatres of New York City"; he concludes with an anecdote about the poet's
      meeting with Sir Edwin Arnold (p. 497–501).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02569_n1">2. The event took place and was
      apparently a great success. James B. Pond recounts it as follows: "It was indeed
      a picturesque spectacle at Walt's last appearance in the Madison Square Theatre,
      on Lincoln's birthday. Just as he was about to recite 'My Captain,' a little
      girl, the granddaughter of Edmund Clarence Stedman, walked out upon the stage
      and presented him with a beautiful bouquet of roses" (<em>Eccentricities of Genius</em>, G. W. Dillingham Co: New York, 1900,
      497).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3029">3. Alma Calder Johnston was an author
      and the second wife of John H. Johnston. Her family owned a home and property in
      Equinunk, Pennsylvania. For more on the Johnstons, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>" (<em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
