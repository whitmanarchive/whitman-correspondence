   <p>Beyond O'Kane's<sup><a href="#n0454" id="r2">2</a></sup> copies of Leaves of Grass (200 or about), and the
      copies (27 was it?) of the '67 edition you got of Shephard,<sup><a href="#loc.01718_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> four
      or five weeks ago—with the remaining copies (if any) of the 25 sent by my order two
      months since to Piper<sup><a href="#n0672" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; Co.—<em>there are, positively, no other
         copies in existence, &amp; of course none in the market</em>. There are no other copies in
      N.Y.—none in Boston—none in Washington—whatever you were "told"—none
      <em>anywhere</em> in America. A hundred copies were sent by me to England
      about a year &amp; a half ago.<sup><a href="#loc.01718_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> But these have certainly been
      mostly sold. I made &amp; exclusively own the plates, &amp; of course [<em>indecipherable</em>]. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>What I told you in our interview, upon that subject, you must remember, &amp; can fully
      depend on &amp; act on. I have somewhere between 300 &amp; 350 of my little book of later
      poems, "As a Strong Bird on Pinions free," bound &amp; ready, I should like to furnish
      you
      with—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Should be willing—guaranteeing the just mentioned—to make over the whole of the
      copies L of G. and every thing to you on liberal terms, one half cash down, the remainder
      in
      three months—with a guarantee that no new edition of L of G. or any of these books
      shall be put out for at least six months. If you care to have the <em>sole
         &amp; exclusive</em> command of all my books in existence, take this offer. I am sick
      &amp; paralyzed—a tedious prospect still before me—&amp; should be glad to have
      the books off my hands. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>About Piper's debt, take <em>this</em> note &amp; collect it when you go to
      Boston. The one I furnished you with, is for a wrong 
      am't
      
      . Destroy it. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Please get the books from O'Kane, soon as convenient, &amp; send me receipt specifying
      number—also receipt for those of ed. '67.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01718_n1">1. This draft letter is endorsed, "To | A. K.
      Butts | 36 Dey st | N. Y."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0454">2. O'Kane, a New York book dealer, took over the books
      still in the possession of Michael Doolady (a bookseller to whom Whitman wrote
      on ) on April 22, 1874. On
      December 29, 1873, Walt Whitman withdrew his books from O'Kane, and also
      dismissed Piper, the Boston outlet. At the same time he entrusted the whole
      matter to Asa K. Butts &amp; Co., which went into bankruptcy in the following
      year. Though Walt Whitman wrote cordially to O'Kane on , he later became hostile. Citing only the initials,
      Richard Maurice Bucke, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (1883), in his
      "official" biography (46), averred that O'Kane and Somerby, Butts's successor,
      "took advantage of [Walt Whitman's] helplessness to embezzle the amounts
      due—(they calculated that death would soon settle the score and rub it out.)"
      This sounds like an interpolation composed by the poet himself; note also
      Whitman's , letter to Jeannette
      Gilder, in which he wrote, "every one of the three successive book agents I have
      had in N. Y. has embezzled the proceeds." In an address book (The Library of
      Congress #108) Walt Whitman scrawled on a piece of O'Kane's stationery,
      "rascal."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01718_n2">3. Lee, Shepard, &amp; Dillingham,
      booksellers also mentioned in Whitman's  letter to Francis B. Felt.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0672">4. William H. Piper &amp; Co. were Boston booksellers.
      In a letter on , John T. Trowbridge
      wrote that William H. Piper &amp; Co. was willing to take 50 copies of the new
      edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, and that he could personally
      recommend the firm. The firm was advertised as Whitman's Boston agent in books
      published in 1871 and 1872.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01718_n3">5. Redfield sent <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em> and <em>Leaves of Grass</em> to Sampson, Low &amp;
      Co., London booksellers. According to a statement dated December 31, 1872, the
      firm had on hand at that time 48 copies of the prose tract and 41 copies of the
      poetry (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., Library of Congress).
      According to a notation in his Commonplace Book, the account was closed in 1876,
      when the firm sent $9 to Walt Whitman through William Michael Rossetti (Charles
      E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.). In his  letter, Whitman noted that Trübner also had copies.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0133">6. Asa K. Butts was a New York bookseller at 39 Dey
      Street. Walt Whitman was having difficulties— real or imaginary, as his mother
      might have said—with booksellers. When Walt Whitman wrote this letter, he had
      decided to let Butts, as he said, "have actual &amp; complete control of the
      sales." Commenting on one of the letters of Butts, Walt Whitman observed to
      Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> in 1889:
      "What a sweat I used to be in all the time . . . over getting my damned books
      published! When I look back at it I wonder I didn't somewhere or other on the
      road chuck the whole business into oblivion" (III, 561). Butts went bankrupt in
      1874.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0356">7. Lee, Shepard, &amp; Dillingham, publishers and
      booksellers, had offices at 47–49 Green Street, New York. In 1867
      Trowbridge attempted to interest this firm in the fourth edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>; see Trowbridge's letter to O'Connor on
      March 24, 1867, reprinted in <em>American Literature</em>, XXIII
      (1951), 326. The firm was listed as one of "the mercantile failures" in the
      September 18, 1875, edition of the New York <em>Times</em> after
      losing nearly $100,000 after a fire at their Boston office. The booksellers had
      recovered by February 1876, however, when they published S. B. Perry's <em>Manual of Bible Selections and Responsive Exercises</em>,
      which advocated the use of the Bible in public school education.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0465">8. Written to commemorate the opening of the Suez Canal
      in November 1869, "Passage to India" was, according to Walt Whitman's , letter to Moncure D. Conway, the
      poet's attempt to "celebrate in my own way, the modern engineering masterpieces
      . . . the great modern material practical energy &amp; works." Although Whitman
      submitted the poem to the <em>Overland Monthly</em> on , it was rejected on , for being "too long and too
      abstract for the harty and material-minded readers of the <em>O.
         M.</em>" Conway, Walt Whitman's agent in England, was not able to sell the
      poem to an English journal. John Burroughs observed in the second edition of his
      <em>Notes on Walt Whitman as a Poet and Person</em> (1871),
      123: "The manuscript of <em>Passage to India</em> was refused by
      the monthly magazines successively in New York, Boston, San Francisco, and
      London." The poem was eventually published in the final three editions of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1871, 1881, and 1891).<a href="#r8">[back]
