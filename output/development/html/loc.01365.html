      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am pretty fair in health &amp;c of late &amp; now—pleasant weather here for
      several weeks—rainy of late—Y'r nice letter from Switzerland came
      yesterday—one from your father also just rec'd, enclosing the J A Symonds'<sup><a href="#n0615" id="r2">2</a></sup> note in answer to Swinburne's<sup><a href="#n0610" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      article—(the article was not worth answering at all—I have not given it
      a thought)—
   </p>
   
   <p>Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> has been here for five or six days—leaves
      to-night—he is well—hearty as ever &amp; much the same—he has (in
      London Canada) one of the plaster heads<sup><a href="#loc.01365_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup>, &amp; is quite enthusiastic ab't it—I
      suppose the one I sent to y'r father has been rec'd before this—I think it had
      better be donated to the Kensington Museum, if they will accept it &amp; give it a
      fair place—Morse<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r6">6</a></sup> is still here (in Phila)—is at work on his statuette
      of President Cleveland—H Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r7">7</a></sup> is here—he is
      at this moment giving some final touches on his oil painting of me—I like
      it—Some think it too <u>tame</u>—you will doubtless
      see it, as G. leaves here (NY) on the 21st on the Germania—
   </p>
   
   <p>Phila is all agog now &amp; for three days to come with the centennial of the
      Constitution (the idea is good, perhaps sublime, but the carrying out of it more or
      less tawdry &amp; vulgar)—I am sitting here in the great chair, down
      stairs—window open—big bunches of flowers on the sill—every thing
      all right—had toast &amp; a great mug of Whitman's chocolate &amp; hot milk
      (excellent) for my breakfast—Love to Alys<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n1" id="r8">8</a></sup>, to the
      baby,<sup><a href="#n3137" id="r9">9</a></sup> &amp; to all—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.01365_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Mrs. Mary Whitall Costelloe | 40 Grosvenor Road | the Embankment | London s w |
      England. This postal card is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | Sep 14 | 1:30 PM | 87.
      The envelope contains print text in the lower left-hand corner of Walt Whitman's

   <p id="n0615">2. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0610">3. Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) was a
      British poet, critic, playwright, and novelist. He was also one of Whitman's
      earliest English admirers. At the conclusion of <em>William Blake:
         A Critical Essay</em> (1868), 300–303, Swinburne pointed out
      similarities between Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly
      Rocking" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the
      most sweet and sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world." His
      famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America" is included in <em>Songs
         before Sunrise</em> (1871). For the story of Swinburne's veneration of
      Whitman and his later recantation, see two essays by Terry L. Meyers, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00740.pdf">Swinburne and Whitman: Further Evidence</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 14 (Summer 1996), 1–11 and "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00902.pdf">A
         Note on Swinburne and Whitman</a>," <em>WWQR</em> 21 (Summer

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="n0862">6. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n0262">7. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
