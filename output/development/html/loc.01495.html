      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr
      Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Since I wrote last I received a letter from you, acknowledging my 
      Shakspeare
      
       book, the 
      E.A.
      
       Poe newspaper, &amp; that with the lecture on Shakespeare in
      it. Thank you for all. It is very pleasant to think that you remember me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The news of your health is that of the chief interest to me. And in one way or
      another I have heard about you several Times. I trust you do not work when you ought
      to rest. For any affection such as yours I should suppose entire rest &amp; open air
      to be essential conditions of recovery; &amp; such lying fallow would be fruitful in
      the End with you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nevertheless I rejoice to hear of the  Two Rivulets &amp; your Memoranda of the war being ready. I
      enclose a draft or bill on the Bank of England for what they tell me is the
      Equivalent of ten dollars. Would you please send me the new Edition of 
      L. of G.
      
       &amp; Two Rivulets, &amp; Memoranda, but if the Postage is heavy don't
      send the Memoranda, &amp; let that so far compensate you for your loss by postage to
      Ireland. I should like to have my name written in Each book by you. (unless you
      object)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you have seen Peter Bayne's vicious (&amp; the word is applicable in a
      literary sense as well as an Ethical) article on your writings in The Contemporary
      Review. As to myself I feel that I have a small grievance  to complain of—his selecting
      scraps from my Westminster article, out of connection with their environment, to
      Employ against you as admissions of one who stands on your side. I trust you have
      not so far forgotten my article as to think my meaning was that Attributed to me by
      Peter Bayne. Such an article as this may with some readers delay the understanding
      of your book, but others, as I know, will have their curiosity quickened by it to
      see for themselves what the phenomenon—<u>
         L. of G.
         
         </u>—really is. I see on all sides Tokens of a continuous
      advance in England towards appreciation of your poetry. Occasional references to
      Walt Whitman in reviews &amp; magazine articles now, as a rule, tacitly admit your
      position as secured, instead of being  as once was the case, contemptuous. I will send, if I can find
      it, a copy of an article by a young barrister friend of mine, O'Grady, which
      appeared in The Gentleman's magazine the same month in which Peter Bayne's article
      appeared.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Lately I read a paper on your poems before a Club here—<u>The
         Fortnightly Club</u> &amp; The feeling was, to a degree which surprised me,
      favourable to your writings; &amp; in College I read the same paper to a large class
      of students reading along passages from your <u>Vistas</u> &amp;
      <u>
         L. of G,
         
         </u> to which a response of almost involuntary applause was
      given,—a murmur &amp; low response of satisfaction after complete silence
      &amp; attention.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had a pleasant letter from John Burroughs, &amp; got from him  a copy of his <u>Winter Sunshine.</u> This is to me a delightful little book. He is so close to
      nature, yet with such a quick, living human consciousness. His writing has some of
      the wholesome influence upon me that the sunshine, &amp; snow, the apples &amp; the
      birds themselves have: and this is all the more precious to me because my work as
      Professor has a constant tendency to tide me away from what is fresh &amp; vital
      into mere accumulation, &amp; "culture", of a kind which is not life, but mere
      apparatus, machinery, &amp; dead pelf of knowledge.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Swinburne's "<u>Erechtheus</u> "the critics here are going into
      fits of admiration about. I am disappointed by it. In comparison with it <u>Atalanta in Calydon</u> was severe in style; here everything
      is lost &amp; 
      engulphed
      
       in a welter
      of words. And Browning's new poem,—in spite of continued loyalty to
      Browning,— afflicts me by its choice of an unworthy
      subject.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A friend of mine—Miss West—has printed a little pamphlet of verses which
      perhaps she may send to you. They are some in sonnet form; &amp; as regards
      executive power very unequal: for prose &amp; not verse is her fine medium of
      expression. The spirit of them is somewhat stern &amp; self repressive; yet a
      capacity for joy is apparent in them; several are occupied with religious doubt,
      &amp; Emotions connected with it; &amp; in the last two or three the result arrived
      at is declared—a stoical acceptance of our ignorance of the mystery of the
      world; with a certain amount of hope, founded upon the good things of human
      friendship &amp; fellowship which life has revealed to the writer. (I write of what
      you have not seen, &amp; I am not sure that she will think them worth sending to
      you).
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      I am, dear friend,
      <br></br>Yours most truly,
      <br></br>Edward Dowden.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
