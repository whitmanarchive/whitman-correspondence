      <br></br><br></br>O Walt!
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Take this Calamus leaf at the hands of him thou hast sought for.<sup><a href="#syr.00019_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Lo! I am he.</p>
   
   <p> What shall I say, or how shall I utter the radiant feelings that gush from my heart
      at the magical words thou hast sung to the unknown? like as the waters at Moses
      command gushed out form the rock in the desert. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Long had I wandered alone in the earth nor met with a friend or a lover. And wonder
      not that my tongue now stutters and falters, for never before have I been allowed
      to
      express my love to a living soul. And none can comprehend the extent of my ecstasy
      who
      hath not passed like Dante from hell to the light.
   </p>
   
   <p>'Twas at midnight and we lay alone (remember thy words) when first we met, and O the
      flush of o'erwhelming joy that shot through my heart and set my pulses throbbing
      with a wild exaltation that hath not faded away.
   </p>
   
   <p> I need not demand thy love, for that has been given. I have embraced thee and thou
      hast returned my embrace. Utterly thine am I and thou art mine own, and no one in
      all the world is like to us twain. Nor need I repeat again what thou hast depicted,
      nor add my silver words to thine of redeemed gold.
   </p>
   
   <p> O thou hast not written in vain! Well didst thou know an echo would somewhere be
      found, fearing only (didst thou not fear?) that it would not reach thine ears in the
      day of thy sojourn here. 
   </p>
   
   <p> But now thou wantest myself. Then listen, brother &amp; lover. Let me unroll the
      extensive panorama of my own personality. 
   </p>
   
   <p> 1. </p>
   
   <p> First for the account of its growth up till now (for it has not and never will have
      done growing): At 14 I was a freethinker, at 15 a Buddhist, at 16 a Mohammedan, at
      17 a follower of Carlyle,<sup><a href="#n0139" id="r2">2</a></sup> at 18 a Darwinian,<sup><a href="#n3075" id="r3">3</a></sup> at 19 a sceptic and almost materialist, at 20 a human universalist: these are
      but rough landmarks. I have been an atheist and a pantheist. I have been a Stoic and
      an Epicurean, a follower of Plato, and of Diogenes. I have been an admirer of the
      man Jesus and of the Struggle for Existence, an idealist and a materialist, a
      misanthrope and a philanthropist. I have been a Liberal and a Radical, a Socialist
      and an Anarchist. And I am still all these and much moreover. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I glory in my mutability and my vast receptivity; I glory in having no unalterable
      opinions. I glory in my invincible supremacy over prejudice, my superb contempt for
      custom. Finality is the only thing that is impossible to me. The only idea I fight
      against is the idea of fixed principles: against the possession of such I revolt and
      stand on my guard, for I know that, as necessary as is its perfect poise to the
      magnet, unswerving endeavor coupled with inexhaustible liberty is the only price of
      Truth. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I have pondered on Life &amp; Death &amp; the Universe more than anyone else that is
      alive: but now I am no more troubled about them. If I am to be immortal, it does
      not trouble me; and if I am to be annihilated, that does not trouble me. For I have
      so diminished the separateness of my identity that I have already partly  ceased to exist,
      and I have so transfused my essence with the Universe round me that while it lasts
      I
      cannot be altogether annihilated. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I have accepted the Universe. Wherefore it has come to pass that I am as Godlike
      as
      God is, for God cannot cause anything to happen that I have not agreed to and willed
      beforehand. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Also, I laugh at the smallness of this little earth; with thumb at the North Pole
      and finger at South Pole I can grasp it and pinch it together. And the solar
      system is absurd in mine eyes, the sun and all his planets are so small. 
   </p>
   
   <p> (A word is written on externals.) </p>
   
   <p> Although I am not of thine in birth, yet that may be perhaps be forgiven, for what
      is a country, or what is a world, in the depths of the All? And is even Identity or
      Separation so beautiful as Nothing or Cohesion? And anyway can Sentiment stand in
      the place of Truth? 
   </p>
   
   <p> Easy to me was thy paradox. I answer it by this riddle of mine own, for thee to
      read: The segment is as circular as the circle, but it is not half so beautiful. 
   </p>
   
   <p> 2 </p>
   
   <p> Love alone is my master, to him I succumb and surrender. He is the author of all
      my
      suffering, but he hath redeemed my soul. (And alas! for the blasphemous scruples of
      prudish harlots, I have not seen the loving entire of thee; only thine English
      presentment reached me last week,—selected too by a mild, well-meaning soul who
      "admits" thy "boundless self-assertion" a "serious fault."—For me, who love
      thee, thou canst not assert thyself enough.) 
   </p>
   
   <p> Love is my lord and king and only god, and yet I know not what it is to be
      loved,—did not, let me say, till I met thyself. For when I was but fifteen I
      loved in vain, loved with a holy, yearning, obstinate love, loved a being too weak
      for me to reproach. Pardon me that the flesh-wielded pen returns with a sad delight
      to the thought of bygone loves. And O how joyfully now can I look again at the
      sorrowful, sorrowful times I have left behind. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I assure thee that from that time to the present there has never elapsed one moment
      in which I would not have welcomed death. I assure thee that when I was but
      seventeen I bore poison constantly about with me, meditating the example of
      Chatterton.<sup><a href="#syr.00019_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> I assure thee that when Carlyle died I
      almost shed tears, I, who since my childhood have never wept. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I assure that I wrote letters at midnight to an imaginary friend! To him I said
      thus: "I feel a large fountain of love running waste in my heart, &amp; I want someone
      to
      partake of it; I thirst for someone to love and to be loved by. And will a merciful
      God let me thirst in vain for ever? Surely not. O my friend, mayst thou never feel
      such heaviness of heart as I sometimes feel." (O wherefore did I not meet thee then?)
      And elsewhere I wrote: "O could our souls together climb above this realm of earthly
      clods and soar aloft like demigods, To watch the travail-throes of Time!" All these
      were meant for thee, and more I need not now extract. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Hast thou had experience such as I speak of? Hast thou known what it is to live
      unloved? 
   </p>
   
   <p> With parents whose affection is no boon to me (for without it be accompanied by
      understanding, what is such affection better, after all, than the beast's?), with
      relations not even friendly, without a single lover, or friend, or intimate or
      companion. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Such is the curse of the Truth-seeker; but the Universe is his reward. </p>
   
   <p> And I had steeled my heart to desertion, and they that marked me said: "This mortal
      has never loved, a selfish satirical cynic is he, whose heart is only a palpitating
      stone." Yet knew I that somewhere, far in the Universe, there dwelt a spirit in pure
      accord  with mine,
      strong &amp; weak &amp; high &amp; tender &amp; large &amp; true. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Now dost thou know as much, perhaps more of me than I know of myself, for these
      blunt words to thee will be subtle directions. (And of what account are words except
      for the impression produced? And no words ever yet produced quite the same
      impression on two different personalities.) 
   </p>
   
   <p> And if thou wouldst enquire of evil qualities and vices, I have all thine evil
      qualities and vices, but I do not acknowledge them to be evil nor vicious. (I have
      expunged the word "SIN" from my writings.) And I take pleasure in what men would
      call my personal defects for I can, standing by as it were an outsider, perceive
      them working together to influence my identity for good. 
   </p>
   
   <p> And if though wouldst know me, as I write, even to the innermost core, go forth at
      night and gaze for a silent hour into the mighty deeps of the far-off stars. 
   </p>
   
   <p> 3 </p>
   
   <p> My soul and heart has thou seen, and now my mental directions. </p>
   
   <p> I am a singer or writer of verses or perhaps,—but I do not yet appraise
      myself. I have written plays, comedy &amp; tragedy, allegory, satire and biting
      political pieces, a few of them printed! also a multitude of sonnets, with other pieces
      
      serious &amp; pleasant, too numerous to be mentioned.
   </p>
   
   <p> I have written prose treatises on the constitution of the Universe and contributions
      in
      several comic papers. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I am an orator and a demagogue (I prefer the name demagogue for myself), I have
      delivered speeches on behalf of freethought &amp; democracy. I have gone, a Saxon,
      among the embittered children of Erin,<sup><a href="#syr.00019_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> and they will not
      report unfavourably of me. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Nor am I less thine equal on account of my years. I hold that youth has its own high
      wisdom, that it is fully as wise as age. For youth can be easiest touched &amp;
      taught &amp; won &amp; converted. 
   </p>
   
   <p> 4 </p>
   
   <p> On externals. </p>
   
   <p> Here I have recently come as a clerk in a government office. But meanwhile I
      secretly prepare myself for the task of aiding this people to reject the yoke of my
      own (I do not mean by bloodshed.) This though wilt surely deem a not unworthy
      object. Yet for its better advancement I have to play the part of a genteel
      citizen,—part repugnant! Such am I known, a respectable, good young man, with
      perhaps a taste for rhyme, a radical too, and tainted, alas! with some slight touch
      of freethought! 
   </p>
   
   <p> Yet to no two persons am I known quite the same, and there is not one who has seen
      one tenth part of what I am showing thee. (For I have not succeeded in publishing
      aught yet, though even now I am trying.) 
   </p>
   
   <p> Here too my fate of unfortunate love has followed me still, for thou art an ocean
      away. Now if thou wilt summon me, I will take courage and leave all I have, although
      without a penny I reach thy side (for I am not rich). But without thy word I dare
      not 
      forestal
      
       the course of events. Nor dare I summon thee here, for it is my place to
      go to thee. And if it were possible, I know  thou wouldst come. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Yet it shall come to pass somehow, soon or late. I must behold thee. And not so much
      to listen or talk, as to grasp thine own warm strong right hand, and take a long
      look down thine eyes!

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="syr.00019_n1">1. Discussing Upward's letter
      with his disciple Horace Traubel, Whitman (referencing Bram Stoker's letter of
      ) commented: "I have feelings
      about it but no conclusions: it's so youthful, so green, so little, so big, so
      spontaneous, so stagy, so bulging with vanity, so crowded with affection, I can
      only listen to it, read it, like it as if I was eating something I was sure I
      liked and wondered if I liked, both. Do you see something in the letter that
      makes you think of Stoker? The same impertinence, and pertinence, too? the same
      crude boy confidence, the same mix-up of instincts, magnetisms, revolts? In both
      cases there's the curious, beautiful self-deception of youth: Stoker, this boy:
      it's the same: they thought they were writing to me: so they were, incidentally:
      but they were really writing more definitely to themselves. I could not but
      warmly respond to that which is actually personal: I do it with my whole
      heart."<a href="#r1">[back]
