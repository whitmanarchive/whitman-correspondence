   <p>I have just telegraphed to you that Andrew was dead.<sup><a href="#loc.00428_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Poor boy he died much eaiser than one would have supposed. I do hope to God you will come on. I have been with
      him, Mary, Mother Mat and I, almost all the time since you left. Mary and I watched
      last night. He has been dying ever since Wednesday morning—full 24 hours—Poor Nancy,
      she takes it woful hard &nbsp;Mary has acted like the best of women &nbsp;It is very affecting to see Nancy and
      the children &nbsp;Mattie did everything that she possibly could<sup><a href="#loc.00428_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &nbsp;She watched with us till near 3oclk this morning &nbsp;Andrew was very desirous of having
      us all around him when he died. The poor boy seemed to think that that would take
      nearly all the horror of it away. If you will come on I will try and give you the
      passage money. Mother and the rest take it very hard. I hope to get an answer by telegraph.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00428_n100">1. Jeff and Walt did not
      correspond in November 1863 because the poet was home for a visit from November
      2 until December 1. Knowing that Andrew was near death, Walt attempted to
      bolster the family before the impending crisis. When Andrew died two days after
      Walt returned to Washington, new conflicts created even greater tension in the
      Whitman household.The worst of these conflicts resulted from the mental
      disorders of Jesse, the oldest Whitman brother. The genesis of Jesse's
      illness is not clear. One account is that he injured his head in a fall from
      a ship's mast, another that he was beaten on the head by thugs using brass
      knuckles (see Katherine Molinoff, <em>Some Notes on Whitman's
         Family</em>, Monographs on Unpublished Whitman Material, no. 2
      [Brooklyn: Comet Press, 1941], 19–22). Jeff, however, suggests that
      Jesse suffered from syphilis. For much of 1863 Jesse enjoyed good relations
      with the Jefferson Whitman family: he played amicably with Hattie and rocked
      Jessie in her cradle (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <em>Civil War
         Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke
      University Press, 1975], 91; Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman,
      August 31, 1863 [Trent Collection, William R. Perkins Library, Duke
      University]). But on December 4, in reaction to Andrew's death, Jesse
      exhibited a vicious outburst of temper that convinced Jeff that his eldest
      brother should be committed. Mother Whitman persuaded Walt that she could
      still care for Jesse, so no immediate action was taken (Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman to Walt Whitman, December 25, 1863 [Trent]). Jesse's condition must
      have deteriorated, however, for Walt committed him to King's County Lunatic
      Asylum on December 5, 1864, where he remained until his death on March 21,
      1870.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00428_n3">3. According to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman, Mattie remained at Andrew's side the day before he died "nearly
      all day [and] only came home to nurse the baby...martha was there till late
      &nbsp;then she came home and mary and Jeffy staid all night...they had to fan him all
      night and bathe him in brandy...when she [Nancy] came out in the morning she
      brought such a smell that Jeffy got sick" (letter to Walt Whitman, December 4,
      1863 [Trent Collection, William R. Perkins Library, Duke University]).<a href="#r3">[back]
