   </p>
   
   
   <p>Let me send this to introduce a call from J. B. Marvin, a valued friend of mine<sup><a href="#upa.00017_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—a Yankee born &amp; bred—democratic, literary,
      married—now briefly visiting London on business. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I still continue here laid up, but working a very little. </p>
   
   
   <p>Your kind letters received, &amp; welcomed. I was indeed interested in the account of
      the
      closing days of your dear mother<sup><a href="#upa.00017_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—surely a calm &amp;
      beautiful death after a calm &amp; beautiful life. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Best love, dear friend, to you &amp; to your children. </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0259">1. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="upa.00017_n1">2. In a letter dated , Gilchrist referred to a pleasant visit
      with Marvin, who had gone to England on official business (see Whitman's  letter to John Burroughs). On
      , William Michael Rossetti
      described to Walt Whitman a dinner he gave for Marvin which was attended by the
      following "<em>good Whitmanites</em>": Gilchrist; Joseph Knight,
      editor of the London <em>Sunday Times</em>; Justin McCarthy, a
      novelist and writer for the London <em>Daily News</em>; Edmund
      Gosse; and Rossetti's father-in-law, Ford Madox Brown.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="upa.00017_n3">4. Fearful after reading a printed account in
      which Conway reported that Walt Whitman had given up hope of recovery, on , Gilchrist implored: "<em>Dont give up that hope</em>, for the sake of those that so
      tenderly passionately love you." She promised to come to America as soon as
      Percy was married. Meanwhile, on October 19, 1875, Gilchrist had written to
      Burroughs to inform him that Walt Whitman's English admirers were preparing
      "some tangible embodiment however inadequate" to relieve the poet's financial
      needs (Boston Public Library; Clifton Joseph Furness, <em>Walt
         Whitman's Workshop</em> 1928, 244).<a href="#r4">[back]
