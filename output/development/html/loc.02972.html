      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I hoped I should be able to send you good news to-day; but instead I have to tell
      you
      that William<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> has had two epileptic attacks; one at 8.30 this A.
      M. &amp; one at 10.30 Now, at 3 P.M., he is asleep &amp; I hope may wake up better. It is
      very
      cruel to have him suffer so.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With love—
      <br></br>N. O'C.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
