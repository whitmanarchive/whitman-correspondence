      address: T W H Rolleston | Lange Strasse 29 | Dresden | Saxony. It is

   <p id="duk.00760_n2">2. Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was one of Professor Edward Dowden's students, a poet,
      biographer of Lessing, and historian of Irish myth and legends (<em>Whitman and Rolleston—A Correspondence</em>, ed. Horst
      Frenz [Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1951], 7). The
      correspondence between the two men began in 1879 (see Rolleston's letters in the
      John Rylands Library, Manchester, England), but the poet's replies (at least
      six) are missing. On , Rolleston
      sent Whitman a copy of his translation of Epictetus which he had printed at his
      own expense. The pamphlet is now in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.
      In the following year the <em>Enchiridion</em> of Epictetus was
      published in London by Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co. In his copy, also in the
      Feinberg Collection, Whitman wrote in 1886 or 1888: "Have had this little Vol.
      at hand or in my hand often all these years." The markings in three different
      colors testify to the fact that Whitman perused the book.<a href="#r2">[back]

      Rolleston on November 9 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Feinberg
