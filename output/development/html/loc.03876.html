   <p>Well friends all, here I am yet (surely but rather slowly going down hill) not so
      much very different from of old, but <u>more</u>
      <u>so</u>—more lame &amp; helpless in body, dimmer in sight
      &amp; harder in hearing—yet in pretty good spirits—warm &amp; wet
      weather here, &amp; lots of it—stand it yet here, thro' the summer mostly
      because I have to &amp; <u>can't help it</u>, but it is very oppressive &amp; stale here much
      of the time—but it might be much much worse, &amp; I get along—Mrs.
      D<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r2">2</a></sup> and Ed Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r3">3</a></sup> (my nurse) are good
      &amp; so far I get along fairly with appetite, grub &amp; sleep wh' of course make
      the foundation of all—
   </p>
   
   <p>—Herbert<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r4">4</a></sup> comes over quite frequently, &amp; is well &amp;
      I guess doing well (I hear of you all by him—otherwise you might as well be at
      the antipodes)—sickness &amp; death are all around me here, &amp; on the
      houses each side—I sit in the big chair all day &amp; pass away the time as
      well as I can—
   </p>
   
   <p>—Dr B<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r5">5</a></sup> is still in Canada—is well—I hear from
      him often—I had a letter from Ruth<sup><a href="#n1060" id="r6">6</a></sup> enclosed, (tho' I
      suppose she has written to you)—I send my love to Harry<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r7">7</a></sup>—have not heard from or seen him in a long time—Love to you &amp;
      George<sup><a href="#n0852" id="r8">8</a></sup> and to Ed<sup><a href="#n0589" id="r9">9</a></sup> &amp; Deb<sup><a href="#n0844" id="r10">10</a></sup> &amp; Van<sup><a href="#n0883" id="r11">11</a></sup> &amp; young Geo &amp; to Jo<sup><a href="#n4125" id="r12">12</a></sup>—not forgetting the children—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).

   <p id="n4319">3. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert

      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="n0590">7. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n0852">8. George Stafford was the father of
      Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's
      parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near
      Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. For more
      on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>" <em>Walt Whitman: An

      Harry Stafford. She married Joseph Browning. See <em>Daybooks and
