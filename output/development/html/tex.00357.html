   <p>I will just write you a line or two—it will be very short—but show you that I am still
      in the land of the living, &amp; have not forgotten you—My four months jaunt in this noble
      ample healthy Canada country is done (it has been a great success to me)—I have traveled
      several thousand miles—mostly on the Lakes &amp; St Lawrence, very comfortably &amp; I am
      now on my way back home to Camden, stopping here only a short time. I am feeling heartier
      physically than for years—Camden will be my permanent P O address—Love to you—
   </p>
