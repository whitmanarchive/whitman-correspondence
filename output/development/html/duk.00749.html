   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00749_n1">1. Whitman's dealings
      with Trübner &amp; Co. were handled through Josiah Child. See the
      letter from Whitman to Child of . On , Trübner sent
      Whitman $7.57 in payment for copies of <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>, and noted that 61 copies of that work were still on hand
      (Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On November 8 Whitman recorded that
      Trübner owed him $70 for ten sets and "also something due me for <em>Dem: Vistas</em>." On December 6 he received $47.55 from
      Trübner in payment for six sets and for fifteen (twelve according to
      the letter from Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of ) copies of <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>; the balance due was $28 for four sets and $17.02 for
      forty-six copies of <em>Democratic Vistas</em>.<br><br>
      Whitman received a payment from Trübner through Josiah Child on June 9,
      1879, and an order for books. See the letter from Whitman to Child of . Probably the payment amounted to
      $24.50, since in making a tally of the books in Trübner's possession as
      of June 27, he noted thirty-seven volumes (including thirty-six sent on June
      25 or 27) and forty-six copies of <em>Democratic Vistas</em>.
      On March 4, 1880, he received in payment $37.22; on July 22, 1880, $80.50,
      at which time he sent thirty-four volumes; on March 4, 1881, $105.37, at
      which time he sent an additional twenty volumes; and on December 8, 1881, he
      received $80.50. At that time the balance due was $14.43 for thirty-nine
      copies of <em>Democratic Vistas</em>. At a later date Whitman
      added to this entry, "all paid in full" (Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
