      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Breaking up a few weeks since, and for good, my New York stagnation—wandering since
      through camp and battle scenes—I fetch up here in harsh and superb plight—wretchedly
      poor, excellent well, (my only torment, family matters,)—realizing at last that it
      is necessary for me to fall for the time in the wise old way, to push my fortune,
      to be brazen, and get employment, and have an income—determined to do it, (at any
      rate until I get out of horrible sloughs) I write you, asking you as follows:
   </p>
   
   <p>I design to apply personally direct at headquarters, for some place. I would apply
      on literary grounds, not political.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish you would write for me something like the enclosed form of letter, that I can
      present, opening my interview with the great man. I wish you to write two copies—put
      the one in an envelope directed to Mr. Seward, Secretary of State—and the other in
      an envelope directed to Mr. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury—and enclose both envelopes
      in the one I send herewith so that I can use either one or the other. I wish you also
      to send me a note of introduction to Charles Sumner.<sup><a href="#har.00050_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>It is pretty certain that, armed in that way, I shall conquer my object. Answer me
      by next mail, for I am waiting here like ship waiting for the welcome breath of the
      wind.
   </p>
   
   <p>Indeed yours, &amp;c</p>
