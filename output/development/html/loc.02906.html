   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Roden Noel (1834–1894) was an
      English poet. Noel came from an aristocratic English family, and in his youth
      developed socialist sympathies. He was a close friend of the poet and
      influential critic Robert Buchanan, and it may have been through Buchanan that
      Noel first encountered <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In 1871 (the same
      year that he first wrote to Whitman). Noel published an essay entitled "A Study
      of Walt Whitman" in <em>The Dark Blue</em> (Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in England</em> [Ithaca, NY: Cornell University
      Press, 1934], 147–149).
