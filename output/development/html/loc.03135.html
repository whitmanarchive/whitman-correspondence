   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of 13th has reached me. Thanks to you—&amp; thanks &amp; best remembrances to your wife—for the kind
      invitation in it.
      I shall probably accept it for a few days, as I want to visit Washington soon as I
      am well enough.
      I should have made my visit the current week, but one of my bad spells has intervened—will
      write 
      
      
      to you
      before I come—I still linger along here in the same tedious baffling way—still hope
      to get well—but still
      <u>don't</u> get well.
      
   </p>

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Joseph B. Marvin, a friend and
      an admirer of Whitman's poetry, was from 1866 to 1867 the co-editor of the <em>Radical</em>. He was then appointed as a clerk in the Treasury
      Department in Washington, on behalf of which he took a trip to London in the
      late fall of 1875. On , Whitman
      wrote a letter to William Michael Rossetti to announce a visit from Marvin.
      Rossetti gave a dinner for Marvin, which was attended by the following "good
      Whitmanites": Anne Gilchrist; Joseph Knight, editor of the London <em>Sunday Times</em>; Justin McCarthy, a novelist and writer for
      the London <em>Daily News</em>; Edmund Gosse; and Rossetti's
      father-in-law, Ford Madox
      Brown.
