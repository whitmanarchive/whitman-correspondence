      <br></br>Dear Madam,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I though[t] I would send you a copy, (see other side)<sup><a href="#prc.00095_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> of a
      note I have just forwarded to the <em>Herald</em>.
   </p>  
   
   <p>I also enclose a slip better describing "the situation",<sup><a href="#prc.00095_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      (which I wish my friends to bear in mind more than they do.)
   </p>
   
   <p>I remain about the same. 
      Rec'd
      
       your kind note, with piece. Hope I may yet meet you personally—&amp;
      your brother, (whom I have heard of lately by my friend John Burroughs.)
   </p>
   
   <p>I also send you a newspaper same mail with this.</p>
