      <br></br>Dear friends,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose the MS. of "Passage to India" came safe, last week—to be put in type
      as requested—with p. o. order for $10—I write now merely to ask you
      to <em>read the proof carefully by copy</em>—<em>correct carefully</em>—&amp; then send me <em>two
         proofs</em>—put it through as soon as convenient.
   </p>

   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I have a piece in next Galaxy<sup><a href="#har.00036_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—about three or four sticks full—about Spring—I wish
      you would just copy it in your paper &amp; send me 10 copies—
   </p>
