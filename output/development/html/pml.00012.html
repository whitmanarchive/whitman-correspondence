      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letters were both received, &amp; were indeed welcome. Don't mind my not answering
      them promptly, for you know what a wretch I am about such things. But you must write
      just as often as you conveniently can. Tell me all about your folks, especially the
      girls, &amp; about Mr Arnold<sup><a href="#pml.00012_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—of course you won't forget Arthur,<sup><a href="#pml.00012_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; always when you write to him send him my love. Tell me about Mrs Urner<sup><a href="#pml.00012_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; the dear little rogues. Tell Mrs Black<sup><a href="#pml.00012_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> she ought to be here hospital matron—only it is a harder pull than folks anticipate.
      You wrote about Emma, her thinking she might &amp; ought to come as nurse for the soldiers—dear
      girl, I know it would be a blessed thing for the men to have her loving spirit &amp; hand,
      &amp; whoever of the poor fellows had them would indeed feel it so. But, my darling, it
      is a dreadful thing—you dont know these wounds, sicknesses &amp;c—the sad condition in
      which many of the men are brought here, &amp; remain for days, sometimes the wounds full
      of crawling corruption &amp;c—Down in the field hospitals in front they have no proper
      care &amp; attention, &amp; after a battle go for many days unattended to—
   </p>
   
   <p>Abby, I think often about you, &amp; the pleasant days, the visits I used to pay you &amp;
      how good it was always to be made so welcome. O I wish I could come in this afternoon,
      &amp; have a good tea with you, &amp; have three or four hours of mutual comfort &amp; talk, &amp;
      be all of us together again. Is Helen home, &amp; well? And what is she doing now? And
      you, my dear friend, how sorry I am to hear that your health is not rugged—but, dear
      Abby, you must not dwell on anticipations of the worst. (But I know that is not your
      nature, or did not use to be.) O I hope this will find you feeling quite well, &amp; in
      good spirits—I feel so well myself—I will have to come &amp; see you I think—I am so fat,
      out considerable in the open air, &amp; all red &amp; tanned worse than ever. You see therefore
      that my life amid these sad &amp; unhealthy hospitals has not yet told upon me, for I
      am this fall running over with health, so I feel [as] if I ought to go on that account
      [working] among all the sick &amp; deficient [who are deprived of] it—&amp; O how gladly I
      would [bestow upon you a] liberal share, dear Abby, [if such a]<sup><a href="#pml.00012_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> thing were possible.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am continually moving around among the hospitals. One I go to oftenest the last
      three months is Armory Square, as it is large, generally full of the worst wounds
      &amp; sicknesses, &amp; is one of the least visited—to this, or some one, I never miss a day
      or evening. I am enabled to give the men something—add perhaps some trifle to their
      supper all round. Then there are always special cases, needing something special.
      Above all the poor boys welcome magnetic friendship, personality (some are so fervent,
      so hungering for this)—poor fellows, how young they are, lying there with their pale
      faces, &amp; that mute look in the eyes. O how one gets to love them, often, particular
      cases, so suffering, so good, so manly &amp; affectionate—Abby, you would all smile to
      see me among them—many of them like children, ceremony is mostly discarded—they suffer
      &amp; get exhausted &amp; so weary—lots of them have grown to expect as I leave at night that
      we should kiss each other, sometimes quite a number, I have to go round—poor boys,
      there is little petting in a soldier's life in the field, but, Abby, I know what is
      in their hearts, always waiting, though they may be unconscious of it themselves—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have a place where I buy very nice home-made biscuits, sweet crackers &amp;c—Among others,
      one of my ways is to get a good lot of these &amp; for supper go through a couple of wards
      &amp; give a portion to each man—next evening two wards more, &amp; so on—then each marked
      case needs something to itself—I spend my evenings altogether at the hospitals—my
      day, often. I give little gifts of money in small sums, which I am enabled to do.
      All sorts of things indeed, food, clothing, letter-stamps (I write lots of letters),
      now &amp; then a good pair of crutches &amp;c &amp;c. Then I read to the boys—the whole ward that
      can walk gathers around me &amp; listens—
   </p>
   
   <p>All this I tell you, my dear, because I know it will interest you. I like Washington
      very well (did you see my last letter in N Y Times of Oct 4, Sunday?)<sup><a href="#pml.00012_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup> I have three or four hours work every day copying &amp; in writing letters for the press,
      &amp;c., make enough to pay my way—live in an unexpensive manner any how—I like the mission I am on here, &amp; as it is deeply holding me I shall
      continue—
   </p>
   
   <p>October 5
      Well, Abby, I guess I will send you letter enough—I ought to have finished &amp; sent
      off the letter last Sunday, when it was written—I have been pretty busy—we are having
      new arrivals of wounded &amp; sick now all the time—some very bad cases—Abby, should you
      come across any one who feels to help, contribute to the men through me, write me.
      (I may then send word some purchases I should find acceptable for the men)—but this
      only if it happens to come in that you know or meet any one, perfectly convenient—
   </p>
   
   <p>Abby, I have found some good friends here, a few, but true as steel—W D O'Connor &amp;
      wife, above all. He is a clerk in Treasury—she is a Yankee girl—then C W Eldridge<sup><a href="#pml.00012_n8" id="r7">7</a></sup> in paymaster's department. He is a Boston boy too—their friendship has been unswerving.
   </p>
   
   <p>In the hospitals among these American young men, I could not describe to you what
      mutual attachments &amp; how passing deep &amp; tender these boys—some have died, but the
      love for them lives as long as I draw breath—those soldiers know how to love too when
      once they have the right person &amp; the right love offered them. It is wonderful. You
      see I am running off into the clouds—but this is my element—
   </p>
   
   <p>Abby, I am writing this note this afternoon in Major Hapgood's office—he is away sick—I
      am here a good deal of the time alone—it is a dark rainy afternoon—we don't know what
      is going on down in front, whether Meade is getting the worst of it, or not<sup><a href="#pml.00012_n9" id="r8">8</a></sup>—(but the result of the big elections cheers us)<sup><a href="#pml.00012_n10" id="r9">9</a></sup>—I believe fully in Lincoln—few know the rocks &amp; quicksands he has to steer through.
      I enclose you a note Mrs O'Connor handed me to send to you, written I suppose upon
      impulse—she is a noble Massachusetts woman, is not very rugged in health—I am there
      very much—her husband &amp; I are great friends too—Well I will close—the rain is pouring,
      the sky leaden—it is between 2 &amp; 3—I am going to get some dinner &amp; then to hospital—good
      by, dear friends, &amp; I send my love to all—

      <br></br>Walt Whitman

<div class="editorial_notes">
   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Abby H. Price
      (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
      husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
      children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
      age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
      were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
      Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for
      the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother in <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 (1908): 163–169. In a letter to Ellen M.
      O'Connor from , Whitman declared
      with emphasis, "<em>they are all friends</em>, to prize and love
      deeply."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pml.00012_n2">1. John Arnold lived with
      his daughter's family in the same house as the Price family. Helen Price, Abby's
      daughter, described Arnold as "a Swedenborgian," with whom Whitman frequently
      argued without "the slightest irritation between them" (Bucke,
      26–27).<a href="#r1">[back]
