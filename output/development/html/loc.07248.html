   <p>The fair still goes on. I hear in the hall outside my door the steady tramp and
      chatter of some dozens of men and women. Weather not so good rainy last evening and
      cloudy and cold this morning. The Inspector is to be here in a day or two (perhaps
      today) then things will be livelier than ever—he calls the roll when he comes
      this time, i.e. sees every patient individually. Nothing new in re meter,<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> we are
      expecting a man from Montreal every day who will probably go in with us. If he decides
       to do so we
      shall be in a position to move. At present we need a little capital and cannot get
      on without it.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all well and hearty, Mrs B.<sup><a href="#n4273" id="r3">3</a></sup> took all the children to the
      fair yesterday, they had quite a time—for my part I quit going to fairs some
      years ago.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am reading Past &amp; Present<sup><a href="#n6134" id="r4">4</a></sup>— funny, isn't it, to see a man of the 19th
      century who thinks better of the monastic feudal life of 12th century than of the
      industrial life of today? And by his own showing they must have been a bad lot those
      monks and knights—and see Froude's<sup><a href="#loc.07242_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> Henry VIII
      especially as to the monks!
   </p>
   
   <p>I<sup><a href="#loc.07248_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> hope you are having at least a <u>tolerable</u> time of it &amp;
      are getting on with the <u>books</u><sup><a href="#loc.07244_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup>.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07230_n2">2. Bucke and his brother-in-law
      William John Gurd were designing a gas and fluid meter to be patented in Canada
      and sold in England.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n4273">3. Jessie Maria Gurd (1839–1926)
      grew up in Mooretown, Upper Canada. She was the daughter of William Gurd, an 
      army officer from Ireland. Jessie married Richard Maurice Bucke in 1865. The couple
      had eight children.<a href="#r3">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07242_n2">5. James Anthony Froude
      (1818–1894) was an English historian, biographer, and editor of <em>Fraser's Magazine</em>. Froude was also a close friend and
      literary executor to Thomas Carlyle, after whose death Froude published a
      biography entitled <em>Life of Carlyle</em>, which described
      Carlyle's intellectual accomplishments as well as his personal failings, in
      particular his unhappy relationship with his wife, Jane Welsh. Froude had
      previously published Jane's writings in <em>Letters and Memorials
         of Jane Welsh Carlyle</em> in 1883 to much protest from Carlyle's surviving
      family, and his biography of Carlyle emphasized his conflicted marriage for
      contemporary readers. For more on Froude, see Ciarán Brady, <em>James Anthony Froude: An Intellectual Biography of a Victorian
         Prophet</em> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013).<a href="#r5">[back]
