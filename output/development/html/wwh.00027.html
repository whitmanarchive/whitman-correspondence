   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William J. Sewell (1835â€“1901)
      was a politician, merchant, and military general who came to the U.S. from
      Ireland when he was a boy. During the Civil War, Sewell served in the Union
      Army, and was awarded a Medal of Honor after leading a charge at
      Chancellorsville. After the war, Sewell was affiliated with several railroads,
      including the Camden and Atlantic Railroad Company and the West Jersey Railroad
      Company. He was New Jersey state senator from 1872 to 1881 and a Republican
      representative to the U.S. Senate from 1881 to 1887 and 1895 until his death in
      1901.
