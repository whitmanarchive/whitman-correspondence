   <p>I am here yet, much the same, to say it summarily, fairly jolly—go out now
      sometimes in a wheel chair,<sup><a href="#loc.03012_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> exceptionally for an hour or two to the river shore when
      I feel like it—have a good strong young Canadian (Ed Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r6">6</a></sup>) for my helper

         mid-day</em>—&amp; am probably getting along better than you all might
      suppose—fortunately my right &amp; left arms are left me in good strength
      &amp; volition, (in the terrible wreck &amp; almost helplessness of the rest of the

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="tex.00477_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Edw'd Carpenter | Millthorpe | near Chesterfield | England. It is postmarked:

   <p id="med.00873_n1">2.  Isabella Ford
      (1855–1924) was an English feminist, socialist, and writer. Elizabeth
      (Bessie) Ford was her sister. Both were introduced to Whitman's writings by
      Carpenter, and they quickly became admirers of the aged poet. The Ford sisters
      also helped form the Leeds Women's Suffrage Society. In 1875, Isabella Ford met Carpenter,
      who
      introduced her to socialism; they joined The Fabian Society in 1883.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="tex.00477_n2">4. Carpenter sent the
      birthday gift of $194.95 (£40) on 
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.56.html">Sunday, June 2, 1889</a>). On Carpenter's letter Whitman wrote: "Seems to
      me one of the leading best missives I ever had—goes to the heart." Traubel
      included the letter in <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1889), 54.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03012_n1">5. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy of .<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">6. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="tex.00477_n3">7. There is no extant letter
      from Whitman to Carpenter reporting the proceedings of the 70th birthday dinner.
      For similar letters regarding the dinner, see the poet's  letter to William Sloane Kennedy and his  letter to Richard Maurice
      Bucke. See also Whitman's  letter to

   <p id="n0262">8. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

      young man who Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's parents, George and
      Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near Kirkwood, New
      Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. For more on Whitman and
      the Staffords, see David G. Miller, "Stafford, George and Susan M." <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, eds. J.R. LeMaster and

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4188">10. Whitman often referred to <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888) as his "big book." With
      the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made the presswork and binding decisions,
      and Frederick Oldach bound the volume, which included a profile photo of the
      poet on the title page. Philadelphia publisher David McKay published the book in
      December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
