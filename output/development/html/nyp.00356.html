   <p>Am feeling better than during Nov. and first part of Dec—strength better than for a long time—rec'd the <em>Springfield Rep</em>[<em>ublican</em>]<sup><a href="#nyp.00356_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> this morning—(is it from you or Ch[arley]?)<sup><a href="#nyp.00356_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—That ¶ in the T[ribune]<sup><a href="#nyp.00356_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> was the most flourishing puff yet given me—&amp; from <em>them!</em>—A leaden, heavy day here, with sulky rain 
      &amp; some snow &amp; sleet—I have to stay in, but am feeling comfortable.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00356_n1">1. 
      This letter's envelope bears the address, "Mrs. E. M. O'Connor | 1015 O
      street, near 11th N. W. | Washington D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Jan |
      8 | N.J.; Carrier | 9 | Jan | 8 AM."<br><br>
      In light of the references to the two newspapers, discussed in the notes
      below, the year seems reasonably certain. <a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00356_n2">2. Perhaps the issue of
      December 29, 1874, in which a correspondent expressed surprise that Whitman was
      not included in Emerson's <em>Parnassus</em>, and noted the New
      York <em>Tribune</em>'s change in attitude; see the notes to
      Whitman's  letter to Whitelaw
      Reid.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00356_n3">3. Whitman refers here to
      Charles Eldridge.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00356_n4">4. This is probably a
      reference to a paragraph in the New York <em>Tribune</em> on
      December 26, 1874, which commented on Whitman's services during the Civil War,
      and concluded: "…we need not share or contest the opinion of his poetry
      held by Mr. Tennyson and Mr. Emerson, to hope that he may soon recover and that
      he may enjoy the peaceful age he has earned." In the judgment of Whitman and his
      friends, the <em>Tribune</em> had been hostile chiefly because of
      the influence of Bayard Taylor.<a href="#r4">[back]
