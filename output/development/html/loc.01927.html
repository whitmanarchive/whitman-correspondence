   <p></span><span class="handshift">The Agathanian Club will shortly
      begin the issue of original publications, and reprints of rare, curious and old
      American, English, French and Latin books. The typography will be that of the
      Bradstreet Press, and will equal, if not excel, the best
      productions of the Shakspere, Chiswick, and Didot Presses.
   </p>
   
   <p>The objects in view are:</p>
   
   
   <p>1. To enable persons possessed of bibliophilogical tastes to procure at a
      moderate price, valuable works, produced in the highest style of art, with all
      possible exactness of text, and of which only a very small number of copies will
      be printed.
   </p>
   
   <p>2. To stimulate the development of the typographical art in this country to its
      utmost limit of perfection.
   </p>
   
   <p>One hundred and twenty copies only of each work will be published; one hundred of
      which will be for sale, and the remainder for private distribution. The paper used will be
      of the same quality as that on which this announcement is printed; the size
      medium octavo.
   </p>
   
   <p>When necessary, notes for the purpose of elucidating the text will be furnished,
      in the form of an appendix, by accomplished scholars.
   </p>
   
   <p>In reprinting old books, the style of the original as regards type and general
      appearance, will be preserved, so far as may be compatible with correctness and
      true aesthetic principles. Head and tail pieces, initial letters, woodcuts and
      other engravings, will invariably be reproduced in fac–simile.
   </p>
   
   <p>The first issue will be a reprint of an exceedingly rare and interesting book,
      entitled, "Advice to the Officers of the British Army," the authorship of which
      is generally attributed to Captain Grose, a distinguished
      literary gentleman of the last century. As a clever piece of satire, this work
      has probably never been equaled. The precepts it contains are fully as
      applicable to armies of the present day as to the British army of nearly a
      hundred years ago. A satirical woodcut, supposed to represent Sir Henry
      Clinton, General Burgoyne, Lord Cornwallis and others, will be given in fac–simile of the
      original. The notes and introduction to this work will be written by a
      well–known author. It will be published on or about the fifteenth of
      February. Subscribers will have preference in being supplied, according to the
      order in which their subscriptions are made. Those in excess of the
      first hundred will be placed upon the list for the second work to be issued,
      should they so desire.
   </p>
   
   <p>The price will be Five Dollars, paper; Six Dollars, extra cloth, top edge gilt.
      Subscriptions will be received by Messrs. J. M. Bradstreet &amp; Son, of the
      Bradstreet Press, 18 Beekman Street, New York, and by Messrs. John Penington &amp; Son, 127 S. 7th Street,
      Philadelphia. The prices of future publications will be duly announced. They
      will vary according to the size and illustrations of each volume.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Abraham Simpson, while working for J. M.
      Bradstreet &amp; Son, had supervised the binding of <em>Drum-Taps</em> (see Walt Whitman's , letter to Peter Eckler). Simpson wrote on , that he was going into business for
      himself: "Hearing you are writing another book, [I] would like to print and
      publish it for you and will give you better advantages than any other publishing
      house. . . . One of my reasons for securing your friendship is my appreciation
      for you as a man, with knowing your life has been devoted to help among those
      most in need of your assistance." On ,
      Simpson informed Walt Whitman that "we have established a Ptg &amp; Publishing
      House." But, in his , letter, he
      advised Walt Whitman that after consultation "with several eminent literary men,
      . . . though we are favorably impressed, . . . we deem it injudicious to commit
      ourselves to its publication at the present time."
