   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years, and he speaks often in his letters of their daughter Jean, by nickname
      "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break in late
      1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated black citizens,
      Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence between Whitman and
      Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For
      more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see also Dashae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

      D. Kummings, ed., (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="nyp.00567_n2">3. In a lengthy letter on
      , Ellen M. O'Connor had informed
      Whitman that her husband had secretly gone to Maine in order to try the method
      of Dr. Kinnear for his illness. She sent "a package of letters belonging to you
      . . . the Rossetti correspondence, &amp; as a part of history valuable."<a href="#r3">[back]
