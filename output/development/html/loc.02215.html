   </p>
   
   <p>The 22d of February (Washington's Birthday) being the <u>seventieth</u> anniversary of the birth of Mr. James Russell Lowell,<sup><a href="#n3105" id="r1">1</a></sup> it is our
      intention to publish on that date a number of <u>The Critic</u>
      consisting mainly of personal estimates of, and greetings to, the distinguished
      poet, satirist and statesman.
   </p>
   
   <p>Should you care to make the tribute a
      more memorable one by adding your congratulations to those of the other distinguished
      men and women whose names will appear in this special number, we should esteem it
      a
      privilege &amp; make room for as many words—or as few—as you may care to
      write.
   </p>
   
   <p>We need hardly add that Mr. Lowell knows nothing of the intended compliment, which
      we trust
      will surprise as much as it must please him.
   </p>
   
   <p>Whatever you may send should reach us by Feb. 19.</p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Very sincerely yours,
      <br></br>Joseph B. Gilder

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3105">1. James Russell Lowell
      (1819–1891) was an American critic, poet and editor of <em>The Atlantic</em>. One Whitman's famous poetic contemporaries, Lowell was
      committed to conventional poetic form, which was clearly at odds with Whitman's
      more experimental form. Still, as editor of the <em>Atlantic
         Monthly</em>, he published Whitman's "Bardic Symbols," probably at Ralph
      Waldo Emerson's suggestion. Lowell later wrote a tribute to Abraham Lincoln
      titled "Commemoration Ode," which has often, since its publication, been
      contrasted with Whitman's own tribute, "O Captain! My Captain!" For further
      information on Whitman's views of Lowell, See William A. Pannapacker, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_198.html">Lowell, James Russell (1819–1891)</a>," <em>Walt
