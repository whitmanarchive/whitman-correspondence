      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Drop me a line where &amp; how you are, &amp; what your plans are for the fall.</p>
   
   
   <p>We are just back from Roxbury where we went in July. We are all pretty well. I 
      rec'd
      
      
      
      Dr Buckes
      
       book &amp; thank you for it. I had already purchased &amp; read it. I
      cannot say that I care  much for what 
      Dr
      
       Bucke has to say; he gives me no new hint or idea. 
      Wm O'Connors
      
       letter is a treat, with a little too much seasoning. If 
      W<u>m</u>
      
       would only practice a little more self-denial, he would be much more
      effective. He <u>could</u> write so that his critics could not
      laugh at him.
   </p>
   
   <p>The review of the book in the <u>Tribune</u>, was
      by a woman—a Miss H—(I forget her name) regularly  employed upon the paper. The
      latter part of June Gilder &amp; I went to Concord &amp; spent a couple of days there,
      called on 
      Mrs
      
       Emerson, liked her much, supped &amp; breakfasted with Sanborn &amp; had
      a pleasant time. Young 
      Dr
      
       Emerson, seems a worthy son of his father. I liked him much.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If we ever get another girl in this house &amp; the kitchen machinery running
      smoothly again, I shall come for you &amp; take no denial. I think it would  lengthen my days
      to see you once more.
   </p>
