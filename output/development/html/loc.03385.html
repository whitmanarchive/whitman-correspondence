   </p>
   
   <p>
      I have received and heartily thank you for the papers you have sent and the welcome
      copy of "Good bye! My Fancy"<sup><a href="#xxx.00459" id="r2">2</a></sup>.
      I have not wanted to bother you during your severe illness, hence my silence. But
      we have followed with interest any information 
      about you especially the facsimile letter which Dr. Johnston of Bolton<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r3">3</a></sup> was kind enough to send me and the article in a late
      "Review of Reviews" with a sketch of your house and a little chit chat on your political
      opinions (I have much the same opinions
      myself of late years, but that is not surprising for they are simple deductions from
      the spiritual principle
      of the spirit of "Leaves of Grass.") I gave a lecture on "Walt Whitman, the Poet of
      Democracy" to an audience of 3 or 400 people at a 
      Sunday night meeting of the Australian Secular Association and was very well received.
      The subject was evidently 
      unfamliar but its reception gave me great hopes that it will not be so long in that
      quarter anyway. I made the acquaintance of
      another Whitman enthusiast at the meeting, Mr. John Sutherland M.A., and I can assure
      you we have had some glorious evenings together
      since talking of you and with you. He tells me that he has only read L.ofG. once,
      but wants to read it no more.
      He doesn't remember the words particularly, but the
      new mental attitude to things he believes he has thoroughly absorbed, and the world
      is different and life different to him since.
      "Tom Touchstone" sent another disciple, Mr. Carr, to me and he is quite devoted. He
      was greatly pleased at
      a portrait I was able to give him. Mr. Sutherland &amp; Jim Hartigan want a copy of "Good
      bye my Fancy". Could
      you send price, please. Fred Woods would like one of those portraits where you appear
      with (as it were) storm tossed beard,
      your hat on, and a hearty, sea-captain-like look on you, and if it would not be too
      much trouble, with your name on it.
      He's a grand fellow Fred, and tossed as he was on seas of doubt &amp; deserts of the barrenest
      materialism,
      you have become a virtual religion to him as you have to more than him. Mr. Sutherland
      has translated Freiligrath's<sup><a href="#n0248" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      article on you (from Dr. Bucke's book). It is wonderful what misunderstandings are
      about concerning your poems of sex.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I do not fear, as you seem to do, that we shall separate from Britain. I advocated
      it once, nay started a society to
      bring it about, which I am glad to say soon died. For this change as for many others,
      I must thank you. I like to hear
      your ideas on Australians and would say much myself but that I don't want to bother
      you too much. We want a Walt Whitman here:
      ours is a democracy too with ever more hopeful prospects than yours but with great
      dangers ahead (especially social) and here 
      too the song of material interests drowns the other pieces in the chorus.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      We love you all, and greet you with sympathy in your illness and with growing hope
      for your speedy recognition by all 
      men as being as much their Walt as you are ours.

   <p id="n4102">3. John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_97.html">Johnston, Dr. John (d.1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0248">4. Ferdinand Freiligrath (1810–1876) was a German
      poet and translator and friend of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In his  letter to Rudolf Schmidt, Whitman
      wrote that Freiligrath "translates &amp; commends my poems." His review in the
      Augsburg <em>Allgemeinen Zeitung</em> on April 24, 1868 (reprinted
      in his <em>Gesammelte Dichtungen</em> [Stuttgart: G. J. Göschen,
      1871], 4:86–89), was among the first notices of Whitman's poetry on the
      continent. A translation of the article appeared in the <em>New
         Eclectic Magazine</em>, 2 (July 1868), 325–329; see also Gay Wilson
      Allen, <em>Walt Whitman Abroad</em> (Syracuse: Syracuse University
      Press, 1955), 3–7. A digital version is available in Walter Grünzweig's
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/german/introduction.html">Whitman in the German-Speaking Countries</a>," which collects several
      examples of German reception of Whitman's poetry. Freiligrath had promised his
      readers "some translated specimens of the poet's productions," not a complete
      translation. William D. O'Connor and Whitman were applying pressure. A
      sympathetic article on Whitman in the New York <em>Sontagsblatt</em> of November 1, 1868, mentioned Freiligrath's admiration
      for the American poet. A translation of this article, which Whitman had a
      Washington friend prepare, is now in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.<a href="#r4">[back]
