      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mattie is about the same—she has not failed so much within the last few days—indeed
      I do not know but that she feels a little better—but she is weaker—yet does not suffer
      so much &nbsp;If the weather should prove good I hope she may still gain again—yet the
      Dr gives no hope—if she can keep up till Walt gets well enough to come to see her
      I should rejoice
   </p>
   
   <p>I received your letter this morning dear Mother—I knew you would all feel badly—but
      as Mattie was failing so very rapidly I then thought she would not live even a day—I
      cannot say that Mattie worries much about the children—the fact is that she has been
      sick so long and suffered so much that I do not think she appreciates how near the
      end is
   </p>
   
   <p>If there is any change I will write immediately. Love to all</p>
