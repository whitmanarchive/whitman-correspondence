   <p>Ab't the same as usual—a rare egg &amp; Graham bread &amp; prunes &amp; coffee
      for my breakfast—I am pretty moderate in eating, &amp; w'd be <em>abstemious</em>, but I fancy a fairly efficient fortification in
      stomach helps keep at bay quite many of the wolfs &amp; wolflets of old fellows'
      physical (&amp; perhaps all fellows) attacks. I take no medicines at
      all—hardly any alcoholic drink—never beer—eat plain
      fare—never risk—the trick is to steer between that last mention'd need
      to keep the wolf away &amp; the benefit of very light food—eating, wh' is
      decided for an old fellow—

   <p>I enclose my latest pieces—(have not yet seen the Feb: <em>Century</em> but suppose the poemet is in it)<sup><a href="#loc.07753_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—have just been engaged to write some little bits for <em>Munyon's Illustrated World</em> (monthly Phila)—will send you when
      printed—$10 each, one paid<sup><a href="#loc.07753_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—So far have
      escaped the grip, (but I guess I have the am't of it in my physical brain already,
      &amp; have had two years)—Alys Smith<sup><a href="# uva.00553_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> comes
      regularly, does me good to see her—She is the handsomest, healthiest best
      balanced young woman in the world known to me—have quite many
      visitors—sold a big book yesterday—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07753_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. |
      Feb 3 | 8 PM | 90.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07753_n2">2. On February 3 he sent
      "The Commonplace" and "The Human Voice" (prose) as well as a paragraph "ab't
      common school teachers" to <em>Munyon's Illustrated
         World</em>—"$20 due me." The poem appeared in that magazine in manuscript
      facsimile in March, 1891, and "The Human Voice" (later entitled "The Perfect
      Human Voice") in October, 1890; see William Sloane Kennedy, <em>The Fight of a Book for the World</em> (1926), 271. "Unknown Names" became
      "A Twilight Song" when it was accepted on February 26 by <em>Century</em>, which printed it in May and paid Walt Whitman $25 (<em>The Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839-1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.07753_n3">3. "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf250r1">A Death-Bouquet</a>" became the last section of <em>Good-Bye My Fancy</em>, which was later reprinted in <em>Complete Prose Works</em> (1892). Though Whitman notes its appearance in
      the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in this letter, Floyd Stovall
      claims not to have found it there in his edition of the <em>Prose
         Works 1892</em>. See <em>The Collected Writings of Walt
         Whitman: Rpose Works 1892. Volume II, Collect and Other Prose</em>, ed.
      Floyd Stovall (New York: New York University Press, 1964), 671n.<a href="#r3">[back]
