      <br></br><br></br>My dear Johnston,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of yesterday rec'd. Every thing will suit me, just that way—would like to come
      during or before 
      the close of January—would like to have a room where I could have a fire, table, &amp;c.
      My nephew<sup><a href="#loc.02553_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; I when traveling always share the same room together &amp; the same bed, &amp; would like
      best to do so there. 
      I want to bring on a lot of my books, new edition, &amp; sell them, so I can raise a little
      money(—&amp; 
      that is what my young man is for.)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Fix the time to suit Waters &amp; yourself, that way.
      
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.02553_">1. The letter itself reads "Dec
      19/1875" but an editorial marking crosses out 1875 and suggests instead that the
      letter is dated 1876.<a href="#r1">[back]

      was hardly accurate since there is no evidence that Harry and he had taken a
