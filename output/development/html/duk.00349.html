      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We arrived here last night, and will leave for Knoxville in the course of an hour
      or two. I am very well indeed and we have had a very pleasant trip out this far. We
      staid in Louisville Ky. 4 days, boarding at a first rate Hotel, and I am trying to
      eat enough to last me for a week or two after I get to the front. I found my trunk
      up at Fort Schuyler all right the morning I left home. Everything seems to be quiet
      just now in this Department &nbsp;we are ordered to proceed to Knoxville by way of Chatanooga.
      I have not written to Walt since I left home but I shall write as soon as we get to
      our destination. Mother when you write &nbsp;direct to Knoxville and when you write to
      Walt tell him to not wait to get a letter from me, but to let me hear from him immediately.
   </p>
   
   <p>How are you all at home &nbsp;the baby you know was not well when I left, but I hope she
      is all right before now, &nbsp;When you write to Han tell her I shall write to her Soon,
      and if you hear from her tell me all about her in your next letter. I must stop now
      as it is about time for me to get ready to start. Kind regards to all
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00349_n100">1. After successfully
      defending Knoxville against General Longstreet's siege (November 17â€“29,
      1863), General Burnside transferred the Department of Ohio to General John G.
      Foster (December 11, 1863) and returned to his home in Rhode Island. The men of
      the Ninth Army Corps were sent home to their respective states for furloughs and
      re-enlistment. In January, 1864, George Whitman returned home on a thirty-day
      leave to Brooklyn, New York, where he re-enlisted. On February 25, 1864, he went
      back with his regiment to the Department of Ohio.<a href="#r1">[back]
