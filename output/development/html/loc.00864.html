      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Walt Whitman: 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>On the receipt of your favor of the 26th ult., I arranged with Captain Walton for
      the sending of a box to our dear and brave boys at the Danville Military Prison.<sup><a href="#loc.00864_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>And to-day I am having a box put up which will start tomorrow.</p>
   
   <p>Captain Wright does not think the boxes will ever reach our boys—but this shall not
      prevent my trying to get them things to keep the breath of life in them, and to cheer
      them up<sup><a href="#loc.00864_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>.
   </p>
   
   <p>Of the articles you enumerate, I omitted tobacco, fearing it could perfume and render the food impalatable.  I added dessicated vegetables in its' stead.</p>
   
   <p>It is about time you heard from the first box you sent. Have you?</p>
   
   <p>If the accounts in the papers are correct, we ought to have the boys back again before
      long.  I hope their turn for exchange will come first.
   </p>
   
   <p>Major Marsh has arrived back at the regiment again, after a short visit here.</p>
   
   <p>A letter from Capt. M. Ready just brings me word that they are in good spirits after
      the movement on the left.<sup><a href="#loc.00864_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Elliott F. Shepard, of the
      Fifty-first Regiment, informed George of his promotion on April 16, 1862 (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [Boston: Small,
      Maynard &amp; Company, 1906–96], 2:201). Whitman also suspected that
      Colonel Shepard was responsible for George's promotion to major in 1865.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00864_n2">1. Captain Charles W. Walton
      was a member of the Fifty-first Regiment, New York State Volunteers.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00864_n3">2. Lieutenant Colonel John G.
      Wright was commanding officer of the Fifty-first Regiment.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00864_n4">3. While Walt was with George
      after the battle of Fredericksburg in 1862, he noted in his diary that, among
      others, Fred B. McReady, then an orderly sergeant in George's regiment, "used me
      well" (Charles I. Glicksberg, <em>Walt Whitman and the Civil
         War</em> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1933], 70).
      McReady sent Whitman a lengthy account of the activities of the Fifty-first
      regiment from February 9 to April 29, 1864 (Berg Collection, New York Public
      Library). In the Brooklyn <em>Daily Union</em> of September 22,
      Whitman noted: "Fred. McReady I know to be as good a man as the war has received
      out of Brooklyn City" (Emory Holloway, ed., The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of
      Walt Whitman. [Garden City, New York: Doubleday, Page, 1921], 2:29). On May 6,
      1864, McReady was wounded in the hip.<a href="#r3">[back]
