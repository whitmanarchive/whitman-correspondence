   </p>
   
   
   <p>Feeling assured that any information of my doings and whereabouts will meet with only
      the kindest reception from you, I venture once [
      <span class="unclear">more?</span>]
       after [
      <span class="unclear">a?</span>]
       long silence, to address you.
   </p>
   
   <p>If any excuse be necessary, let my respect and [
      <span class="unclear">esteem?</span>]
       be that excuse.
   </p>
   
   <p>When I wrote you last I was attending the Penn. State Normal School at Edinboro. Since then I have been in the school room [
      <span class="unclear">as a?</span>]
       student or teacher
      nearly all of the [
      <span class="unclear">time?</span>]
       I have just finished a very nice ess[

      teachers

      <span class="unclear">s a high

      and have just entered upon the study of Law; In conseq[
      <span class="unclear">uence?</span>]
       of my very [
      <span class="unclear">li?</span>]
      mited means (as you know) I cannot remain
      in the [
      <span class="unclear">office?</span>]
       longer
      than next fall.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Though we enjoyed our homeless life in Washington I think I have enjoyed my more
      wandering life since then somewhat better If the world gives me few pennies it at
      least gives me few curses, and, some kind words: Is this good philosophy?
   </p>
   
   <p>Any words of comfort you may have to send me Dear friend, in reply to this, will be
      to me "like unto the shadow of a great rock in a weary land".
   </p>
   
   <p>I do not know that this will find you immediately—you may have "changed base"
      since '68, though I trust it may.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman began his correspondence with
      soldier Byron Sutherland on . In
      April 1870, Sutherland was teaching in Jamestown, N. Y. In reply to Walt
      Whitman's request for further information about his life, the former soldier
      observed on : "You remember me in
      1865 a green vain(?) lad of Eighteen—without, even, an imperfect knowledge of
      the rudimentary English branches, I came home from Washington and applied
      myself, as soon as possible, to school and to study . . . My life since we
      parted that July day upon the Treasury steps, has been one of hard work and
      little recreation—I find on looking back to that time, that I am not so pure or
      trusting—that the world isint quite so fair and beautiful as it seemed then—That
      the world is not precisely a green pasture for unsophistocated human lambs to
      skip in—That I like dreaming less, and work or excitement better—That I have
      lost a great deal of Ambition, and gained a like quantity of stupidity— That I
      dont know nearly so much as I once supposed I did."
