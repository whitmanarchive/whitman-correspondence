   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00423_n14">1. This letter dates to
      between March 26 and March 31, 1860. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's date is
      illegible, but "31" is the most probable reading, after consultation of the
      original letter in the Trent Collection. However, "26," "27," and "30" are
      also reasonable transcriptions.<br><br>
      Richard Maurice Bucke dated this letter March 30, 1860, and Edwin Haviland
      Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:50–51, n. 10). Multiple subjects in the letter date
      the letter to a range near the date proposed by Bucke and Miller: the recent
      rental of a floor to the Brown family (see Thomas Jefferson Whitman's  letter), Andrew Jackson Whitman's
      throat illness, and Jesse Whitman's employment at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and
      his desire to return home (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). Bucke's
      date (March 30) and the date transcribed here (March [31?]) are possible,
      but so are earlier dates within the range from March 26 through March
      31.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00423_n3">3. Andrew Jackson Whitman
      (1827–1863) was Walter Whitman, Sr., and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son,
      and Walt Whitman's brother. Andrew developed a drinking problem that contributed
      to his early death, leaving behind his wife Nancy McClure Whitman, who was
      pregnant with son Andrew, Jr., and their two sons, George "Georgy" and James
      "Jimmy." For more on Andrew, see Martin G. Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>

   <p id="duk.00423_n13">4. Pleurisy is an inflammation
      of the chest or lungs, which in the nineteenth century was judged difficult to
      distinguish from pneumonia. Medical dictionaries from the period differ, but the
      seventh or ninth day is commonly suggested as the day on which fever begins to
      abate.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00423_n5">5. Cupping is a means of
      bloodletting, which uses a heated cup. In wet cupping, shallow incisions
      induce bloodletting. In dry cupping, which is most likely what Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman describes here, blood is drawn to surface of the skin.<br><br>
      Blistering is the application of an irritant, often derived from the
      blistering fly (also known as Spanish fly), to the surface of the skin to
      produce a blister and a discharge. See Richard Dennis Hoblyn, <em>A Dictionary of Terms Used in Medicine and the Collateral
         Sciences</em> (Philadelphia: Blanchard, 1856).

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00423_n4">6. Nancy McClure Whitman was
      the wife of Walt Whitman's brother, Andrew Jackson Whitman. James "Jimmy" and
      George "Georgy" were Nancy and Andrew's sons, and Nancy was pregnant with
      Andrew, Jr., when her husband died in December 1863. Andrew, Jr., died in 1868,
      and Georgy died in 1872. For Nancy and her children, see Jerome M. Loving, ed.,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>

      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975), 13–14.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00423_n8">7. Cornell is James H.
      Cornwell, a friend of Andrew Whitman, who got him a job in North Carolina in
      1863 building fortifications. Cornwell served as a judge in the Brooklyn City
      Hall and is listed as a lawyer in the 1870 census, which also identifies his
      wife as Mary (b. 1822?) (<em>United States Census, 1870</em>,
      Brooklyn, Kings, New York). He is mentioned in Whitman's "Scenes in a Police
      Justices' Court Room" (<em>Brooklyn Daily Times</em>, September 9,
      1857). For more on the relationship between Andrew Jackson Whitman and Cornwell,
      see Martin G. Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>

      142–148.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n11">8. Jesse Whitman
      (1818–1870) was the first-born son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr. He suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence
      for several years before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in
      December 1864. Shortly after an outburst that followed his brother Andrew
      Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened Martha Mitchell and
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in
      some hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see Jeff's  to Walt Whitman). Louisa resisted
      institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her  letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put
      him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic
      Asylum on Flatbush Avenue, where he remained until his death on March 21, 1870
      (see E. Warner's  letter to Walt).
      For a short biography of Jesse, see Robert Roper, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.01011.pdf">"Jesse Whitman, Seafarer,"</a>

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00423_n7">9. The church is Henry Ward
      Beecher's Plymouth Church. Beecher (1813–1887), Congregational clergyman
      and brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, accepted the pastorate of the Plymouth
      Church, Brooklyn, in 1847. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son Edward attended
      Beecher's church.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00423_n11">10. According to Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's  letter to
      Walt Whitman, the Brown family rented the "lower part" of the house at $14 per
      month. John Brown, a tailor, and his family remained in the house for five
      years, but the relationship between the Browns and Jeff Whitman's family was
      often strained. Louisa's reference to John Brown as an "uncommon name" evokes
      the noted abolitionist, who was executed six months before this letter was
      written. The famous abolitionist John Brown (1800–1859) began pursuing a
      violent guerilla war against slavery in Kansas and Missouri in 1856. In October
      1859, Brown stormed a federal armory at Harper's Ferry but was captured by
      marines under the command of Robert E. Lee. Brown's execution ten days later
      transformed him into a martyr for the abolitionist cause (see Robert McGlone,
      "John Brown," <em>American National Biography Online</em>).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00423_n16">11. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      wrote again the following week: "a letter come from Boston wanted A Book and I
      made a mistake and put some other in the letter" (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman). The letter
      or letters from Boston are not known.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00467_n1">12. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00423_n15">13. The name "Walt" is the only
      probable reading, but the letter "l" is omitted.<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n15">14. Walt Whitman traveled to
      Boston in early March 1860 to oversee printing of the third edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> by Thayer and Eldridge. For a detailed
      account of Whitman's time in Boston, see his  letter to Thomas Jefferson Whitman.<a href="#r14">[back]
