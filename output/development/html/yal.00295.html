      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Mr. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The sea ought to be grateful to you; for its shifting mounds &amp; boundless heave have
      been dumb from Eternity until you voiced them in deep human music.
      Is there such a thing as a makrophone, to render in vocal facsimile &amp; miniature
      the thunders &amp; voices of great sounds? It seems to me you do this in yr
      sea-chants. When something new of 
      yrs
      
       comes I am as Herder when he 
      rec'd
      
       a new book of Richter;<sup><a href="#yal.00295_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I am unfitted for anything else—for some
      hours. I am glad you sound a sea-trumpet at the barbican of 
      yr
      
       book, for I think you greatest in 
      yr
      
       sea-interpretations.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I noticed last 
      yr
      
       at Marshfield, as we drove along that marvellous beach with the green waves
      curling over on the polished mirror of the sand, how deftly the wind took each wave
      and tossed back from it a helmet-crest of white spray. I feel terribly presumptuous
      in making a suggestion to you, for there is not a word, a collection of words in yr
      work that is not deeply studied &amp; profoundly implicated in the general tissue of
      the whole,—but what wd you say to omitting the fourth line—white-maned
      racers?<sup><a href="#yal.00295_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> The usage I know is irresistibly suggested to one looking at the waves; but
      then it has been ridden to death by so many poetasters that—well, it is no <u>blemish</u> of course in yr magnificent strain of elemental
      music, But you might consider my suggestion, if you think best.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>P.S.</p> 
   
   <p>We have a Liberal Union Club here &amp; we dine at Young's once a month. Prof Sumner<sup><a href="#yal.00295_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      of Yale &amp; other "eminent" men address the club &amp; we have long reports in the
      Bost. Sunday Herald. Geo. W. Curtis<sup><a href="#loc.01149_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> is one of the Vice Presidents. Maybe we can get
      you to come on &amp; give us a talk on Hegel or religion: 
      wd 
      
       you? Say next May, close of May.
   </p>
   
   <p>Howells—the women's pet—doesn't live here in Belmont any longer,<sup><a href="#yal.00295_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; I am not
      sorry. Why is it that when you think of Howells you always think of women's
      underclothing, soft limbs &amp; languid bosoms &amp; millinery in general? Bah!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00295_n1">1. Kennedy is referring to the
      Romantic novelist Johann Paul Friedrich Richter (1763–1825) and the Weimar
      philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803), who became intimate
      friends in the last years of Richter's life.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00295_n2">2. Kennedy is discussing
      Whitman's poem "With Husky-Haughty Lips, O Sea." The poem—including the
      line Kennedy objected to—was published in <em>Harper's
         Monthly</em> in March, 1884.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00295_n3">3. William Graham Sumner
      (1840–1910) was a professor of social sciences at Yale who also authored
      books on American history and political theory.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01149_n2">4. George William Curtis
      (1824–1892) was a New England writer and orator, who had been a neighbor
      of Emerson for some time in the 1840s.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00295_n4">5. William Dean Howells
      (1837–1920), novelist and "Dean of American Letters" who wrote <em>The Rise of Silas Lapham</em> (1885) among others, described
      his first meeting with Whitman at Pfaff's in <em>Literary Friends
         and Acquaintances</em> (New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1900), 73–76.
      Howells lived in Belmont, Massachusetts, from 1878 until the early 1880s, where
      he wrote <em>The Lady of Aroostook</em> (1879) and began <em>A Woman's Reason</em> (1883).<a href="#r5">[back]
