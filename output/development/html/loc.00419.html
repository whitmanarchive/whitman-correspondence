      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>It has been a long time since I last wrote you, longer than I meant it should be,
      but I have been very busy indeed &nbsp;Everything is going about as usual with us at home.
      We do not hear from George. I feel quite anxious about him and watch the paper quite
      close for something about the 51st but do not meet with any success.<sup><a href="#loc.00419_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Andrew is not getting any better I fear. I think that he will hardly get well again
      Walt. The doctor[s] all say that he must go out from the seashore if he wants to get well. I am sure that it would be a good thing for him if he could do so for
      a while. Do you think of any way that it could be done. As for myself I am over head
      and heels in debt (borrowed money) which I am striving hard to pay up and hardly know
      how I can do anything worthy of being called help for him. He is badly off. He can
      hardly speak, nor eat anything, but worse than all I guess that his home comforts
      are not much. I dont think Nancy has the faculty of fixing things to eat for a sick man. Andrew still
      goes to the Navy Yard and thereby gets his pay, but I hardly thinks he does anything.
      Sometime he is much better than others but as a general thing he is mighty badly off. I wish
      you would think about the matter Walt, and let us hear what your idea is &nbsp;Andrew wants
      to go but dont know where to go or how to leave his family. Mother I see is very much excited about
      him. Mother is getting along about as usual not quite as well perhaps, the warm,—hot,—wethre has a bad effect upon Mother. I dont think she looks as well as she did a month ago &nbsp;Mattie is getting along first rate.
      The baby, as a matter of course, is cross,—cross as thunder—but Mat is patient and
      hard working and so gets along quite well. Hattie is also showing the effects of a so long continued
      [term?] of <em>hot</em> days and is cross and fretful. She often wishes that you would come and take her
      on fort Greene.<sup><a href="#loc.00419_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> She seems to think that that is your mission. The baby is growing finely and is getting
      to look almost like Hattie did at her age. Her hair is getting lighter and i guess
      will be about the color of mine
   </p>
   
   <p>The enclosed $2 is sent $1 by John D. Martin<sup><a href="#loc.00419_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> and $1 by Henry Carlow.<sup><a href="#loc.00419_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> I wish you would write me a <em>Hospital letter</em>. I think I can get some money on it. Any way Walt so long as the Spondulix<sup><a href="#loc.00419_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> comes. A "Mr Fulton, of the New York Times"<sup><a href="#loc.00419_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> came some time since and got your address and again a few days since and wanted me
      when I wrote you to ask if you had received a letter from him. He said that he had
      written you but had not received a reply and [was] afraid you had not received it
   </p> 
   
   <p>Do you have any idea where the 9 Corps is. I guess down in Miss. yet &nbsp;I think not
      hearing from George hurts Mother about as much as any thing. I too feel pretty anxious
   </p>
   
   <p>Ruggles<sup><a href="#loc.00419_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> thinks that you could make a good thing by writing letters to the Times, better than
      the lectures.<sup><a href="#loc.00419_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> Write me, Walt.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00419_n1">1. The year is added in
      another hand, probably Walt Whitman's.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00419_n2">2. As part of the Ninth
      Corps, George's regiment had fought in Mississippi under Wililam T. Sherman
      during July and was now returning to Cincinnati where it arrived August 14, 1863
      (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington
         Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975], 97,
      100–101).<a href="#r2">[back]

      Walt from .<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.00419_n4">4. John D. Martin was an
      engineer.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00419_n5">5. Henry Carlow, an
      engineer, is listed in the Brooklyn directory for 1859/60, but not in the
      subsequent years.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00419_n6">6. This slang term, more
      often spelled "spondulicks," means money or cash.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="loc.00419_n7">7. Unidentified.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00419_n8">8. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–67) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his
      practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems"
      (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961], 1:90, n. 85).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00419_n9">9. After having
      contemplated giving lectures for several weeks (see Jeff's letters to Walt from
       and ), Walt Whitman took Ruggles' advice and wrote "Washington in
      the Hot Season" and "Letter from Washington" for the <em>New York
         Times</em> (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961], 1:136, n.
      14, and 140, n. 27).<a href="#r9">[back]
