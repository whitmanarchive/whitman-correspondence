      <br></br>Dr Sir.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We want to be the publishers of Walt. Whitman's poems—Leaves of Grass.—When the book
      was first issued we were clerks in the establishment we now own.<sup><a href="#loc.00560_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      We read the book with profit and pleasure. It is a true poem and writ by a <u>true</u> man.
   </p>
   
   <p>When a man dares to speak his thought in this day of refinement—so called—it is difficult
      to find his mates to act amen to it. Now <u>we</u> want to be known as the publishers of Walt. Whitman's books, and put our name as
      such under his, on title pages.—If you will allow it we can and will put your books
      into good form, and style attractive to the eye; we can and will sell a large number
      of copies; we have great facilities by and through numberless Agents in selling. We
      can dispose of more books than most publishing houses (we do not "puff" here but speak
      <u>truth</u>).
   </p>
   
   <p>We are young men. We "celebrate" ourselves by acts. Try us. You can do us good. We
      can do you good—pecuniarily.
   </p>
   
   <p>Now Sir, if you wish to make acquaintance with us, and accept us as your 
      
      publishers, we will offer to either buy the stereotype plates of Leaves of Grass,
      or pay you for the use of them, in addition to regular copyright.
   </p>
   
   <p>Are you writing other poems? Are they ready for the press? Will you let us read them?
      Will you write us? Please give us your residence
