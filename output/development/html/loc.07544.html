   <p>Fair yesterday—a little dull &amp; tedious cribb'd up here so long, but got
      along—quite decided bowel action in the forenoon, &amp; a good thorough
      hot-water bath (tub) in the afternoon—my diet continues the same, mutton broth
      (plenty of rice in it,) dry toast, and a cup of milk (or two, during the day) with
      some ice cream (wh' tastes good &amp; welcome) ab't 1½ p m—I fancy I am
      growing very, very slowly to have more strength—but sit here pretty much the
      same—(I thoroughly believe in your diagnosis in letter of 24th)<sup><a href="#loc.07544_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>This morning comes the Boston <em>Herald</em> of Jan: 3d with a
      splendid, nearly two-column criticism &amp; setting forth of the big book,<sup><a href="#n4188" id="r3">3</a></sup> from
      Sylvester Baxter<sup><a href="#n6000" id="r4">4</a></sup>—wh' I think even you will applaud &amp;
      be satisfied with—I will send the paper,<sup><a href="#med.00844_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> but first wish to know if you have
      rec'd one from S B himself—(as I find I send sometimes what you have
      before)—
   </p>
   
   <p>To-day opens dark &amp; wet &amp; lowering enough—no severe cold yet—I
      still have signs of my "cold in the head" (not violent) yet—a letter from
      Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r6">6</a></sup>—affectionate &amp; devoted—sit here in
      the big chair three quarters idling—no emphasized physical
      uncomfortableness—

   <p><em>Sunday Jan 6</em></p>
   
   <p>Lowering weather continued. A nice 20 minutes' call from Johnston<sup><a href="#n0336" id="r7">7</a></sup> &amp; Dick Hinton<sup><a href="#n6013" id="r8">8</a></sup>—also f'm Tom Harned<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n1" id="r9">9</a></sup>—am ab't the same—comfortable enough—as

      to the wash-room—got in a cord of cut oak wood yesterday (ready therefore for
      a cold spell)—bowel action—Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r11">11</a></sup> has just
      call'd—good luck to the meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r12">12</a></sup>—

      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4188">3. Whitman often referred to <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888) as his "big book." With
      the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made the presswork and binding decisions,
      and Frederick Oldach bound the volume, which included a profile photo of the
      poet on the title page. Philadelphia publisher David McKay published the book in
      December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n6000">4. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="med.00844_n1">5.  Baxter's review of
      Whitman's <em>Complete Poems and Prose</em> was titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/complete/anc.00131.html">Whitman's Complete Works</a>" and was published in the <em>Boston Herald</em> on January 3, 1889. The review was unsigned. See also

   <p id="n3039">6. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0336">7. John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n6013">8. Richard Josiah Hinton
      (1830–1901) was born in London and came to the U.S. in 1851. He trained as
      a printer, and, like the radical abolitionist writer and publisher James
      Redpath, went to Kansas and joined John Brown. In fact, but for an accident he
      would have been with Brown at Harper's Ferry. A man mistaken for Hinton was
      hanged. Together with Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Hinton also planned the
      jailbreak of John Brown's accomplices Albert Hazlett and Aaron Stevens in
      Charlestown for the "Jayhawkers," a band of abolitionists who assisted slaves
      through the Underground Railroad that included Silas S. Soule. With James
      Redpath he was the author of <em>Hand-book to Kansas Territory and
         the Rocky Mountains' Gold Region</em> (New York: J. H. Colton, 1859). Later
      he wrote <em>Rebel Invasion of Missouri and Kansas</em> (Chicago:
      Church &amp; Goodman, 1865) and <em>John Brown and His Men</em>
      (New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company, 1894). Apparently Hinton had suggested
      that Thayer &amp; Eldridge print <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (see <em>The New Voice</em>, 16 [4 February 1899], 2). Hinton served in
      the Union Army from 1861 to 1865, and saw Whitman while lying wounded in a
      hospital, a scene which he described in the Cincinnati <em>Commercial</em> on August 26, 1871. After the war Hinton wrote for many
      newspapers. He defended William O'Connor's <em>The Good Gray
         Poet</em> in the Milwaukee <em>Sentinel</em> on February 9,
      1866. Hinton's article in the Rochester <em>Evening Express</em>
      on March 7, 1866, "Farms and Fortunes in England and America," included a
      lengthy discussion of Whitman, with quotations from O'Connor and John Burroughs.
      Obviously pleased, Whitman sent it to friends, including William Michael
      Rossetti, who acknowledged it on 
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.28.html">Saturday, August 11, 1888</a>). See also Traubel, <em>With

   <p id="loc.03745_n1">9. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel, was Horace Traubel's
      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4319">10. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">11. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
