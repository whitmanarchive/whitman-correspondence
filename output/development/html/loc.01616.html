      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I wonder if you have quite forgotten me. I know the first thing you will very
      naturally do will be to look to the end of this letter 
      endeavour
      
       to decipher the signature, &amp; then maybe get to thinking of when &amp;
      where &amp; how it comes to pass that you hear from one—you will then I hope
      remember that some months ago (in the Early part of December I think it was for I
      know Washington was busy with preparations for the reopening of Congress). I came
      to
      see you in [
      <span class="unclear">
         yr
         
         ?</span>]
       office at the
      Treasury—And
      we had a long walk &amp; talk together. I then  promised that I would write to you when
      I reached England perhaps you have thought me forgetful. I hope not for indeed I
      think of you very very often &amp; though sometimes one feels as if there were a
      huge gulf between this and America at others again the thousands of miles of
      sounding sea seems but as a very little space &amp; I must say that since I have
      crossed this ferry—shaken hands upon the other side the distance seems as
      nothing &amp; the desire to return once more gets stronger every day—I have
      been very, very much occupied &amp; intensely busy one way &amp; another arrears of
      work claimed my attention for you know I am not a "briefless barrister" &amp;
      latterly my work has increased but I have determined that this  glorious spring time shall not pass
      without my carrying out 
      the my
      
       intention of scribbling to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I think that most countries are perhaps most beautiful in spring time certainly
      England is to my mind—you know the whole country looks like one lovely garden
      bursting forth into new life. Every shade of green— the
      grass like Emeralds, &amp; the perfect effects of light
      &amp; shadow &amp; really what with the songs of birds, the smell of the flowers the
      clouds the rainbows &amp; sunlights as I see them &amp; hear them all over this my
      room One can almost for the time forget care &amp; sorrow &amp; believe that after
      all <u>this</u> is Paradise—&amp; so it is if one will only
      make it so. I long for you very often to see all this country. It is so different
      &amp; yet so like to yours. Differences, I think very great yet almost
      indistinguishable, certainly for the most part differences which  can be better felt
      than 
      exprest
      
      . When are you coming—What month—what week in what steamer. I
      know you will go to Brooklyn &amp; then for 
      Xing
      
       in the Ferry boat among the crowd of people &amp; I hear the bells
      jangling &amp; I see the great [
      <span class="unclear">
         Comander's
         
         ?</span>]
       coming from us to you &amp; going from you to us. &amp; then
      you will meet 
      Yr.
      
       mother &amp; spend with her a few days. &amp; then will you not cross
      again to the great new york and walk straight to the office take ticket &amp; spend
      9 days of 
      yr
      
       holiday upon the great Atlantic—land at 
      L'pool
      
       and come on to me. Remember you promised that you would do so and I have
      been counting and relying upon 
      yr
      
       promise and am very very anxious to show you all I can &amp; to see you
      again.
   </p>
   
   <p>I must tell you that I gave Alfred Tennyson 
      yr
      
       books.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>he was much touched by your [
      <span class="unclear">memory?</span>]
       of him, and I told him of 
      yr
      
       deep regard for him &amp; that you were coming over here this [
      <span class="unclear">year?</span>]
       which seemed to please
      him, and I can promise you from him too a hearty welcome. Indeed until you come, you
      can hardly I think understand how many friends you have. I do not know that I have
      very much news to tell you for really 
      yr
      
       papers contain all. I seemed to know [
      <span class="unclear">more?</span>]
       of what was going on here when I was
      "over there" than I do [
      <span class="unclear">now?</span>]
       somehow.
   </p>
   
   <p>Lowe our 
      Chancellor of Exchequer
      
       has just taken a leaf out of the transatlantic page &amp; taxed
      matches. I think if I remember the tax has been a very bad
      one with you, &amp; led to many evil results. here there is a general dislike to
      it
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Swinburne goes on writing a good deal he has been ill very
      ill. It is fearful to see his life utterly wretched &amp; unmanly I think it seems
      that his craving for drink is quite [
      <span class="unclear">incurable?</span>]
      —Now I am not going to write any more just
      at present but will write again soon &amp; hope that perhaps before very long I may
      hear from you—&amp; that you are well.
   </p>
   
   <p>Any news you may have will you say, &amp; anything you think will be very welcome
      &amp; intensely 
      interesting to me, but if you tell me that you have finally [
      <span class="unclear">reached?</span>]
       to come over to us
      directly this will be then most pleasing of all—this will delight me—I
      send you a little book written by a friend of mine printed only for private
      circulation, it is rather prettily done I think, not perhaps very original &amp;
      wanting in power, but still there is something engaging about it— He  is an artist with a
      spark of the divine light in him to be sure—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Cyril Flower (1843–1907) was an English
      barrister and a friend of Tennyson; see Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt
         Whitman in England</em> (1934), 128–129. According to the February 20,
      1886 <em>Solicitor's Journal</em>, Flower was appointed a Lord of
      the Treasury; Flower served as a member of Parliament from 1880 to 1892, when he
      was given the title Baron Battersea (see the London <em>Gazette</em> (6 September 1892), 5090). According to Flower's  letter, he met Whitman in Washington
      in December, 1870. He had later delivered some of Whitman's books to Tennyson,
      who "was much touched by your memory of him, and I told him of your deep regard
      for him." On , Flower informed
      Whitman that Tennyson was sending a letter by the same mail (Tennyson's letter
      was dated ). Flower wrote again on
      : "When I read you or think of
      you . . . I feel that I hold in my hand clasped strong &amp; tight &amp; for
      security the great hand of a friend, a simple good fellow, a man who loves me
      &amp; who is beautiful because he loves, &amp; with the consciousness of that I
      feel never alone—never sad."
