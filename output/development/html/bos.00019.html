      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Before any more days pass I must write and tell thee of our visit to Tennyson,<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r1">1</a></sup> which took place day before yesterday.
   </p>
   
   <p>We sent him thy letter from Lord Mount Temple's, where we were staying. His son
      Hallam wrote to us from the Isle of Wight, asking us to come Wednesday morning. So,
      Wednesday, about half past eleven, papa and Alys and I alighted at his front door,
      where a huge, curly dog overwhelmed us with caresses. Tennyson was not in, but Lady
      Tennyson<sup><a href="#n0903" id="r2">2</a></sup> received us and talked with us until he came. We
      were walking in the old-fashioned flower garden when we met him, and almost the
      first thing he said was a "deep remark." He said that he was walking out one evening
      looking at the stars, so absorbed that he fell into a puddle; but he noticed
      afterward that the star was in the puddle also! Thereupon we all tried to think of
      something witty in reply. Something about poet's feet tangled among stars would have
      been appropriate, but as none of us thought of that reply till afterward, we had to
      let the opportunity slip. We walked with him and with his son all about the garden
      for about an hour. He showed us a tree planted by Gambetta,<sup><a href="#bos.00019_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> and talked to me about Turgeineff,<sup><a href="#bos.00019_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> and asked all about thee.
   </p>
   
   <p>As we were going away, he told me to give thee his love. His home is a large,
      rambling, old-fashioned house full of interesting pictures and engravings. It has
      a
      look of being lived in, and all the arrangements were "casual," as English people
      say. Hats and walking-sticks were lying about in chairs and dogs raced in and out
      at
      their pleasure.
   </p> 
   
   <p>Tennyson's "den" is up at the top of a narrow, winding stair—a large, sunny room,
      lined with books and having a lovely view of Freshwater Bay, framed in the dark
      green branches of the cedars of Lebanon. They insisted upon our staying to lunch,
      but made us promise not to put anything in any newspaper about it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Tennyson seems to have a horror of notoriety, and he told us a great many stories
      of
      the annoyances to which he had been subjected from curious, inquisitive, and
      gossiping visitors.
   </p>
   
   <p>The chief impression that his conversation made upon me was of a keen and eager mind
      (he has a wonderful memory for facts) and a keen sense of humor. He tells a funny
      story as well as anyone I ever heard. We came away soon after lunch, having had a
      most interesting visit, for which we all felt very grateful to thee..., Alys<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> looks forward to going to see thee when she comes home
      in September, and to showing thee the photograph of himself which Tennyson gave her,
      with his autograph beneath.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina

   <p id="n0625">1. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r1">[back]
