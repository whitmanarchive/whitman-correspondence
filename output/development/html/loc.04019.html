      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mont
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have come on here (about 500 miles further) &amp; am stopping in this city for a few
      days situated very comfortably &amp; feeling pretty well—the journey is doing
      me good, for I lay quite sick in London about three weeks. I am better, &amp;
      enjoying everything. I am traveling mostly by water,—and spent several days in
      "the Lakes of the Thousand Islands"—that is what they call a part of the St
      Lawrence river, some 50 miles long, &amp; 10 to 20 wide, filled with the prettiest
      islands you ever see, all sizes, some quite big with fine farms on them, &amp; some
      very moderate—others rocky hills like, of an acre or two covered with
      cedars—but <u>the water</u> every where I travel in this
      country is the best part,—it is more beautiful and bright than you can conceive,
      very clean &amp; pure, of a sky-blue color &amp; there seems no end of it—I
      travel for days &amp; days over it, from Lake Huron on through Lake Erie and Ontario
      &amp; down the St Lawrence to here (700 miles) &amp; it is just as fascinating to me
      now as ever—I have been in sight of it or traveling on it ever since I have been in
      Canada—I never get tired of it—(We have nothing like it our way, so
      grand &amp; bright &amp; clear.)
   </p>
   
   <p>—This is a large &amp; busy city, the most
      important in Canada, ships and steamboats &amp; immense numbers of
      emigrants—This is in general 
      quite a great farming country—the land not near so rich &amp; good as out west in the
      United States,—
      dont raise such corn &amp;c—but it is a healthy &amp; 
      beautiful country here, good climate—pretty good for wheat—they raise a good deal
      of barley here, 
      (perhaps more than any other grain)—but a fair show of wheat—first rate for grass—ditto
      for 
      apples—then there is so good a chance for a farmer to have his farm run down to the
      water—As I travel I see
      hundreds and hundreds of farms, seems to me a majority of them along the banks,—they
      set a little up, &amp;
      sprinkled with trees—looks as though the folks ought to be happy—(but I suppose they
      are just like all
      the rest of us)—It is very different from what I saw out in Kansas last fall—no water
      <u>there</u></p>
   
   
   
   <p>I often think of you all, I wish your father could be out here, &amp; travel through
      it once see the country &amp; the water &amp; farming &amp; everything—he
      would enjoy seeing it all, &amp; would understand many things about it better than I
      do—But <u>you</u> ought to take some such trip Mont boy,
      it would make you open your eyes—(Only I must say I like the smell of the <u>salt and sedge</u> along the water, it is what I was born to,
      like Long Island or Old Jersey—but it is all <u>fresh</u>
      here)—
   </p>
   
   <p>—I am going on some 400 miles further—north east to the river Saguenay, (you will
      see it on
      the map of Canada toward north east)—then back again to stay awhile in the old
      city of Quebec—give my love to your parents—tell your mother I 
      rec'd
      
       her letter—love to Debby, I 
      rec'd
      
       her letter too—love to Ed and Harry &amp; Jo and Van, and Ruthey
      &amp; Georgey—I 
      rec'd
      
       a postal from Harry—Mont you &amp; your mother write—I send
      envelope.<sup><a href="#loc.04019_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
