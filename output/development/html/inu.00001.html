      <br></br><br></br>Edward Dowden, 
      <br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your kind letter of April 16 reach'd me yesterday—I find it full of animation &amp; cheer, with items 
      of news, &amp;c. interesting to me, &amp; only hope to get letters from you oftener. In my
      condition they 
      are trebly welcome. My tedious prostration continues—primarily and mainly an obstinate
      &amp; baffling
      cerebral affection, on which have been superinduced grave lesions of the stomach &amp;
      liver, (from the 
      enforced physical inaction of the last twenty-eight months)—Still I am up &amp; dressed
      &amp; around every day,
      go out, walk a little, (as I am crippled, left leg, quite badly) but eke out a jaunt
      with the horse cars, &amp;
      the ferry boats on the noble river here, the Delaware—all quite handy—the solution
      of the problem of recovery, 
      (even partial) is more or less uncertain, but of course I like to proceed on the supposition
      or assumption
      that I shall get better.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yes, I shall, unless prevented, bring out a volume this summer, partly as my contribution
      to our National
      Centennial. It is to be called "<em>Two Rivulets</em>"—(i.e. two flowing chains of prose
      and verse, emanating the real and ideal) it will embody much that I had previously
      written &amp; that you know,
      but about one third, as I guess, that is fresh. "<em>Leaves of Grass</em>," proper, will remain
      as it is identically—The new Vol. will have nearly or quite as much matter as L. of
      G. (It is a sort of omnibus,
      in which I have packed all the belated ones, since the outset of the <em>Leaves</em>.)<sup><a href="#inu.00001_n4" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I was writing to John Burroughs to day, I have enclosed to him your letter of 16th.<sup><a href="#inu.00001_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> His address is, <em>Esopus, Ulster Co. New York.</em> He is there permanently, having built himself a
      stone cottage in a beautiful spot on the banks of the Hudson, 60 miles north of New
      York City. He comes to see me—was
      here, well, about three weeks ago. I heard from Tennyson last summer, had a good friendly
      letter from him.<sup><a href="#inu.00001_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I have just had a long, capital &amp; most kind letter from W. M. Rossetti. Thanks for
      the
      <em>Shakspere</em>—the first &amp; second chapters I have read thoroughly—they are very
      <em>live</em>—I shall read it all &amp; write to you—the Contemporary Review is rec'd—thanks—<sup><a href="#inu.00001_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>

   <p>Thanks for Mr. Clifton's letter—best remembrances to Mrs. Dowden—not forgetting the
      dear little daughter &amp; baby—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>).

      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="inu.00001_n4">1. An excerpt from this
      paragraph appeared on May 29, 1875, in the <em>Academy</em>, to
      which William Michael Rossetti contributed. The article began: "Walt Whitman
      writes to a correspondent. . . ."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="inu.00001_n3">4. Dowden commented on this
      letter to his future (second) wife, Elizabeth D. West: "He writes very simply
      and affectionately and manfully." Dowden also had received about the same time a
      letter from Burroughs: "A deep alarm possesses Burroughs about Whitman's state
      of health (he says W. is so inexpressibly dear to him, the earth would seem
      hardly inhabitable without him.)" See Dowden's <em>Fragments of
         Old Letters, E. D. to E. D. W.</em>, 1869–1892 (London: Dent, 1914),
