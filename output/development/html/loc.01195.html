   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Asa K. Butts was a New York
      bookseller. Whitman was having difficulties around this time—real or
      imaginary, as his mother might have said—with booksellers. Commenting on
      one of the letters of Butts, Whitman observed to Horace Traubel in 1889: "What a
      sweat I used to be in all the time . . . over getting my damned books published!
      When I look back at it I wonder I didn't somewhere or other on the road chuck
      the whole business into oblivion" (<em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.79.html">Friday, January 18, 1889</a>). Butts went bankrupt in 1874.

      the Feinberg Collection, Doolady received 100 copies of <em>As a
         Strong Bird on Pinions Free</em> from S. W. Green on February 25, 1873
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,

   <p id="loc.01195_n3">4. S. W. Green, according to
      a receipt in the Feinberg Collection, had 572 copies of the poem on July 12,
      1872. At the time Whitman owed Green $175, evidently for printing this poem as
      well as other works, the names of which are indecipherable. On the verso of the
      receipt Green noted that Whitman had paid $100 on July 20, 1872, and in a letter
      on  he acknowledged payment of $50.<a href="#r4">[back]
