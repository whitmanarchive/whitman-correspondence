   <p>The Hospital notes "Last of the war cases"<sup><a href="#loc.07220_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> are intensely interesting—especially
      the extracts from the Letters to your mother—I should greatly like to read the
      whole letters<sup><a href="#loc.07220_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> and shall ask you to let me see them next time I am East. Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup> gives me somewhat better accounts of your health—I guess
      you have had some pretty hot weather—it is and has been warm even here but not
      disagreeably so—you will recollect that I have proofs to 117<sup><a href="#loc.07510_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup>—my old
      friend (and yours) Jack Harkness<sup><a href="#n4278" id="r6">6</a></sup> (you will recollect him at
      Kingston and down the St Laurence and up  the Saguenay?) will be here today for a
      little visit. All goes well with us here, we all keep well. I think I told you that
      Willy Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r7">7</a></sup> had finished his meter. If we have luck we shall
      make some money out of it.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em>; "Last of the War Cases"

   <p id="loc.07220_n3">3. Bucke eventually edited a
      collection of Whitman's letters to his mother (<em>The Wound
         Dresser: A Series of Letters Written from the Hospitals in Washington During
         the War of the Rebellion </em>[1898]).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="n4278">6. John "Jack" Harkness
      (1841–1916) was a friend and colleague of Richard Maurice Bucke, with whom
      he attended McGill University's Medical School until 1862.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4284">7. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
