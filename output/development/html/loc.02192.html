   </p>
   
   <p>I am staying for a couple of weeks in the country 98 miles N.W. of London. At George
      Eliot's native place &amp; I see traces of the great novelist everywhere.
   </p>
   
   <p>The workman—[
      <span class="unclear">M
         Alton?</span>]
      —withom
      
       I am lodging, says his father remembers seeing G. Eliot's father walk into Griff
      with a bag of tools
      slung over his shoulder—a carpenter, one who could read &amp; write, a rare
      thing for a workman in those days; soon he came to be made a land steward for a large
      estate,
      &amp; got on like a "house on fire" now his son Isaac Evans lives in 
      Griff house &amp; is a rich country gentleman. The character of Adam Bede is a
      portrait of her father, I will send it to you if you have not already read it? Tell
      me in your next letter. G Eliot was very fond of her father, and the only time he
      was severe with her, was
      
      
      once, when, she was a young woman at the time, a great student,
      and I suppose after a great deal of reflection and conning G Eliot came to the conclusion
      that
      to go to church and mumble a creed you no longer believed in was intolerable, and
      so, she told her
      father, for the first time, that she could not go to church any more; so Old Mr.
      Evans said 'you shall not live in my house then' she was greatly distressed but finally
      agreed to go to church. I am sketching her house, and a bit of her garden that she
      was particularly fond of, it makes quite
      a pretty little picture. I wish that I could show it to you, albeit, I can't.
   </p>
   
   <p>Am also
      sketching her house covered with creepers, ivy blue Japanese creeper sweet-peas and
      the rest a large [illegible]-tree on the
      lawn. George Eliot's brother inhabits this house, and is very friendly and
      hospitable to me, whilst I am at work on these sketches, considering that I have never
      seen him before; Miss Nelly
      
      
      George Eliot's Niece) has just returned from the Highlands; a fresh, lively, candid,
      pleasing,
      plain woman, rather churchy, but not obtrusively so; altogether very good fun. I
      had a jolly game of tennis on their lawn,—a lawn such as you Americans 
      dont
      
       dream of!!—with them.
   </p>
   
   <p>I went to Astley church this morning, an ancient church. The church
      was nearly empty, the clergyman was late—presently, I heard a scuffle in the
      belfry, I turned and saw a big raw
      country-bumpkin boy hastily donning his <u>white surplus</u>! He strides up the aisle; buries his face in his
      hands, on kneeling, with the exception of one eye which squints at the new comer, who is busy trying to find his place in the prayer book. The [
      <span class="unclear">raw?</span>]
       young Rector reads with a
      musical voice a curious contradiction to his face. I afterwards learned that he
      hunts (an unusual thing for a parson.) and on occasion can swear ably.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>There is a jolly [
      <span class="unclear">moated?</span>]
       castle quite close to this little church
      whither I shall wend next week, and sketch!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am writing by this
      post to Eustace Conway,
      my lawyer friend in New York, a gay young spark, a fine constant friend of mine of
      whom I have mentioned in other letters
      to you. I have told him that "I shall try and look him up in New York some day" he
      tells me that he has a spare bedroom for me whenever
      I like to go. And now goodbye Love to Debbie Ruthie Joe Mont: Van: Georgie: Ed: Where
      is Ed now? &amp; Hal and yourself.
