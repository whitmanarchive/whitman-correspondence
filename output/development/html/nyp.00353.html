      <br></br><br></br>Dear Nelly,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your good letter came all right—it is pretty much "the same subject continued"—with
      my health &amp; feelings—very grave depressions, alternated with more favorable spells—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To-day, as I write, I am in good spirits &amp; comparatively comfortable—after a painful
      attack last night—So it goes—What will be the finale remains to be seen.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I await your further letters with some curiosity—(for strange as it may seem, <em>men</em> have that weakness as well 
      as <em>your sect</em>)—I have to-day dispatched dear Mrs. Johnson's 
      picture by mail—(It is intended to be put in a <em>square gray or white mat with oval top</em>, 
      &amp; then in a plain black walnut rustic square frame, with thin strip of gilt inside,
      
      &amp; good plate glass)—I shall look for Charles Eldridge—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My sister is spending a few weeks at Atlantic City—I am <em>here</em>, (declining several invitations) muchly but pleasantly, 
      <em>alone</em>—We have a fine old Irish woman, (an old maid, not so very old either) who cooks nicely
      &amp; runs the domestic 
      machinery, for brothers George &amp; Eddy, &amp; self—She little knows how much good she does
      me with her great splendid 
      coarse face &amp; stout figure &amp; warm-blooded &amp; quaint &amp; simple &amp; affectionate ways—
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">Write soon, Nelly dear—
      <br></br>Walt.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00353_n1">1. This letter is
      endorsed, "Ans'd." Its envelope bears the address, "Mrs. E. M. O'Connor, |
      1015 O street, near 11th N. W. | Washington | D.C." It is postmarked:
      "Camden | Aug | 5 | N. (?) ; Carrier | 6 | Aug | 8 AM."<br><br>
      The year is corroborated by the allusion to Nancy Johnson in the third
      paragraph; see Whitman's  letter
      to Ellen O'Connor.<a href="#r1">[back]
