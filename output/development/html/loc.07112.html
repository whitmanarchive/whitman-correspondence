   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07112_n1">1. At the top of this page
      Whitman has written: "Dr B is interested in a new <u>meter</u> | a simple patented machine for measuring | the flow of water,
      gas, or anything &amp; also a cheap easy motor &amp;c I sent him one of | the
      two group | pictures." Below this note has been written in a different hand:
      "see | notes | Sept 4 | 1891."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07112_n2">2. The article Whitman sent to
      Bucke was probably Jonathan Trumbull, "Walt Whitman's View of Shakespeare" <em>Poet-Lore</em> 2.7 (15 July 1890): 368-71.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07112_n3">3. Dr. John Johnston and
      James William Wallace were members of a group of Whitman admirers in Bolton,
      Lancashire, England, who referrred to their little circle as the "Bolton
      College." Dr. Johnston visited Whitman in the summer of 1890, while Wallace
      visited both Whitman and Bucke in the fall of 1891. An account of "Bolton
      College" and of these visits is found in their <em>Visits to Walt
         Whitman in 1890-91</em> (1917). Bucke visited them in July 1891.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0839">4. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r4">[back]
