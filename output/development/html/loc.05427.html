      <br></br><br></br>Mr Walt Whitman
      <br></br>Dr Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I regret exceedingly the awkwardness which seemed to impress you this morning as
      a
      disposition to pry impudently into your business for the purpose of making you a
      subject of public gossip. Permit me to assure that such a motive was foreign to my
      mind. My object in calling upon you was simply that of friendly interest which I had
      been encouraged to think was reciprocal during our brief acquaintance in   Washington. If my
      presence was an intrusion pray pardon it: but do not I beseech you attribute to
      presumption or idle curiosity that which sprang only from the most disinterested
      feelings of friendship. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Trusting that this explanation will exonerate me from all undeserved suspicion, I
      have the honor to remain 
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Most respectfully
      <br></br>Redelia Bates.
