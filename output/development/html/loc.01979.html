      <br></br><br></br>Dear Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Please pardon my intrusion but as I am a great lover of literature especially poetry,
      I have always taken great interest in you and your poems and other writings and am
      a
      great admirer of them,
   </p>
   
   <p>I have often looked for your photograph but have never succeeded in obtaining one
      and
      have no definite idea of your features. I have been much disappointed in not
      securing you photograph and concluded that, perhaps, I could procure one of you Have
      you a photograph of yourself which you could send me?
   </p>
   
   <p>I enclose you 25Â¢ for photograph if yopu have one which you are willing to send
      to me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall anciously await your reply and hope that you will be so kind as to send a
      photograph. I have long desired your opinion on several matters in literature but
      will only ask you one. I have read and studied Mr. Joaquin Miller's poems "
      Songe
      
       of the Sierras" and have been greatly impressed by them. I am very curious
      to hear your opinions of him, and his poems. I shall be greatly indebted to you if
      you will give me an opinion of Mr/ Miller's [
      <span class="unclear">work?</span>]
       If you will be so kind as to answer my critical
      questions I will thank you very much.
   </p>
   
   <p>Will you if you are not occupied please write me with your own hand a copy of one
      of
      your poems?
   </p>
   
   <p>I do not wish to be a nuisance and a bore to you and if you have not plenty of
      leisure  I will
      not ask for the poem I have poems in the handwriting of Bryant, Longfellow, Holmes
      and Whittier and with yours if you send it I will complete the series of the <u>greatest</u> American poets. If you do not wish to answer I
      will not be greatly surprised for I presume you are nearly bored to death by
      "autograph friends" but I write you as a lover of literature and am not to be
      classed with the "friends" in any sense.
   </p>
   
   <p>With best wishes for your health and prosperity</p>

      I am always your friend and admirer
