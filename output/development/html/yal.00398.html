   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00398_n1">1. In a letter on , John T. Trowbridge had said that
      William H. Piper and Co., booksellers in Boston, were willing to take 50 copies
      of the new edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, and that he could
      personally recommend the firm. The firm was advertised as Whitman's Boston agent
      in books published in 1871 and 1872. Later Whitman authorized Asa K. Butts and
      Co. to collect the money Piper owed to him; see Whitman's  and  letters to Butts. For more on Trowbridge, see
      Whitman's  letter.<a href="#r1">[back]
