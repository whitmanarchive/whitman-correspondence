      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I trust the spirit may not be deemed intrusive which urges me to write &amp; wish you
      a happy New Year, &amp; to thank you at the same time for the happiness which I have
      had in reading "November Boughs."<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r2">2</a></sup> Christmas brought me a copy, the result of a
      special petition to Santa Claus, &amp; now I can look back through all the wisdom
      and beauty  of
      its pages, &amp; forward to a long intimacy with them, such as one has with one's
      own few books. I am so glad you wrote that "backward glance." It will be precious
      to
      all lovers of your poetry, &amp; stand as the truest &amp; most upright answer to
      its critics. Perhaps you do not know how great a pleasure it is to those who love
      poetry to see their poets again—Burns, Shakespeare, &amp; the rest—with
      a poet. It is like going through a gallery of paintings with an artist.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And your notes on Elias Hicks,<sup><a href="#n0301" id="r3">3</a></sup> a figure whom I might never have
      met elsewhere, were full of interest to me. It is very true that note on "The United
      States Today," &amp; so far as decline of spirituality is implied in that of
      definite beliefs, it is deeply to be regretted, and yet, amid such varied elements,
      one may say—is perhaps even more bound to say than in other parts of the
      world—"I will not accept a part for the whole, join one group of my fellow
      beings  &amp; cut
      myself off from the rest." The strongest spirituality has been shown here in
      individualities, in going direct to the heart of things, &amp; that is what you are
      helping us to know &amp; to feel.
   </p>
   
   <p>We have not heard any news of you for a long time, but hope earnestly that your
      health is better. My father joins me in heartfelt regards—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Very sincerely yours</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sophia Kirk (1855–1950) was
      an educator and writer in Pennsylvania, who, along with her sister, Anne Kirk,
      served on the staff of Bryn Mawr College. In 1899, the sisters began a small
      school preparatory to the college, known as "The Misses Kirk's School," Bryn
      Mawr (<em>A Handbook of Private Schools for American Boys and
         Girls</em>, 7th edition [Porter Sargent, Boston, MA: 1922], 193). In 1900,
      she contributed a essay on women and higher education entitled "The College Girl
      and the Outside World" to the April 1900 issue of <em>Lippincott's
         Monthly Magazine</em>. Sophia and Anne were the daughters of the historian,
      educator, and bibliographer John Foster Kirk, who had edited <em>Lippincott</em>'s from 1870 to 1886.

   <p id="n3999">2. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus

   <p id="n0301">3. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker from Long
      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his
      influence on Whitman, see David S. Reynolds, <em>Walt Whitman's
         America</em> (New York: Knopf, 1995), 37–39.<a href="#r3">[back]
