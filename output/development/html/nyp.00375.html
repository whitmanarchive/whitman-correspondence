      This postcard bears the address, "Pete Doyle, | M st. South, bet. 4½ &amp;
      6th | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Mar | 8 | N.J.; Carrier
      | 9 | Mar | 8 AM."<br><br>
      This postcard cannot be assigned to a specific year for obvious reasons: the
      allusions to Whitman's health are vague and in fact applicable to almost any
      time between 1873 and 1876; there are no concrete references to events which
      would make dating possible. However, it was written on a standard government
      postcard which was redesigned in 1876. <a href="#r1">[back]
