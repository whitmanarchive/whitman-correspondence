      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr Whitman,
      
   </p>  
   
   <p> I send you Alys'<sup><a href="#loc.04268_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> circular letter and will you please
      mail it to Miss Nicholson after you have read it. Alys must be having a delightful
      time, besides going through a most interesting experience. I am spending my summer
      among the Blue Ridge mountains in a place that belongs jointly to my mother and my
      aunt Mrs Pearsall Smith.<sup><a href="#loc.04268_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> The country is beautiful, and it is always quite cool. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I don't know whether you remember a young man whom you met at my Uncles several
      times Tom Worthington by name.  Alys he and I came over to see you once last winter. Both he and
      I want you to know that we are engaged to be married.<sup><a href="#loc.04268_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I still intend to continue my course at Bryn Mawr College which will be three
      years longer and then I shall most likely be married. My brother Bond, who is engaged
      to Miss Edith Carpenter<sup><a href="#loc.04268_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> one of Mariechen's<sup><a href="#loc.04268_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      Smith College friends expects to be married on the 13th of October, and he and Edith
      intend to live in Millville New Jersey. 
   </p> 
   
   <p>I hope, Mr. Whitman that you have not been sick this summer, but I have been afraid
      that these last few hot days have been hard for you; if you ever have time I wish
      you would let me know how you are, but this I shan't expect  you to do, because I know how over
      run you are with letters, so I shall have to wait till I come to Philadelphia next
      October and find out for my self. Tom Worthington is spending the summer with us and
      he wishes to be remembered to you, he is just at this moment writing a letter to the
      Nation on the labor question which has been on his mind for some time. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Hoping again that you are better </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04268_n6">1. This letter is addressed: Mr
      Walt Whitman | Mickle Street | Camden | <u>New Jersey</u>. It
      is postmarked: [illegible] | JUL | [illegible] | 1886 | PA.; CAMD[illegible] | JU[illegible] | [illegible] | 4PM | 1886 | REC'[illegible].<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.04268_n3">2. Alys Pearsall Smith
      (1867–1951) was a social activist and the wife of philosopher Bertrand
      Russell. Smith was the daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, a Quaker religious
      leader, evangelist, map publisher, and friend of Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04268_n2">3. Hannah Whitall Smith, wife
      of Robert Pearsall Smith, and mother of Mary and Alys.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04268_n4">4. The couple had three
      children but in 1896 Worthington divorced her—a scandal in the orthodox
      Quaker family.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04268_n5">5. Edith Carpenter
      (1863–1902) was a writer and social activist who would marry Grace
      Thomas's brother Bond Thomas. She committed suicide in 1902.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04268_n7">6. Mariechen was the family
      nickname for Alys Smith's sister, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945), who was
      a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom Whitman once called his
      "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian Renaissance art and a
      daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry B. F. C. "Frank"
      Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's English friends and
      would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them, including Anne Gilchrist
      shortly before her death. For more, see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1862–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
