      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have but lately read your poems, Leaves of Grass, but I find in them so much
      encouragement and hope, and such a great personality, that I write to express my
      simple thanks for the gift of the book and the great thoughts in it. Though I belong
      to England, and am English heart and soul, I know your America, who finds in you her
      first poetical expression, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from New York to Texas,
      and Minnesota, and the great West, Oregon, Washington, and California. I have toiled
      and travelled thousands of miles on the Pacific slope, and only regret that I had
      not Leaves of Grass with me to make me see even more than I did in three years of
      arduous struggle. But I thank you now, and with all sincerity, for a new religion
      and the knowledge of a great personality. In all events to come for me, you have had
      a great influence,<sup><a href="#loc.07038_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>

      and I am, dear sir, yours gratefully
