   <p>Yours of 3d Enclosing letters from Rhys,<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> O'Connor,<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r3">3</a></sup> Mrs Costelloe<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> and Logan Smith<sup><a href="#n6122" id="r5">5</a></sup> came duly to hand
      this morning. <u>All</u> were heartily welcome and at once read
      with pleasure. Yes I have the "Transcript"<sup><a href="#loc.07263_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> and this
      morning the "Bulletin"<sup><a href="#loc.07263_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup> came to hand from Horace. Do not
      forget to send me the "Pall Mall Gaz" cont'g Mr Summer's piece.<sup><a href="#loc.07263_n4" id="r8">8</a></sup> No doubt Ed. Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r9">9</a></sup> is with
      you now, I shall be very anxious to hear what impression he makes. I heard from Wm
      Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r10">10</a></sup> yesterday, all is going well with him and the
      meter, he will probably want me down in about a week—hope there will be no
      hitch about getting leave of absence from asylum. There are some little matters on
      hand and in prospect
      that may make it awkward for me to be away.
   </p>
   
   <p>Yes, I do not know what we should do without Horace,<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r11">11</a></sup> the kind of
      help he gives could not be bought for money and without him we should be badly stuck
      in many ways—I have the greatest admiration for him and the magnificent way he
      has behaved all through—I hope it may be in my power someday to show my
      appreciation of his excellent qualities in some practical way.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are having some delightful weather here now—some of those quiet, dreamy
      autumn days that leave such a sleepy charm.

   <p>I hope to see you soon, shall soon write again</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina

      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert

   <p id="n4284">10. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="n4267">11. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
