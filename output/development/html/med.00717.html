   <p>Thank the Columbus Buggy Co., and their workmen, for the beautiful looking and
      practically perfect buggy furnished me. I get out in it every day—my only
      exercise—and I find it the easiest riding vehicle I ever sat in. Thank them
      for a most opportune kindness and generosity to me.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Donaldson
      (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
      introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
      the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
      carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt
         Whitman, the Man</em> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see
