   </p>
   
   <p>I got home all right Sunday afternoon—had a nice enjoyable ride—enjoyed
      my visit anyhow—Yesterday I felt pretty dry, up in my room, &amp; made a glass
      of drink, water, sugar &amp; vinegar—from that bottle you gave me—such
      as I remember my dear mother<sup><a href="#loc.03938_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> making sixty years ago, for
      my father, of a hot day, when I was a little boy—&amp; my drink went well
      too—Nothing new of any importance with me—Send you enclosed a letter
      just rec'd from Edward Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r2">2</a></sup>—the dear good young
      man—I have just written him a few lines—told him ab't Harry<sup><a href="#n4310" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Warm &amp; sunny to-day &amp; I am sitting here with my
      window open—Mrs. D<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r4">4</a></sup> is off to Phil. &amp; I shall be here
      alone all the forenoon. The bird is singing—the cars are puffing &amp;
      rattling, &amp; the children of the neighborhood are all outdoors playing—So I
      have music enough—Best love to you all—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03938_n1">1. On May 23 Whitman noted
      in his Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) the
      "anniversary of dear mother's death—1873."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0141b">2. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4310">3. Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford (b.
      1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked by
      early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
