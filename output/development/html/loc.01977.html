      <br></br><br></br>My dear, Mr Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you an order for 39/‑ for a copy of your works the #10 edition. If the amount
      does not cover the cost of mailing pray let me know I will send it. Hope you will
      write your name in the volumes.
   </p> 
   <p>Hear of you occasionally through Mr. Dowden. You may suppose that I often dwell with
      pleasure upon that little [
      <span class="unclear">work?</span>]
       I paid you in Washington now nearly 4 years ago.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish you could see all the people—all the free young men, and pure women—here who
      take pleasure in &amp; have received life &amp; light from your books—
      
      Not that they are very numerous, but I think you would take grater pleasure from the
      kind of people who care for you than the number
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish you cd have been at, or that I could be pictured to you, a meeting of a literary society
      I attended last Monday evening where a "gentleman" made a most ignorant &amp; savage attack
      on your writings. I wish you cd have heard Professor Dowdens reply—I wish you could have seen how his beautifully spiritual face lighted up as
      he proceeded—and leading intelligently &amp; with feelings the very same pages from your
      works which the lecturer (a coarse Man of the world) had read as words—make all clear
      &amp; beautiful where was before
      
      coarse [
      <span class="unclear">workings?</span>]
      . I must say that I only know Mr Dowden casually—a person of my world cannot aspire
      to much acquaintance with a man whom I know to be so much in advance of me in every
      respect. My knowledge of literature is very High—I have not the critical insight into
      things that he has
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear friend, I am sorry to hear of your not being well. Is there no chance of our
      ever seeing you at [illegible]? I hope I will again see you in any case. Life appears to me [
      <span class="unclear">increasingly?</span>]
       beautiful &amp; interesting—I feel increasingly tender towards all living creatures.
      My having been
      
      
      
      
      obliged to give up all idea of a separate life for myself beyond the grave, forces
      me more &amp; more &amp; more to do what little good I can in this world—convinces me more
      that (beyond our animal [
      <span class="unclear">necessities?</span>]
      ) spiritual life, that truth, that intercourse with the pure hearted amongst us here—is
      the only life really worth living—I must not exclude the pure joys of nature—the [illegible], the mountain top, and the forest.
   </p>

      Ever yours affectionately
      <br></br>&gt;With best wishes
