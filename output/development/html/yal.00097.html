   <p>I assume that Poetry in America needs to be entirely recreated. On examining with
      anything like deep analysis what now prevails in the United States, the whole mass
      of current poetical works, long and short, consists either of the poetry of an elegantly
      weak sentimentalism, at bottom nothing but maudlin puerilities, more or less musical
      in verbiage, arising out of a life of depression and enervation, and producing depression
      and enervation as their result;—or else that class of poetry, plays, &amp;c, of which
      the foundation is feudalism, with its ideas of lords and ladies, its imported standards
      of gentility, and the manners of European high-life-below-stairs in every line and
      verse. Such to me is the existing condition of poetry; such the product of the poets
      and poems of the time. To me, nothing can be more utterly contemptible. Instead of
      mighty and vital breezes, proportionate to our continent, with its powerful races
      of men, its tremendous historic events, its great oceans, its mountains and its illimitable
      prairies, I find a few little silly fans languidly moved by shrunken fingers. [My
      ambition is] to give something to our literature which will be our own; with neither
      foreign spirit, nor imagery nor form, but adapted to our case, grown out of our associations,
      boldly portraying the West, strengthening and intensifying the national soul, and
      finding the entire fountains of its birth and growth in our own country.<sup><a href="#yal.00097_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived with
      William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later John
      Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington years.
      William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor often complained about the
      various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his death. However, his
      government work was relieved by the presence of Whitman, whom he was to love and
      venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
      vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
      pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
      important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
      those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
      O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
      sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
      first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910], 513). For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see Deshae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00097_n1">1. Sometime during 1866,
      O'Connor sent to Moncure D. Conway a "Memoranda" (Yale), in which he quoted from
      Whitman's letter, and commented on the poet's life and works. Conway used this
      material in his article "Walt Whitman," <em>The Fortnightly
         Review</em>, 6 (1866), 538–548. Whitman undoubtedly wrote to O'Connor
      with publication in mind.<a href="#r1">[back]
