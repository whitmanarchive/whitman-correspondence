      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your favor came duly to hand.  We send you by Express to-day <em>prepaid</em> care of Mr. Clapp of Spruce St—12 copies of the Leaves<sup><a href="#loc.00576_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>. We have had none bound in dark cloths yet his shall have in the next edition<sup><a href="#loc.00576_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>. The first edition is nearly all gone, and the second is all printed and ready for
      binding.
   </p>
   
   <p>We do not think that this Summer is the time to commence a rigorous and systematic
      course of advertising. As soon as cooler weather comes and people are crowding the
      great cities we intend to advertise largely both by circular, porters, and the press.
      We shall however do considerable advertising this summer. We have concocted a plan
      by which we hope to give the Imprints a very wide and telling circulation, and which
      we shall put into action immediately<sup><a href="#loc.00576_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>. If you will look in the next number of Frank Leslie, an advertisement headed "a
      Good Book given away" will explain what we mean<sup><a href="#loc.00576_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>. This we intend to have go in as an Editorial Advertisement to nearly every paper
      in the Country, and keep it certainly in. This ought to give us a very large lot of
      mail orders, and we think that the mail will be a larger customer than all the Trade
      put together at least for the present.<sup><a href="#loc.00576_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      <em>There</em> is considerable opposition among the trade to the book. Brown &amp; Taggard the largest
      jobbers in Boston to Country booksellers, refuse to supply the orders for it and will
      not buy a copy<sup><a href="#loc.00576_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup>. C. N. Lee tho still hold out, and sell all they can.  The rest of the trade sell what they are obliged to, but cannot be induced to urge
      it any—of course we intend to conquer this opposition partly born of prejudices and
      partly of cowardice, by creating an overwhelming demand among the main public, which
      shall sweep them and their petty fears, on its resistless torrent.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have sent such an advertisement as you hear of to the N.Y. Tribune—for a standing
      notice.
   </p>
   
   <p>We shall shortly come out with an advertisement to touch the pleasure travellers in
      all the principal cities—<sup><a href="#loc.00576_n8" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Meanwhile the Papers are noticing it pretty well—the Scottish American has a very
      fair notice, and we get some almost every day. We received the N.Y. Mercury with the
      allusion of Ada Isaacs Menken Heenan, and think it a good indication that the book
      is reaching the lower strata<sup><a href="#loc.00576_n9" id="r8">8</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>In regard to the contract, we desire that it should be fixed as early as possible. We don't know what accidents may happen
      in this life, and a matter of that kind should not go without being determined.
   </p>
   
   <p>We sent the books to England a long while ago.—a day or two after you left Boston.
      Shall we send your oil portrait back?<sup><a href="#loc.00576_n10" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Should like to hear from you soon. Our shop fellows all send their best remembrances
      to you—Mrs. Thayer desires to be remembered also.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thayer and Eldridge was
      the Boston publishing firm responsible for the third edition of Walt Whitman's
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00576_n2">1. Henry Clapp
      (1814–1875) Jr., was a journalist, editor and reformer. Whitman and Clapp
      most likely met in Charles Pfaff's beer cellar, located in lower Manhattan.
      Clapp, who founded the literary weekly the <em>Saturday Press</em>
      in 1858, was instrumental in promoting Whitman's poetry and celebrity; over
      twenty items on Whitman appeared in the <em>Press</em> before the
      periodical folded (for the first time) in 1860. Of Clapp Whitman told Horace
      Traubel, "You will have to know something about Henry Clapp if you want to know
      all about me." (For Whitman's thoughts on Clapp, see <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/Walt WhitmanWiC/1/med.00001.60.html">Sunday, May 27, 1888</a>.")<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00576_n3">2. For the 1860 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> Whitman abandoned the green binding used
      for the 1855 and 1856 editions. Instead, Whitman had his third edition bound in
      several different bindings ranging from yellowish brown to reddish orange to
      purple. For a discussion of the significance of this color change see Ed
      Folsom's <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">

   <p id="loc.00576_n4">3. 
      <em>Leaves of Grass Imprints</em>, a free, sixty-four-page
      promotional pamphlet published by Thayer and Eldridge to advertise the 1860
      edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. <em>Imprints</em> includes a unique mixture of promotional material including
      positive and negative reviews of the 1855 and 1856 <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> and even reports of Whitman abandoning poetry to drive an
      omnibus. For a brief description of <em>Imprints</em> see Ed
