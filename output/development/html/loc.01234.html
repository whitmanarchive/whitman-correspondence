      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have, yesterday, transmitted to you through the Post Office an order for £1. It
      is from a friend of mine, <br><br>Charles. G. Oates<br>Meanwoodside<br>Leeds and he desires me to ask you to send him a copy of your volume
      
      
      'The Two Rivulets'.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am reading your Memoranda &amp;c of the war with great interest. How wonderful that
      drama of the world enacting itself—that drama of the death of Feudalism, as you call
      it I think, and of the birth of Democracy—&amp; Lincoln dying in the birth! and to see
      it enacted through individuals whom you wd. love &amp; hold by the hand, themselves
      
      
      unconscious—with their clear unsearchable eyes and hidden dramas of their own.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The sense of 'unearthliness' is somehow fused with Democracy, I think.</p>
   
   
   <p>I hope you will get pretty well set up this summer. I was glad to hear you were better.
      The second pair of your volumes has not arrived for me, up to this date.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours, as ever,
      <br></br>E. Carpenter.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
