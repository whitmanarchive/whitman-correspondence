   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05823_n1">1. Early in June, Bartlett
      wrote to Whitman for his autograph, and received in reply a printed card
      advertising an autographed edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> for
      $3; the card and envelope as well as Bartlett's notation are in the Clifton
      Waller Barrett Collection, University of Virginia. On June 10 Bartlett sent the
      money for the book (The Library of Congress), which on the following day Whitman
      sent to Chicopee Falls, Mass. (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
