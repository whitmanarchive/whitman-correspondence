       Ticknor has informed you that the Osgood &amp; Co: plates of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> now in your charge have been transferred to

   <p>Will you please prepare for me for casting a new title page, the copy for which is
      herewith enclosed—As it is a small job, could you make up (I should say in the
      same long primer as book, but I leave it to Mr Clark's<sup><a href="#wau.00002_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      taste), &amp; send the proof of it to me by next Monday night's mail—as I am
      waiting for new titles for 225 copies I have in sheets, &amp; have an order for<sup><a href="#wau.00002_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Will return proof immediately with word how many I
      want printed.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="wau.00002_n1">1. Whitman noted in his
      Commonplace Book this letter to Rand &amp; Avery, the firm which had printed the
      1860 and Osgood editions (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On June 8
      Whitman sent "corrections" to the firm and "ordered 1000 copies printed," but
      the order was later "countermanded" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Evidently Rand
      &amp; Avery refused to run off the edition because of fears of legal action. On
      July 24 Whitman paid Rand &amp; Avery $13.75, presumably for the corrections
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="wau.00002_n2">2. Ticknor, for Osgood &amp;
      Co., on May 19 instructed Rand &amp; Avery to hold the plates for Whitman
      (Whitman's copy of the letter is in the Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="wau.00002_n4">4. On the same day Whitman
      "sent order to Sanborn, Boston, to send the 225 sets sheets to James Arnold"
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Arnold, who had his plant at 531 Chestnut Street
      in Philadelphia, had bound the 1876 edition.<a href="#r4">[back]
