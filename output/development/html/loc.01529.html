      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your welcome letter of Aug. 27th—and also 31st, enclosing Ned 
      Stewarts
      
      <sup><a href="#loc.01529_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—When you write tell Ned I am here in Brooklyn,
      loafing around—&amp; that I send my love. Pete, there is nothing particular to write
      about this time—pretty much the same story—every day out on the bay awhile, or
      going down to Coney Island beach—and every day from two to four or five hours in the
      printing office—I still keep well &amp; hearty, &amp; the weather is fine—warm
      through the middle of the day, &amp; cool mornings &amp; nights—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I fall in with quite a good many of my acquaintances of years ago<sup><a href="#loc.01529_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—the young fellows, (now not so young)—that I knew intimately here before the
      war—some are dead—&amp; some have got married—&amp; some have grown
      rich—one of the latter I was up with yesterday &amp; last night—he has a big
      house on Fifth avenue—I was there to dinner (dinner at 8 p. m.!)—every thing in
      the loudest sort of style, with wines, silver, nigger waiters, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. But
      my friend is just one of the manliest, jovialest best sort of fellows—no
      airs—&amp; just the one to suit you &amp; me—no women in the house—he is
      single—he wants me to make my home there—I shall not do that, but shall go there
      very frequently—the dinners &amp; good wines are attractive—then there is a fine
      library. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, Pete, I am on the second month of my furlough—to think it is almost six weeks
      since we parted there that night—My dear loving boy, how much I want to see
      you—it seems a long while—I have rec'd a good letter from Mr. O'Connor,<sup><a href="#loc.01529_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; also one from John Rowland<sup><a href="#loc.01529_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> who
      is in the office for me. Nothing new in office—Well, Pete, about half our separation
      is over—the next six weeks will soon pass away—indeed it may be only four, as
      John Rowland told me he might wish to go away—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Good bye for the present, my loving son, &amp; give my respects to any of the boys that
      ask
      about me.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01529_n1">1. This piece of correspondence is addressed,
      "Peter Doyle | Conductor | Office | Wash. &amp; Georgetown City RR. Co. |
      Washington, | D. C." It is postmarked: "New-York | Sep | 2 | 6:30 P.M."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01529_n2">2. Probably Edward C. Stewart, who wrote to
      Whitman on . Walt Whitman also
      referred to him in an address book (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt
      Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #109).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01529_n3">3. Walt Whitman referred to the "Fred Gray
      association"; see Whitman's  letter to Nathaniel Bloom and John F. S. Gray. According to the
      New York Directory of 1870–1871, Charles H. Russell lived at 417 Fifth
      Avenue. Russell's occupation was not cited, and he was not listed in the
      following year.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01529_n4">4. Not extant.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01529_n5">5. A clerk in the Attorney General's office,
      who substituted for Whitman while he was on leave. (Rowland is also mentioned in
      Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman.) On September 24, 1870, Rowland received through A. J. Falls
      $50, "on account, for service as substitute for Walt Whitman." A later receipt,
      dated October 18, 1870, and prepared by Walt Whitman himself after his return to
      Washington, read: "Received from W. W. seventy dollars additional, making One
      hundred &amp; twenty dollars—in full of all demands" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r5">[back]
