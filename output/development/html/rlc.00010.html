      <br></br>Dear friend—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of April 4 has come to hand—with picture, which I prize<sup><a href="#rlc.00010_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—you speak of Mr. Elster's<sup><a href="#rlc.00010_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      criticism—when it comes I shall have it carefully translated to me—if you
      communicate with him, please give him my serious thanks &amp; good will—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>All your <em>papers</em>, copies of <em>D. Fremblik</em> &amp;
      your <em>letters</em> have reached me safely in the past—(also the large
      <em>photo</em>. by poor Clausen<sup><a href="#n0163" id="r4">4</a></sup>.) Did you receive <em>Redwood Tree</em><sup><a href="#n0578" id="r5">5</a></sup> in Harper's Magazine<sup><a href="#n0290" id="r6">6</a></sup>—&amp; <em>Prayer of Columbus</em><sup><a href="#n0482" id="r7">7</a></sup>—sent some weeks (March 4)
      since? <em>This piece</em> of C. Petersen is in the May <em>Galaxy</em>,<sup><a href="#rlc.00010_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup> a New York Monthly. I will make inquiry about
      Petersen, &amp; if I see him or find out I will duly write you. I am not well yet—far
      from it—but live in hopes—

   <p>John Burroughs visited me for two days lately<sup><a href="#rlc.00010_n4" id="r9">9</a></sup>—He is
      well, is married, (36 years old), has left Washington, &amp; has settled on a little farm
      with horse, cows, &amp; fowls on the banks of the Hudson river, 60 miles from New York,
      his native state &amp; mine. I am to go there the coming summer. J. B. is a most natural,
      homely, good man—(like an <em>apple–tree</em>, or <em>pine</em>, or a good <em>field</em> of <em>wheat</em>—yet thoroughly human)<sup><a href="#rlc.00010_n5" id="r10">10</a></sup>—has a nice

      To–day
      
       is dark &amp; rainy here—spring very backward here—I sit here in the

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0793">1. Rudolf Schmidt, a Dane and
      editor of <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em>, is credited with
      introducing Walt Whitman to Scandinavia by quoting translated passages from <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in a 1872 essay in his magazine. He wrote
      to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871:
      "I intend to write
      an article about yourself and your writings in the above named periodical which
      is very much read in all the Scandinavian countries. ... I therefore take the
      liberty to ask you, if you should not be willing to afford some new
      communications of yourself and your poetry to this purpose" (The Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="rlc.00010_n1">2. This picture, now in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C., appears in Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.20.html">2:84</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00010_n2">3. On , Schmidt described a critical article composed by a young
      Norwegian named Kristian Elster, who had expressed "a great fear that the editor
      (in Christiania) would not print it. In the war, on the roaring sea the
      Norwegians are a people of heroes; but in their civil and literary life they are
      a race of cowards." According to Roos, Elster (1841–1881) was a friend of
      Björnson; see <em>Orbis Litterarum</em>, 7 (1949),
      51n.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0163">4. Carl F. Clausen, who Rudolf Schmidt called "my old
      friend and countryman," corresponded with Schmidt after he left Denmark in 1860.
      See <em>Orbis Litterarum</em>, VII (1949), 34–39. The
      Directory in 1870 listed him as a draughtsman and in 1872 as a patent agent. He
      died of consumption in the middle 1870s; see The Library of Congress #
      108.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0578">5. In a ,
      letter, Walt Whitman offered "Song of the Redwood-Tree" to Henry M. Alden,
      editor of <em>Harper's Monthly Magazine</em>. Of "Song of the
      Redwood-Tree" Rudolf Schmidt observed: "It is your old great theme in a simple
      and powerful stile, embracing the holy and original nation of the far West"
      (Syracuse University; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], 4:464). For digital images of the poem as it
      appeared in <em>Harper's Monthly Magazine</em>, see "."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0290">6. <em>Harper's Monthly Magazine</em>
      (sometimes <em>Harper's New Monthly Magazine</em> or simply <em>Harper's</em>) was established in 1850 by Henry J. Raymond and
      Fletcher Harper. The magazine published several of Walt Whitman's poems,
      including "" and "." In 1857, Fletcher Harper founded <em>Harper's Weekly</em> (subtitled "A Journal of Civilization"),
      which gained its fame for its coverage of the Civil War and its publication of
      cartoonist Thomas Nast's (1840–1902) work. For Whitman's relationship with
      these two publications, see "" and "."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0482">7. Having successfully submitted "Song of the
      Redwood-Tree" to <em>Harper's New Monthly Magazine</em> on , Walt Whitman submitted a second
      poem, "Prayer of Columbus," later in , also for $60. Editor Henry Mills Alden (1836–1919) accepted
      the poem on  (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection); it appeared in the March 1874 edition, XLVIII (1874),
      524–525. In reprinting the poem on February 24, 1874, the New York <em>Tribune</em> commented that it "shows the brawny vigor, but
      not the reckless audacity, by which the name of that wild poet has become best
      known to the public." For digital images of the poem as it appeared in <em>Harper's New Monthly Magazine</em>, see "."<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="rlc.00010_n4">9. Whitman also wrote about Burroughs's visit in
      his  letter to Peter Doyle.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
