   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00620_n1">1. This letter dates to March
      1, 1873. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter February 28, 1873, but February
      28 did not fall on Saturday, the day in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, in the
      year 1873. Edwin Haviland Miller dated the letter March 1, 1873 (Walt Whitman,
      <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77], 2:370), and Miller's date, which did fall on Saturday, is
      correct. Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's death on February 19 was very recent
      at the time of this letter, and three letters that Louisa had received date this
      letter to Saturday, March 1. February 22 can be eliminated as a possibility
      because Louisa had received a letter from Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, and
      Jeff described his February 24, 1873 letter to his mother as the first he had
      written since Mattie's death (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson
         Whitman</em>, [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984], 158). Louisa
      described Jeff's letter as a "long one" with "the particulars of matties death,"
      and that description is consistent with Jeff's February 24, 1873 letter.
      Louisa's letter also acknowledges Walt's payment for Edward Whitman's board, the
      $20 that he promised to send within two or three days of his  letter. Finally, Louisa
      paraphrases two lines from granddaughter Manahatta Whitman's  letter (Feinberg Collection,
      Library of Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00615_n6">3. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00620_n5">4. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. Walt had promised to send $20 for Edward's board a few
      days earlier (see his  letter to
      Louisa).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00614_n8">6. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman died on February 19, 1873 from complications associated with a throat
      ailment. Mattie and her husband Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman had two
      daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved
      to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
      emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa. For more on Mattie,
      see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha
         Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      1–26. Waldron reports that a physician identified the cause of death as
      cancer (3). Robert Roper has speculated that Mattie's accompanying bronchial
      symptoms may have been associated with tuberculosis (<em>Now the
         Drum of War</em> [New York: Walker, 2008], 78–79).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00620_n8">7. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman (1833–1890) in his letter provided details about the day of
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's death. The day was pleasant, so Jeff
      planned to take her out. He placed her in a buggy: she collapsed and died
      later that evening (see Jeff's February 24, 1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman, in Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em>, [Kent,
      Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984], 158–61).<br><br>
      Jeff Whitman was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman,
      Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he worked as a
      surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working for the
      Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil War.
      In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. He married wife Martha
      Mitchell (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," in 1859, and Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman had shared their Brooklyn residence until Jeff departed for
      St. Louis. Mattie and her two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa, joined
      Jeff in St. Louis in early 1868. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00440_n3">8. Manahatta Whitman
      (1860–1886), known as "Hattie," was the daughter of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven years of her life in
      the same home with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was especially close to her
      grandmother. Hattie and her younger sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957) were
      both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r8">[back]
