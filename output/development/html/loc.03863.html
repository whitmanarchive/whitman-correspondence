      I hear from Herbert<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; his picture. Also Dr B.<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r5">5</a></sup> Harry<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r6">6</a></sup> was here 4 or 5 days ago. Backward

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan and George Stafford
      were the parents of Whitman's young friend, Harry Stafford. Whitman often
      visited the family at their farm at Timber Creek in Laurel Springs (near
      Glendale), New Jersey, and was sometimes accompanied by Herbert Gilchrist; in
      the 1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby Glendale. For more,
      see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Glendale on Sunday, April 29, and dined with the Harneds in the evening (<em>The Commonplace Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">4. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0590">6. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
