   <p>I did not write you yesterday—had a couple of men here to look at meter and
      Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; myself were with them all day. One of them a big
      capitalist and manufacturer from Montreal. No definite announcement made with
      them—and may not be—but they were pretty impressed by the meter and I
      expect they will make us a proposition. Our fine weather left us right in the middle
      of fair week—i.e. last week has got very cold dark &amp; dull all at once, <u>rains</u> more or less every day—altogether dismal  decidedly—I am
      looking out anxiously for "N.B."<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; "C.W."<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r4">4</a></sup> hope to get the first any how this
      week and the other next week at latest. Johnston has written me<sup><a href="#loc.07250_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> for a likeness of
      myself to be used in an article on "Walt and his friends" Have not had one taken for
      years—shall go in tomorrow (if all well) and have one done—shall of
      course send you a copy—Maurice<sup><a href="#n4174" id="r6">6</a></sup>" goes to Toronto in morning to college again. I
      shall have to get at my lectures on "mental diseases" for the students at medical
      college here as soon as possible—meanwhile I have not more than half written
      "Annual Report." Such is life!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07250_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: LONDON | AM | OC 1 | 88 | CANADA; CAMDEN [illegible] | OCT | 2 | 12PM | 1888 | REC'D.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n4284">2. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="n3999">3. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">4. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07250_n2">5. When Whitman received this
      letter, he mistakenly thought Bucke was referring to Whitman's Philadelphia
      friend J. H. Johnston and was mystified since he had not heard about such a
      project (see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>), but in fact Bucke is probably referring
      to the British disciple, Dr. John Johnston, whose "Notes of Visit to Walt
      Whitman and His Friends in 1890" (finally published in 1917) contained a
      portrait of Bucke; Johnston began corresponding with Whitman in 1887 and began
      planning a trip to the U.S. to visit the poet and his friends.<a href="#r5">[back]
