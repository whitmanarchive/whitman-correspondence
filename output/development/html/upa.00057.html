   </p>
   
   <p>I think of you very often, &amp; cannot but trust your illness is less gloomy than
      Herbert states it—I know I have myself felt convinced several times during the
      last twelve or thirteen years of serious conditions &amp; finálés that
      endurance has tided over—&amp; O I so hope that you will surmount
      all—&amp; that we may yet meet each other face to face.
   </p>
   
   <p>—I am middling well—the trouble in my eyesight (&amp; very annoying it was to my
      <u>anchor'd</u> condition) seems to have pass'd over—We
      are having extremely cold weather here, &amp; I do not get out of the
      house—but it is bright &amp; sunny as I look out—I wrote a card to
      Herbert three days ago, which I suppose he has rec'd—God's peace &amp; blessing
      to you, beloved friend—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
