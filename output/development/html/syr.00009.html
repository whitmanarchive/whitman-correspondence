      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dr Bucke says you talk of going home with him: if you do be sure you stop &amp; see me
      on the way. We have a girl now &amp; are well fixed for the winter. Why not come on
      &amp; stay here till Dr Bucke is ready to go back? I was in 
      N.Y.
      
      
      a couple of weeks ago,
      &amp; saw Arnold at
      
      
      
      Gilder's houseâ€”liked him better than I expected, looks coarse &amp; strong &amp;
      healthy, has a sort of husky voice like a sea captain, looked as if he came from a
      bigger stronger race than the other persons in the room, no pride, or "manners" or
      "culture" visible in him. I found he knew of me &amp; was very cordial in meeting
      me. Liked him much better than the other Englishmen I have seen. Wish you could see
      him &amp; have a good sit down talk with him, I think he is honest &amp; sincere, &amp;
      not too sure about things in this country.
      
      
      
      The idea of his lecture on numbers, namely, that the majority is unsound, is to be
      taken with
      many qualifications &amp; I wish some one would answer it in a mild friendly way. From
      some
      points of view the majority may appear in the wrong, but from other very important
      ones they are in the right, especially modern majorities. The mass of men are
      no longer capable of being gulled &amp; duped and victimized as they were once. A shrewd
      common sense, that extends to big things as well as to little is characteristic of
      the people in this age. If the masses were essentially unsound
      
      
      
      the prophet &amp; the wise man would have only a barren soil to work on. I wish you
      would feel moved to write a short essay in The Critic on the subject. I enjoyed much
      your paper in this weeks number. I think that both Arnold &amp; Carlyle
      detach &amp; see out of its due relations, this idea of the unsoundness of the
      masses. I have written a short sketch as the result of my sea-shore sojourn, for the
      Boston "Wheelman" a new magazine of outdoor literature. I will send you the proof
      for suggestions &amp; revision, especially the part that relates to you
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Eldridge writes me that O'Connor is ill &amp; at the Sulphur Springs of 
      Va. What do you know about him? Eldridge thinks that my publishers are dealing
      honestly with me. I have asked to see their accounts, &amp; they are willing, but
      probably I shall not go on these. When one of my books was published they sold the
      first 6 months 733 copies. When the next book came out, they sold in the same time
      733 copies. Of another 
      vol.
      
       they sold 131 copies in 6 
      mo:
      
       the next 6 
      mo, they sold 131 copies of
      
      
      
      the 
      vol
      
       published next. These coincidences seem almost incredible. I called their
      attention to them, &amp; they reply that they are merely coincidences. Osgood would
      gladly undertake my books; so would Dodd Mead &amp; Co of 
      N.Y.
      
       Fine day here to-day, but have had a cold windy week. Out home in Roxbury I
      tramped over the mountains in blinding snow &amp; cold. I hope you keep well. Send me
      the Scottish Review article if you have it &amp; I will return it.
