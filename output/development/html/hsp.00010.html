      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sirs<sup xmlns=""><a href="#hsp.00010_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of 16th 
      rec'd—Although delayed from calling upon you by one or two little
      matters, I still entertain your proposals—I have had several—For one
      point I should like some publishing &amp; radiating spot near my own
      locality—for another to retain control of my book &amp; personally advise in
      selling &amp; publishing it—Will call upon you Monday 
      bet'n
      
       11 and
      12—
   </p>

   <p>What would you say to entering decidedly into the publishing field? Haven't you
      thought of it? I want to publish my <em>Prose writings</em> in a
      companion volume to L of G—Then there is a Canada man who has a
      book—"<em>Walt Whitman—a Study</em>"<sup><a href="#hsp.00010_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—(Osgood &amp; Co: had the MS. &amp; would
      doubtless have issued it but for the flurry.)—Making <em>three Volumes</em> that ought to go out together, from the same house &amp;
      hands—
   </p>
   
   <p>How would it suit you to get up <em>this three-fold team</em> &amp;
      dash into the fall publishing trade?
   </p>
