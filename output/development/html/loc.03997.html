      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy Harry
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I sent you a few lines three days ago, but I will write again as I have just 
      rec'd
      
      
      yours of 26—a little wild &amp; nervous &amp; uncertain some parts, (but I am
      always glad to get any letters from you dear boy)—Harry, you certainly know
      well enough you have my best honorable loving friendship settled—Of the past I
      think only of the comforting soothing things of it all—I go back to the times
      at Timber Creek beginning most five years ago, &amp; the banks &amp; spring, &amp;
      my hobbling down the old lane—&amp; how I took a good turn there &amp;
      commenced to get slowly but surely better, healthier, stronger—Dear Hank I
      realize plainly that <u>if I had not known you</u>—if it
      hadn't been for you &amp; our friendship &amp; my going down there summers to the
      creek with you—and living there with your folks, &amp; the kindness of your
      mother, &amp; cheering me up—I believe <u>I should not be a
         living man to-day</u>—I think &amp; remember deeply these things &amp;
      they comfort me—<u>&amp; you my darling boy are the central
         figure of them all</u>—
   </p>
   
   <p>—Of the occasional ridiculous little storms &amp; squalls of the past I have quite
      discarded them from my memory<sup><a href="#loc.03997_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—&amp; I hope you
      will too—the other recollections overtop them altogether, &amp; occupy the
      only permanent place in my
      heart—as a manly loving friendship for you does also, &amp;
      will while life lasts—Harry 
      dont
      
      
      be discouraged by any business or other
      disappointments of the past—It will all turn out right—The main thing,
      in my opinion, after finding out as much as possible of life, &amp; entering upon it
      (it is a strange mixed business this life) is to live a good square one—This I
      believe you are really anxious to do, &amp; God bless you in it, &amp; you shall
      have all the help I can give—Your loving ever-faithful old friend &amp;
      comrade

   <p>I think I am slowly getting over my chill—it is rainy, dark, muggy day,
      &amp; I am staying in—had a nice call from a young Beverley merchant Mr
      Hovey<sup><a href="#loc.03997_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> yesterday, he 
      bo't
      
       a set of
      books—Did you know young Harry Bonsall<sup><a href="#loc.03997_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> is
      &amp; has been some time in the Insane Asylum at Blackwoodtown?—I was out to
      dinner yesterday to Mr &amp; Mrs Scovel's—turkey and champagne!—but
      that is the only spree for me in five weeks—
   </p>
   
   <p>Hank I want you to acknowledge this letter—I hope this won't fail to reach
      you like some others I have sent—I want to come down before long &amp;
      then we will have some good square talks—it is now half past 4 &amp; I see
      the sun is going to set clear<sup><a href="#loc.03997_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>
