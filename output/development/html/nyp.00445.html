   <p>The <em>worry</em> of Ruskin<sup><a href="#nyp.00445_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—he has at various times sent to me
      for six sets of my ($10, two 
      Vol.) centennial Edition<sup><a href="#nyp.00445_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—&amp; sent the money
      for them—with <em>Leaves of Grass</em> is that they are <em>too personal</em>, too emotional, launched from the fires of <em>myself</em>, my spinal passions, joys, yearnings, doubts,
      appetites &amp;c &amp;c.—which is really what the book is mainly for, (as a
      type however for those passions, joys, workings &amp;c <em>in all the
         race</em>, at least as shown under modern &amp; especially American
      auspices)—Then I think he winces at what seems to him the <em>Democratic</em> brag of L. of G.—I have heard from R several times
      through English visitor friends of his—It is quite certain that he has
      intended writing to me at length—&amp; has doubtless made draughts of such
      writing—but defers &amp; <em>fears</em>—&amp; has not yet
      written—R like a true Englishman evidently believes in the high poetic art of
      (only) making abstract works, poems, of some fine plot or subject, stirring,
      beautiful, very noble, completed within their own centre &amp; radius, &amp; nothing
      to do with the poet's special personality, nor exhibiting the least trace of
      it—like 
      
      Shakspere's
       great unsurpassable dramas. But I have dashed at <em>the
         greater drama going on within myself &amp; every human being—that is what
         I have been after</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00445_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—

   <p>P.S. William, (as you seem to be 
      destin'd
      
       to defend the banner) I say here once for all you have my permission to
      make any extracts, at any time, should you so like from any of my letters—

   <p id="nyp.00445_n3">3. O'Connor disagreed with
      Whitman's evaluation of Ruskin in a letter dated : "I was very much touched with what Ruskin wrote, which
      seemed to me to be very strongly on your side. . . . It seems a great thing to
      say, as Ruskin does, that your book 'is deadly true—in the sense of
      rifles—against our deadliest social sins'—and also that its fruit is
      'ungatherable save by loving and gleaning hands, <em>and by the
         blessed ones of the poor</em>.' I understand this as a high
      endorsement."<a href="#r3">[back]
