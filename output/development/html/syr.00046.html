   <p>Your card of 26<u>th</u> to hand this morning.<sup><a href="#syr.00046_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I grieve much that you should be depressed and by me
      about O'C.<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r3">3</a></sup> but I am anxious that his possible death at any time
      should not take you unawares for if it did I fear it [would] be a terrible shock to
      you. [—] Weather here bright and colder, very pleasant—We keep all
      well—nothing new with us. [—] I have had quite a time the last few days
      arranging and posting recent additions to my W. W. Collection. It is growing rapidly
      and assuming very considerable proportions. Nothing new about the meter Willy
      Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r4">4</a></sup> still here—he is waiting for Nesbit<sup><a href="#n4153" id="r5">5</a></sup> (our other
      partner) who should have been here to consult long ago but does not come for some
      reason

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4284">4. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
