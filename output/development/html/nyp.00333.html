   <p>It will be very easy to come here—get out at West Philadelphia &amp; come down in Market st. 
      horse cars to ferry, foot of Market st—cross to Camden, it is only 1/3d of a mile from ferry. 
      Send me word a day ahead &amp; I will meet you at West Philadelphia. We have plenty of room. 
      Come whenever convenient. You will find me much better—to-day I feel like getting well, 
      (&amp; confidently expect to)—wish you were here to-day—'twould be most like old times—
   </p>
