      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>If no more raids, invasions, incursions, no more new developments in the Ginnaty affair,
      no more detentions by fire or water occur, my plan is to leave at 6:30 to-morrow evening.<sup><a href="#loc.00944_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup> I shall get into New York about an hour later than usual, &amp; put my baggage upon the
      Stonington Boat to leave
      <em>that Wednesday evening</em>
      and I shall in on the boat in good time, it leaves at 5 P.M. &amp; I will be there by
      <em>three</em>
      P.M. I can say, unless the omnibus that takes me down town should smash up, or something
      like it. So if you are
      <em>able</em>
      I shall be
      <em>very, very</em>
      glad to see you &amp; have a good talk with you while I wait.
   </p>
   
   <p>
      <em>Don't</em>
      come unless you are able, but if you are I shall rejoice to see you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Of course I do not ask you to meet me when I get in on Tuesday morning because I know it would be too much for
      you, &amp; because Mr. Howells<sup><a href="#loc.00944_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> has said he would, but it would be good to have a whole day with you if you were
      well. I shall go to some place &amp; get a breakfast, &amp; be under Mr. Howells' supervision.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good bye. Charlie<sup><a href="#loc.00944_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> got your last letter. He did hope to get away, but can't.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00944_n100">1. For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
      John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
      years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor, William's wife, had a close personal relationship
      with Whitman. In 1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with William over the
      Fifteenth Amendment, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen
      defended Whitman's opinion, and in response William established a separate
      residence. The correspondence between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous
      as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship
      with the O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00944_n2">2. Charles Joseph Howells,
      according to entries in New York Directories, must have been versatile (and
      perhaps eccentric): in 1864–1865 he was an "inventor," in 1865–1866
      an inspector in the Custom House, in 1866–1867 simply an "inspector," and
      in 1867–1868 a seller of hairpins.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00944_n3">3. Charles W. Eldridge was
      one half of the Boston based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge,
      who put out the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In
      December 1862, on his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg,
      Virginia, Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become
      a clerk in the office of the army paymaster and eventually obtained a desk for
      Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with Thayer and Eldridge see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
