   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00559_n7">1. This letter dates to
      December 10, 1868, which fell on Thursday in 1868. Richard Maurice Bucke
      dated the letter December 10, 1868, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:366). The subjects of this letter are
      consistent with early December 1868, both in the matter of the recent
      amputation of Hannah (Whitman) Heyde's thumb and in the plans by Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha "Mattie" Whitman to depart Brooklyn soon
      for St. Louis without visiting Walt Whitman in Washington.<br><br>
      Louisa enclosed in this letter to Walt a December 1868 letter from Charles
      Heyde that described the surgical amputation of his wife Hannah Heyde's
      thumb (Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint
         Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His
         Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949],
      225–226). Miller dated Heyde's letter to "[a]bout December 8" (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, 2:72–73, n. 37). A
      second point of corroboration for the date of the present letter is Louisa's
      statement that Jeff and Mattie no longer plan to visit Walt in Washington.
      That statement affirms Louisa's observation, in her  letter to Walt, that "i hardly
      think they will come to washington." Indeed, Jeff and Mattie departed for
      St. Louis shortly after this letter (see Louisa's  letter to Walt). Since the letter must
      precede Louisa's December 15–19 letter and since Louisa enclosed
      Heyde's December 8 letter, it must date to the Thursday following Heyde's,
      December 10, 1868.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00559_n13">2. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a French-born landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa
      Whitman (1823–1908), Walt's sister in 1852, and they lived in Burlington,
      Vermont. The letter that Louisa had received, Heyde's December 8?, 1868 letter,
      describes the surgical amputation of Hannah's thumb by Samuel W. Thayer, a
      Vermont physician. See Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman
         and His Family</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949),
      225. Edwin Haviland Miller dated Heyde's letter to "[a]bout December 8" (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], n. 37).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00422_n2">4. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00559_n11">5. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her death in
      February 1873. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York:
