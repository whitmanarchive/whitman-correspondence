      My dearest Friend,
      
      
   </p>  
   
   <p>
      My birthday today. 38. A time rousing many memories, solemn thoughts, &amp; forward reaching
      anticipations. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Most of all, thoughts of my dear mother—"buried &amp; gone, yet buried <u>not</u>, gone 
      <u>not</u> from me." How strongly I have felt that today! I feel somehow that there is indeed
      obscure 
      &amp; deep communion between us, not to be put in words, yet vital &amp; real. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      "Of all earth, life, love
      
      to me the best"—I pledge her dear memory—sacred &amp; precious to me evermore—with 
      <u>you</u>—the supreme lover, my dearest friend, exemplar, &amp; benefactor—as with one who
      also loves his mother's memory above all else.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      May God in due time reunite us <u>there</u>, in love deeper &amp; more stainless than of old. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      How life deepens with advancing years! Miraculous &amp; wonderful beyond all speech, pierced
      through &amp; through with 
      shafts of light as from heaven itself—a deep &amp; mystic love revealing &amp; unfolding itself
      more &amp; more. 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      "Praise the Lord for his goodness!"—That old time ejaculation of psalmist David is
      true in every generation—&amp; 
      may be ours today in even greater measure.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Deep gratitude from my heart to <u>you</u>—dearest of all friends—for all the light &amp; joy 
      &amp;  blessing you have bestowed on me during the last twelve months. You little know
      all you have done for me! But you have 
      my dearest love evermore.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Not only directly, but perhaps even more <u>in</u>directly, you have deepened the Channels of my life, &amp; 
      filled it with courage 
          
      &amp; joy. Old friendships you have deepened, &amp; new &amp; blessed ones have come to me through
      <u>you</u>.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I have had touching proofs of this today. From a full heart I pray God to bless my
      friends, &amp; <u>you</u> 
      their chief. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      This morning I received a letter—short, sweet, &amp; delicate, from our dear friend Johnston<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r2">2</a></sup> enclosing 
      a bank note for <u>£20</u> sent to me by "the College"—to start me to 
      <u>you</u>. (I cannot come yet, but they mean that I <u>shall</u> come when I can.)
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Along with it a letter from Johnston in his own behalf
      
      warm &amp; friendly, &amp; an illustrated copy of his "<u>Notes</u>"—similar to the one he sent to you. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Letters, too, from other friends—swelling my heart with emotions almost painful—my
      dear old friend Fred Wild for 
      instance— &amp; Wentworth Dixon &amp; others. Greenhalgh sent me a book, too, with a note
      in which he says—"I am indebted 
      to you for more than I can say. You have—unconsioucly to yourself—answered questions
      of eternal importance to me."
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Letters, too, from children—two very sweet &amp; loving from Dixon's little girls.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      "I'm a proud man the day"—and I tell <u>you</u> about it, dear friend &amp; master, because 
      I owe so much of it to <u>you</u>. God bless you &amp; reward you. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Some of the friends should have come to Anderton to tea with me—but business &amp; other
      engagements intervened. Johnston 
      however came, and as he had to return soon to his surgery, I came to Bolton again
      with him, &amp; and write this while he is
      professionally engaged. Very soon I shall have to start off for the last train home.
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      We were very sorry to see in tonight's paper that
      
      you have had a spell of terrible heat in the States—96° at Philadelphia. We are very
      much concerned on 
      <u>your</u> account. We shall await reports anxiously.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      My life becomes more &amp; more intertwined with yours. God grant that in the future it
      may grow worthier, &amp; that I may be 
      enabled to devote such energies &amp; powers as are left me more &amp; more to your cause.
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I cannot write any more now.—But today—
      
      even more than usual—my heart goes out to you with love,&amp; blessing &amp; deepest gratitude
      &amp; honour.
      
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
