      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was very glad to have your postcard two or three days ago, + to find that you still
      struggle on so bravely. When your card came, I was staying awhile at a pleasant farm
      near the little town of Brecon, whither I went for the Welsh Eisteddfod. (I send
      paper by this poet, with article of mine giving brief description). Harvest was in
      full swing while I was there, and I had a capital time of it, riding about on a sturdy +
      quick little mare, + getting well sun-burnt. My work—editing +c., made me come
      away at last sooner than I wished to. I left there on Monday,—travelling by
      farmer's gig + train, + then afoot for twelve miles by a good country road through
      a
      quiet + picturesque [illegible] valley,—so reaching this place, Carmarthen, where I
      stay with my grandfather + mother.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Wales has been at its best for the last three of four weeks—splendid harvest
      sunshine day after day; + you may think of me, if you will, as living a free + easy
      life in the sun, having for society the hearty + simple farm folk of South Wales,
      listening with immense
      zest to their folk-songs + folk-tales, which are of a kind that you would like +
      take to heart.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>There is great stone of the antique in Wales, as you know; + it is good on these
      sunny autumn afternoons to climb up to some old castle, and imagine the Medieval
      bands + warriors parading there as of old. I have been dipping more + more into old
      Welsh romance + poetry of late; eking out with a dictionary my small store of the
      vernacular as now spoken. There is great wealth of metaphor, + excessive metrical
      finesse in some of these old Welsh poets. Indeed, Welsh poetry is far more intricate
      + distinctive in its way than the English, while of course wanting in many things that the [illegible] Elizabethans had.
   </p>
   
   <p>I expect to stay in this neighborhood for two or three weeks,—exploring some
      parts of the coast (for the sea is quite near.) + of the country, that I have not
      already come to know. Little by little Wales is becoming a fairly well-known country
      + fatherland, where many hospitable rooftrees serve as a kind of friendly barricade
      against the outer world—if it should be inclined to treat me badly at any
      time. Now defended from the sophistication of life, one can manage to live the
      spirit of "Leaves of Grass,"—a life simple + healthy + very human! But I must
      stop now, for the sun calls me out; + I have already written much to-day.
   </p>
