       be done. All to do now to put on a  few finishing touches—he will be
      here next week the whole thing accomplished—next thing is to see about its
      practical utility &amp; value and how to turn it into cash. It <u>ought</u> to be worth a lot of money—we shall see—it is quite
      possible. I shall have to go East about this business in the course of a month or
      six weeks—in which case I shall of course see you. We are all well and on the

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="n1043">4. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt

      grew up in Mooretown, Upper Canada. She was the daughter of William Gurd, an

      had eight children.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n4284">7. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
