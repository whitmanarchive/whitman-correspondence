   <p>The whole hinge of the Chadwick letter<sup><a href="#nyp.00444_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—involving
      you and yours, with me, &amp; including the question of veracity—seems to me
      to be essentially <em>What are the relations of Emerson to W W</em>?
      As permanently left by <em>the sum</em> of the transactions and
      judgments of twenty-five years—(yours of 29th recd)—(just the same as
      the Bible means its whole &amp; final spirit, not one or two picked out verses or
      texts)—confirmed by a most deliberate and emphatic act of the last year of his
      
      E's
      
       life—seems to me the mood of your reply to the Chadwick letter may well be
      <em>different</em> from the other (which the more I read it, the
      more it unfolds—it is such a piece of <em>literary
         work</em>)<sup><a href="#nyp.00444_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I see clearly that the question
      above is more involved than that of veracity you speak of—see the other page I
      send—
   </p>
   
   <p>Personal information—perhaps nothing but what you knew already—</p>
   
   <p>☞ I suppose you know that the <em>Life of
         Emerson</em>—(&amp; a very good one I guess)—published nearly a year ago
      by Osgood—<em>all with the sanction &amp; revision of the family
         &amp; of 
         E.
         
          himself</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00444_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—gives <em>in full the letter
         of 1856 you quote</em>—thus confirming &amp; sanctioning it—See said
      <em>Life</em>.<sup><a href="#nyp.00444_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Seems to me would be good to bring in quite verbatim—it is certainly
      <em>true</em>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Emerson had much more of a personal friendship for W W than has been generally known;
      making a determined visit to Brooklyn soon after the appearance of Leaves of Grass,
      twenty five years ago, walking out to the little cottage in the suburbs, several
      miles from the ferry where Mr W then lived. From that time regularly for years
      afterwards whenever he came to New York he appointed a meeting, and they two
      generally dined together and spent some hours.<sup><a href="#nyp.00444_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> When Mr
      Whitman was in Boston in 1860 Emerson was his frequent &amp; cordial visitor. As
      time elapsed, though officious persons intervened, and there was a lull of some
      years, I doubt if it could be said that Ralph Waldo Emerson's affections (and few
      know how deeply he could love!) ever went out more warmly to any one, and remained
      more fixed, under the circumstances, than toward Walt Whitman.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr Chadwick evidently thinks that if the author of Leaves of Grass had any case to
      state, that walk on the common in 1860 was his time. But it is well known to his
      intimate friends that Walt Whitman, who has the most simplicity and good nature of
      any man alive, is also the haughtiest, the most disdainful at those periods when
      expected to talk loudest and best, and when he probably could do so, is apt to
      remain perfectly silent. The main reason certainly was, curious as it may seem, that
      Emerson's objections, on that famous walk, did not at all touch Whitman's principle
      of treatment which was a moral one, or rather it involved the verteber of all
      morals. I have heard the author of Leaves of Grass say that what he sought to do in
      "Children of Adam" seemed all the more necessary after that [conversation?]. Though
      Emerson's points were of the highest and keenest order, they sprang exclusively from
      conventional and what may be called the usual technical literary considerations. I
      know from what he has told me that Whitman himself had long dwelt on these very
      points in his own mind—that he was anxious to hear the utmost that could be
      brought forward in their behalf. And now when he heard what the best critic of the
      age so brought forward, and his inmost soul and brain remained altogether untouched,
      his final resolution was taken, and he has never changed from that hour.
   </p>
   
   <p>Then to clench the whole matter of the relations between these two men, I doubt
      whether there is any thing more affecting or emphatic in 
      Emersons
      
       whole
      career—a sort of last coruscation in the evening twilight of it—than his
      driving over to Frank Sanborn's in Concord, Sept 1881, to deliberately pay
      "respects" for which he had obligated himself twenty five years before.<sup><a href="#nyp.00444_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> Nor was the unusual compliment of the hospitable but
      formal dinner made the next day for Walt Whitman, by Mr and Mrs Emerson, without
      marked significance. It was a beautiful autumn Sunday. And if that afternoon, with
      its occurrences there in his own mansion, surrounded by all his family, wife, son,
      daughters, son-in-law, nearest relatives, and two or three very near
      friends—some fourteen or fifteen in all—if that does not mean how
      Emerson, by this simple yet almost solemn rite, wished, before he departed, to
      reiterate and finally seal his verdict of 1856, then there is no significance in
      human life or its emotions or<sup><a href="#nyp.00444_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00444_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd June 3/82." It is addressed: Wm Douglas O'Connor | Life Saving Service |
      Bureau | Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Camden | May | 30 | 6 PM | N.J.;
      Washington, D.C. | May | 31 | 4 AM | 1882 | Recd.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00444_n2">2. Here Whitman continued to
      assemble facts to refute Chadwick's article. On  O'Connor wrote: "I have freely used the memoranda you sent, and got
      in as much of it as I could see my way to employ, and as much as I dared"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [Boston:
      Small, Maynard, 1906], 1:52). But, fortunately, O'Connor verified some of
      Whitman's erroneous information (see note 5 below).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00444_n3">3. O'Connor's letter in the
      New York <em>Tribune</em> on May 25.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00444_n4">4. Whitman deleted: "as far
      as he did any thing."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00444_n5">5. In his reply on , O'Connor corrected Whitman's misstatements
      in this paragraph. George W. Cooke reprinted Emerson's famous letter to Whitman
      of  in <em>Ralph Waldo
         Emerson: His Life, Writings, and Philosophy</em> (Boston, 1881),
      233–234; but it was obvious that Cooke's remarks about the relations
      between the two men were speculative, not official.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00444_n6">6. It is not known exactly
      how many times Emerson visited Whitman in Brooklyn. Probably Whitman
      overstated.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00444_n7">7. See the two letters
      written at the time of Whitman's visit to Concord (the letter from Walt Whitman
      to Louisa Orr Whitman of , and
      the letter from Whitman to John Burroughs of ).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00444_n8">8. Herbert Gilchrist did not
      know that Whitman had contributed to O'Connor's article when he wrote on : "I and mother do not think very highly
      of O'Connor's blustering defence: we think that he is on the wrong tack when he
      justifies you by the classics and by what Emerson says as if that made any
      difference one way or the other" (Traubel, 1:227). See also Anne Gilchrist's
      letter to Burroughs on July 28 (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
      220–221).<a href="#r8">[back]
