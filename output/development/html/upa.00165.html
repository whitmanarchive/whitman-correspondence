      <br></br><br></br>Dearest friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>After dinner, now, seated out in an arm chair under the tree, the grass below, &amp; the
      good breeze laving me, I have just read (&amp; reread) the three letters, yours &amp; Herby's
      &amp; Mr Carpenter's—sweet, &amp; welcome &amp; bracing all of them somehow<sup><a href="#upa.00165_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yes, dear friend, I will be up by Thursday evening, in time for tea, if nothing happens—Count
      much on seeing you all, &amp; the cluster of friends—May-be while there are so many with you I had better sleep over in Camden, &amp; Herby &amp; Mr
      Burroughs<sup><a href="#upa.00165_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> take my room &amp; bed—but we will see when I come—the days I shall surely be there—
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Love to you, Herby &amp; the girls—&amp; to John Burroughs &amp; Mr Carpenter<sup xmlns=""><a href="#upa.00165_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> if they get there before me—
      <br></br>W W
      
   </p>       
   
   
   <p>Herby, to-day is cloudy &amp; threatening here though no rain yet—(I shouldn't wonder
      if Mr Stafford's prophecy ab't the week proved true)—You ought to have been here yesterday &amp; be here to-day for one thing—we have oceans of <em>delicious strawberries</em> most every meal—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>(The camp-out <em>project</em> in Aug: with J[ohn] B[urroughs] is magnificent<sup><a href="#upa.00165_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—O that I were well &amp; hardy enough, to go with you—but it is out of the question)—

   <p id="upa.00165_n2">2. Evidently Burroughs
      changed his plans. He wrote to Whitman on August 10 after a three-week trip to
      Canada and a brief visit to Boston and Concord (Charles E. Feinberg Collection;
      Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York:
      Mitchell Kennerley, 1914], 2: 318–319). He was in Camden about the middle
      of September. See the letter from Walt Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00165_n3">3. Anne Gilchrist had
      written to Burroughs early in May inviting him to meet Edward Carpenter.
      According to his next letter of May 16, Carpenter was to visit Burroughs at the
      latter's home. On June 5 Burroughs mentioned a three-day visit: "I like him
      much—a modest, sensible man and a great admirer of W. W." (Clara Barrus,
      <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New
      York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931], 140–141).<a href="#r3">[back]

      with Burroughs in September (see the letter from Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of
