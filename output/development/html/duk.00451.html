      Han<sup><a href="#nyp.00207_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> is not so well to day—but much cast down. Much disappointed, althought appreciating
      her friends, Lou<sup><a href="#n0368" id="r2">2</a></sup> and Jessie's<sup><a href="#n1055" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      visit. She thinks as I do that they should have visited our home first and administered
      to its immediate urgent necessities—taxes were due 24 dollars—which Han mentioned.
      On leaving Lou
      mentioned that Han should write to her, and she would send her all she needed.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Now Walt, we need money most taxes—then 1 ton of coal, 1 cord of wood, which Lou promise
      to pay for—coal 6—wood 4—for a stove which was set up
      
      for Han in winter, but for which there is scarcely any use, as I keep a heater all
      the winter going, pipe
      trussing upper rooms—.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      But Han is apprehensive and cast down—dread glooming her 25 years pleasant home.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Cannot something, money be raised to relieve us of this present pressure? It seems
      incredible that I could have sustained ourselves so long, with so little derived professionally.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Real estate inducements are advertised in Camden. I have written to the Agents—then
      Han would be near her family. She often desires to be near you—living near You, Walt.
      She is cast down. No money was bestowed, our good true friend.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00207_n1">1. Hannah Louisa Whitman
      Heyde (1823–1908) was Walt Whitman's younger sister, and she was one of
      the only members of the Whitman family to read and admire Whitman's writings.
      She married Charles Heyde in 1852, and the couple lived in Burlington, Vermont.
      Charles regularly disparaged his wife and her sometimes erratic behavior in his
      letters. For more information on Hannah, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0368">2. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
