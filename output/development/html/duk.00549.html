   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00549_n14">1. This letter dates to August
      26, 1868. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter August 19, 1868. Clarence
      Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver agreed with Bucke's date, and Edwin Haviland Miller
      cited Gohdes and Silver to date this letter (see <em>Faint Clews
         &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 198–199; Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–75], 2:366). The surmised date based on corresponding topics with
      Walt Whitman's  letter to Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman is reasonable but incorrect: the letter must follow George
      Washington Whitman's receipt of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's August 20,
      1868 letter (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear
         Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent
      State University Press, 1984], 128–129). The date accepted by Gohdes and
      Silver and Miller is consistent with subjects in two letters from Walt Whitman,
      one before August 19 and one after. Louisa discussed the house that George
      Washington Whitman was building at 1149 Atlantic Avenue, conceivably in response
      to a query in Walt's 
      letter to Louisa. Louisa also reacted to a "falling out" between the O'Connors
      and Ursula North Burroughs, which Walt also discussed in that letter. Finally,
      she noted that Walt was "so attached to washington," an observation to which
      Walt seems to have responded in his  letter to Louisa. Despite the seeming corroboration of these
      three topics, however, discussion of them presumably continued through multiple
      letters. The letter to dates August 26, 1868, a week later, after George has
      received a $510 draft from Jeff Whitman. Since Jeff referred to an "enclosed
      draft" in the same amount in his letter to George, Louisa's statement that
      George has received Jeff's draft must follow Jeff's letter.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00549_n1">2.  See Walt Whitman's  letter.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00549_n2">3. In his  letter, Walt Whitman
      reported a "serious falling out" between Ursula North Burroughs and the
      O'Connors (William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly"). In his  letter, he stated that the O'Connors "have
      got another house, &amp; move in about a month."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00549_n11">5. The house that George
      Washington Whitman co-owned with his partner Smith was at 1149 Atlantic Avenue.
      Walt Whitman described Smith as "a natural builder and carpenter (practically
      and in effect) architect," and he advised John Burroughs that Smith was an
      "honest, conscientious, old-fashioned man, a man of family . . . . youngish
      middle age" (see Walt's  letter
      to Burroughs). George purchased the property outright from Smith, and Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and her son Edward moved there in late September (see her  letter to Walt Whitman and his  letter to Peter Doyle).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00549_n4">7. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman had pipe for the St. Louis Water Works made at the R. D. Wood Foundry,
      which was located in Florence, New Jersey. See Jeff's  letter to George.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00549_n12">8. See Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman's August 20, 1868 letter to George Washington Whitman (Dennis Berthold
      and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of
         Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press,
      1984], 128–129). For George's financial struggles in the house-building
      business during the immediate postwar years, during which he relied on loans
      both from Walt and Jeff, see Robert Roper, <em>Now the Drum of
         War</em> (New York: Walker and Company, 2008), 352–361.<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="duk.00549_n9">9. The intended word is
      probably "reckoning," but the letter-by-letter spelling is closer to
      "rectoneng." In context, the intended word is most likely "reckoning," but given
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's phonetic spelling of unfamiliar words and casual
      inconsistency in handwriting habits, some doubt must remain.<a href="#r9">[back]
