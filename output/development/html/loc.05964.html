   <p>Dear Friend no
      doubt you will be surprised to get a 
      letter from here but as I am a relative
      of yours and daughter of Elizabeth
      Burroughs nee Wheeler, I guess you will
      pardon the liberty my mother being nearly
      through her journey and feeling as if
      she would like to hear from you [
      <span class="unclear">dearest?</span>]
      
      asked me to write you and trying to please
      her on everything while with us for a little
      longer. she would like to know about
      your sistersâ€”and brothers if alive and
      where they are. also about anything
      in the family and hoping you will
      be spared many long years [illegible]fullnes
      and it would afford us the greatest
      pleasure if you would come and make
      us a visit you when in Woodside some.
      
      
      [illegible]
      by sending love of the united family
      My Brother John Burroughs called to see
      you some time ago in in Camden

   <p id="loc.05964_n1">1. Ted Genoways dated this
      letter 1879 (see Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed.
      Ted Genoways [Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2004], 7:145). It seems more
      likely based on the content, however, that this letter came before the letter
      from Sarah [Bownes?] to Whitman of .<a href="#r1">[back]
