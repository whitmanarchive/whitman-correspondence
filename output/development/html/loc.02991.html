      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt W.:—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>How is the healthy invalid to-day? I rcd mag. of poetry (&amp; re-mailed) &amp; the Chicago
      paper. Good <u>"ads"</u> for you they ought to be. How hard it is
      to live down a pre-conceived wrong impression! These very numerous articles <u>ought</u> to sell any man's books rapidly.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just spent an hour or so writing to publishers Gardner<sup><a href="#n4318" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; Wilson.<sup><a href="#loc.03316_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Have
      expressed the MS. to
      <u>Gardner</u>, after waiting six weeks in vain on Wilson. I
      dislike him &amp; his ways much. But I tell him it is still not too late if he will say
      the word. He acts like an imbecile—to me.
   </p>

   <p>New Electric lamps in Belmont. Beautiful! I have just been out to see the
      brilliant star-show; noticed the big cherry tree in the lane splashed all over
      one side with white, &amp; found it was one of the Electric lamps a full quarter of
      a mile away (on a rise of ground) that caused it. These new lights poetize the
      night wonderfully don't they?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4318">1. Alexander Gardner (1821–1882)
      of Paisley, Scotland, was a publisher who reissued a number of books by and
      about Whitman; he ultimately published William Sloane Kennedy's <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> in 1896 after a long and
      contentious battle with Kennedy over editing the book. Gardner published and
      co-edited the <em>Scottish Review</em> from 1882 to 1886.<a href="#r1">[back]
