   <p>Your kind letter (Eva's) came this afternoon &amp; it gave me real comfort both to
      hear from you &amp; have such loving remembrance &amp; friendly
      invitation—Harry, dear boy, I hardly think I shall be able to come down &amp;
      be with you this Thanksgiving<sup><a href="#loc.04000_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—but I will come one
      of these times—Since I have got into this shanty, although I go out every day,
      I don't go any distance—havn't been away this past summer, only one short trip
      to Cape May<sup><a href="#loc.04000_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—My lameness increases on me—it
      probably won't be long before I shall be unable to get around at all——General
      health otherwise about the same as usual—Eva, my dear friend it would be a
      true comfort for me if it was so I could come in every few days, and you and Harry
      and I 
       
      could be together—I am sure it would be good for me——Nothing very new in my affairs—not
      much sale for my books at present, or for
      the last fifteen months—Harry your Mother call'd here last Monday, but I was
      not in, was over to Germantown—I was sorry to be away—I am writing this
      up in my room—am alone most of the time—write a little most every
      day—sell a piece once in a while—Maintain good spirits and a first-rate
      appetite—My dear friends, indeed I appreciate your loving wishes &amp;
      feelings, &amp; send you mine the same, for both of you—

      right &amp; heal in time

   <p><em>Correspondents:</em><br>Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<br><br>Eva Westcott married Harry Stafford in 1884.<br></p>
