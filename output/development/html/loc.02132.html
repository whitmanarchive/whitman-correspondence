      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I talked last night to my Waltham class (of forty ladies) about your work and read
      to
      them. I wish you could have seen how deeply attentive they were and how moved by 
      "Out of the Cradle" "To Think of Time" "Sparkles from the Wheel" and others. Many
      of
      them will now read your works carefully and understandingly. I told them to come at
      you through "Specimen Days."<sup><a href="#n4121" id="r2">2</a></sup> I always advise my pupils so. After reading your prose they are
      better prepared to sympathize with your poetic views. I am much pleased with
      "November Boughs"<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r3">3</a></sup> and expect to do quite a good review soon. Mr. Clement<sup><a href="#loc.02132_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> of The <u>Transcript</u> is a personal friend and is quite kindly
      disposed toward your work. Indeed, all the leading men on The <u>Transcript</u> are. Baxter<sup><a href="#n6000" id="r5">5</a></sup> is away. Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r6">6</a></sup> I have not seen. Chamberlain<sup><a href="#n3155" id="r7">7</a></sup>  is in the library as usual. I
      think I told you of the good letter I had from Burroughs.<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r8">8</a></sup> I hope Mr.
      Howells<sup><a href="#n0316" id="r9">9</a></sup> will succeed in doing something for "November Boughs" in the December number
      it is such a great number usually.
   </p>
   
   <p>It rejoices me to think you are gaining. I hope the winter will not be too severe
      for
      you.  Though I believe you stand the cold better than the heat. I hope to hear a word
      from you occasionally.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Hamlin Garland
      (1860–1940) was an American novelist and autobiographer, known especially
      for his works about the hardships of farm life in the American Midwest. For his
      relationship to Whitman, see Thomas K. Dean, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_190.html">Garland, Hamlin</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02132_n2">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle St. Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked: Jamaica
      Plain Sta'n | Nov | 9 | 2PM |Mass.; Camden, N. J. | Nov | 10 | 10AM | 1888 |
      Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4121">2. The first issue of Whitman's <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em> was published by the
      Philadelphia firm of Rees Welsh and Company in 1882. The second issue was
      published by David McKay. Many of the autobiographical notes, sketches, and
      essays that focus on the poet's life during and beyond the Civil War had been
      previously published in periodicals or in <em>Memoranda During the
         War</em> (1875–1876). For more information on <em>Specimen Days</em>, see George Hutchinson and David Drews "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_54.html"><em>Specimen Days</em> [1882]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">3. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02132_n3">4. Edward Henry Clement
      (1843–1920) of Chelsea, Massachusetts, began his career as a journalist
      with the <em>Savannah Daily News</em> in the mid-1860s. He later
      became the editor of the <em>Boston Transcript</em>, a position
      that he held for twenty-five years.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6000">5. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">6. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3155">7. Mellen Chamberlain
      (1821–1900) was the librarian of the Boston Public Library as well as a
      lawyer and historian.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">8. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0316">9. William Dean Howells (1837–1920) was the
      novelist and "Dean of American Letters" who wrote <em>The Rise of
         Silas Lapham</em> (1885) among other works. He described his first meeting
      with Walt Whitman at Pfaff's in <em>Literary Friends and
         Acquaintances</em> (New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1900), 73–76.<a href="#r9">[back]
