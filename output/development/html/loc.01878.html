      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The receipt of your letter of 3 Decr. this morning<sup><a href="#loc.01878_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
      wd.
      
       have made me feel miserable were it not that before then the matter had
      already been set right, &amp; my letter notifying that fact very nearly (no doubt)
      in your hands by this time. My first letter to you was written too much from the
      impulse of the moment; &amp;, finding soon after from  the publisher's statement that the
      original plan of the selection <u>could</u> not be altered, I
      felt that it was also much better it <u>should</u> not be
      altered. I congratulate myself therefore on being quite at one with you concerning
      that point. Not one syllable of any one of your poems, as presented in my selection,
      will be altered or omitted: that is the first intention &amp; the final result.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pray believe me however that, while I understand the latitude your first letter 
      honoured
      
       me with in its wildest sense, I still meant to take all proper precautions
      before acting upon it. I wrote  at once to Mr. Conway<sup><a href="#n0170" id="r2">2</a></sup> enquiring whether he
      put the same interpretation upon it; &amp; his letter in reply (18 Nov., now before
      me) replies—"I agree with you that Whitman's letter gives you all the liberty you
      
      cd.
      
       desire." I am now perfectly satisfied that it 
      wd.
      
       have been most undesirable for you to give or for me (even if given) to
      act upon such liberty.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To be 
      honoured
      
       by your friendship is as great a satisfaction &amp; distinction as my life
      has presented or ever can present. I respond to it with all warmth &amp; reverence,
      &amp;; the Atlantic seemed  a very small space between us while I read &amp; re-read your
      letter.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I read your paper on Democracy (received a few days ago) with great pleasure &amp;
      interest. I have always felt—&amp; did so markedly while our own recent Reform
      discussions were going on—one main truth involved in your paper: That, after one has
      said that such &amp; such people or classes are not exactly fitted to make the best
      use of political enfranchisement, one has said only a small part of the truth, the
      further point remaining that to induct these people or classes into the combined  national life, &amp;
      to constitute that life out of them along with all other classes, is an enormous
      gain. The consequence is that, with the intensest respect &amp; admiration for
      Carlyle,<sup><a href="#n0139" id="r3">3</a></sup> I find constantly that to acquiesce in the express
      views he takes of late years of particular questions 
      wd
      
       be simply to abnegate my own identity.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The selection goes on smoothly 
      tho
      
       not fast—the proofs now approaching their close. I suppose the volume will
      not fall much if at all short of 400 pp.—You may possibly have seen the
      advertisement of it repeated several times in publications here, as enclosed  (slip cut from the
      Athenaeum). The "Portrait" is a re-engraving (head &amp; shoulders only, I believe)
      of the one in the first Leaves of Grass, 
      wh.
      
       was a capital piece of art work. I have not yet seen the reproduction, but
      trust to find it adequately done.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
