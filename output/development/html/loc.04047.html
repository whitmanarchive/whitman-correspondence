      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have had a sick week—two days pretty bad—last Sunday night had a
      strange chill, rattled me for two hours lively—one or two since but
      milder—the doctor thinks my system has got all chilled through—havnt
       been out for a week till this evening, went to the post office—am
      feeling better to-day, but weak—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How are you all? Was glad to have a call from Debbie &amp; your neice Lizzie—So
      Lizzie Hider and Wes are to be married soon<sup><a href="#loc.04047_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—well
      if it is to come off at all the sooner the better &amp; I hope it will turn out a
      happy marriage,—should say there was the best reason to expect it to, for both
      have estimable qualities &amp; I 
      dont
      
       see how a woman can help loving the good man she lives with as a
      wife—Best love to Harry, I got his good letter &amp; will answer it
      soon—love to George &amp; all
   </p>
