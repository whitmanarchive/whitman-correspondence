   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Asa K. Butts was a New York
      bookseller. Whitman was having difficulties around this time—real or
      imaginary, as his mother might have said—with booksellers. Commenting on
      one of the letters of Butts, Whitman observed to Horace Traubel in 1889: "What a
      sweat I used to be in all the time . . . over getting my damned books published!
      When I look back at it I wonder I didn't somewhere or other on the road chuck
      the whole business into oblivion" (<em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.79.html">Friday, January 18, 1889</a>). Butts went bankrupt in 1874.
