      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Enclosed I send you a piece printed here to give a <em>true</em> statement of the situation—&amp; which I should be 
      well satisfied to have printed in Britain. I ought to have written you before. I have
      read your "Shakspere"<sup><a href="#med.00441_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; ought to have thanked you for it. I find it full of vitality &amp; suggestiveness,
      on themes that 
      might be supposed exhausted years ago—but are not at all exhausted.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I write I am feeling pretty comfortable—much the same as for last two years—no
      worse.
      John Burroughs was here with me last week. He is well. …<sup><a href="#med.00441_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>M D Conway has called upon us. He is a good &amp; intellectual man, but I don't think
      I either got hold of him, 
      nor he of me, <em>at all</em>. My friend, I must still put off for another letter some things I have had in my
      mind 
      for months to say to you. Your letters past—what John Burroughs told me—(and your
      Shakspere book)—have <em>grafted</em> you more on my good will &amp; memory than you perhaps know. I write in haste.
      
   </p>

      This letter must have been written about the same time as the one to William
      Michael Rossetti (dated ), for
      the following reasons: Whitman referred to the article in the <em>West Jersey Press</em>, to Burroughs' visit in the middle
      of January, and to Conway's recent interview. Dowden apparently replied to
      this letter on . However,
      Dowden's letter on , also
      noted receipt of a communication referring to his book on Shakespeare.<br><br>

   <p id="med.00441_n2">2. The presentation copy of
      Dowden's <em>
         Shakspere
         
         : A Critical Study of His Mind and Art</em> (London: Henry S. King,
      1875), now in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., is marked on every page
      for the first eighty pages but only sporadically after that, although there are
      underlined passages throughout the entire volume. The underscoring in various
      kinds of pencils and comments dated in the 1880s indicate that Whitman examined
      Dowden's study several times. Whitman had praised the book's opening chapters in
      his  letter to John Burroughs.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="med.00441_n3">3.  Probably at this point
      Whitman mentioned the publication of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and
      <em>Two Rivulets</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
