       this be my apology for speaking to you with my heart laid bare—I
      tried very hard to secure a copy of your "Leaves", and at last in New York did so,
      I
      took the book up and ran my eyes over detached lines uninterestedly because carelessly:
      at last
      I came to a poem ("24"—page 242 Thayer &amp; Eldridge edition) that brought me
      to a stand-still and as I read and reread the lines I felt—I, the
      conventional young man, or
      
      
      boy, if you
      will—but it <u>was</u> a "man flushed and full [
      <span class="unclear">blooded?</span>]
       who stood naked, body and soul,
      before me. I went back to the beginning, I have read and reread carefully, I do
      not understand you all in all fully, but I recognize the manliness of you, the power
      you possess, the strength of mind and limb—and, [
      <span class="unclear">meter?</span>]
       of conventional ideas in the lines and
      feet of conventional poetry as I am. I feel how weak and
      pitiful physically and mentally I must look to the better, the
      
      
      stronger part of
      me—my dear sir, I cannot analyze my feelings, had any one told me that my
      blood would
      leap, my soul cry out at the poems of a man, as blood and soul and heart spring at
      some
      glorious aspect of nature, I should have laughed at him—But I feel while
      reading you (not your book, but you) as though I were let loose in some grand rugged
      place where I
      had never thought to be, and all around teeming with pre Adamite strangeness 
      and
      majesty—This is just you and myself. I cannot help writing you. I do not know
      if you will read anything I say, whether my name is a familiar or unfamiliar
      one to you,—but at least I am and must be hereafter one who "loves you
      secretly" in his heart, and openly to the world—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>At least it must be something to you to have a man say that you have done him good,
      physically and spiritually
      
      
      good. It cannot
      be so much a matter of indifference to you that in all gratitude I offer my tender
      thanks and changed belief and admiration. I have taken "from your lips" the kiss,
      and with all my heart and soul return it to you. Believe that I shall study you more
      and more, and if ever the day comes that I may give you the hearty and true hand
      grasp, and look in your eyes and in your face, even though my own tongue is silent
      
      I think you will
      understand my soul and that I am faithfully your friend

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3027">1. According to an 1890 description of
      James Berry Bensel (1855–1886), a "native of New York city, he was a
      student in Lynn, Mass., a clerk in Boston, and, following his literary bent, an
      author and public reader. His life is the pathetic and too familiar story of
      suffering and unfulfilled promise" (Charles H. Crandall, <em>Representative Sonnets by American Poets</em>, [Boston and New York:
      Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1890], 323). Bensel published a volume of poems
      titled <em>In the King's Garden: And Other Poems</em> (Boston: D.
      Lothrop and Company, 1885).<a href="#r1">[back]
