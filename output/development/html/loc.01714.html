      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir, 
      
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>Your letter of Feb. 8, '73, remitting my acc't, and sales up to 1st of June, '72, 
      (with check of $12:60) was duly acknowledged at time. If convenient, could you advise
      me, 
      or get Messrs. Lee, Shephard, &amp; Dillingham<sup><a href="#loc.01714_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      to advise me, of sales by them since that time, 
      and to remit me the amount? Also how many books are now on hand.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Also please return me, if convenient, the printed slip I forwarded you of my last
      acc't. with you, marked in blue pencil "return this."
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I would also like to inquire of Messrs. Lee, Shephard &amp; Dillingham whether 
      they would not take my books, (the new editions) &amp; job them. Redfield sent me word
      
      that Mr. Dillingham declined, thinking there was no inducement, but I am in hopes
      he will still take them.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I am in a bad way at present from paralysis—and am sick, &amp; unable 
      to get to New York, or any where—but expect soon to be better.<sup><a href="#loc.01714_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>There is beginning to be a steady, though moderate demand for my books, 
      &amp; if there were a good &amp; permanent place of publication, I should advertise sufficiently.
      
   </p>
