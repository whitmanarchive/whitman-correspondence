      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been through "Specimen Days and Collect<sup><a href="#n4121" id="r1">1</a></sup>" pretty thoroughly, it is well printed
      and I find remarkably few corrections of any kind required—I enclose a list of
      what I have found.
   </p>
   
   <p>This makes about six times that I have read "Democratic Vistas<sup><a href="#n4122" id="r2">2</a></sup> it is a wonderful
      piece of writing, as fine in some respects as any thing in L. of G. but of course
      has not the life, fire, inspiration (or whatever you may call it) of such poems as
      "Song of Myself" "A Song of the Open Road" and a good many others, however I now
      take back entirely what I once said to you about "Democratic Vistas" to the effect
      that some other man might have written it. At the present moment I do not believe
      any other man who ever lived might or could
   </p>
   
   
   <p>have written it any more than any other man could have written "Calamus"—I go
      to Toronto tomorrow on some government business, shall be gone a few days, I want
      to
      hear from you, how you keep, whan you are coming here &amp;c &amp;c.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      I am with much love
      <br></br>Affectionately yours
      <br></br>R M Bucke

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4121">1. The first issue of Whitman's <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em> was published by the
      Philadelphia firm of Rees Welsh and Company in 1882. The second issue was
      published by David McKay. Many of the autobiographical notes, sketches, and
      essays that focus on the poet's life during and beyond the Civil War had been
      previously published in periodicals or in <em>Memoranda During the
         War</em> (1875–1876). For more information on <em>Specimen Days</em>, see George Hutchinson and David Drews "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_54.html"><em>Specimen Days</em> [1882]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed.

      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4122">2. Whitman's <em>Democratic Vistas</em> was first published in 1871 in New York by J.S.
      Redfield. The volume was an eighty-four-page pamphlet that consisted of three
      essays titled "Democracy," "Personalism," and "Orbic Literature," all of which
      Whitman intended to publish in the <em>Galaxy</em> magazine. Only
      "Democracy" and "Personalism" appeared in the magazine. For more information on
      <em>Democratic Vistas</em>, see Arthur Wrobel, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_4.html"><em>Democratic Vistas</em> [1871]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
