      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you think I have 
      forgoten
      
       you and well you might think so for I have been very negligent in writing
      to you but you will please forgive me as when I returned from the Army I felt that
      I
      was 3 years behind and must soon do something 
      tword
      
       fixing for old age. I have been in the West for 4 years past and retuned
      to York State a few weeks ago think of staying here for a time to take care of my
      mother her health is quite poor. As I spoke of 
      forgeting
      
       you I will say I have not forgot you nor your friendly kindness 
      twords
      
       me in 
      Army
      
       Square Hospital I have 
      thaught
      
       of you so
      many times and wondered where you was and how you was 
      geting
      
       along I suppose you are in Washington so I will run the chances of taking
      this chat with you 
      their
      
      . Now Father Whitman I wish to ask you a few questions concerning the
      soldier land Bounty Bill how much can a soldier that served 3
      years take up and how long has he got to live on it before he can get a 
      fitle
      
       also I wish to ask your 
      advise
      
       where would be the best locality to take up said land I know you are
      better posted about these things than I am and shall expect what you have to say for
      the best. How are the times in the City now I 
      dont
      
       expect it is as 
      livly
      
       as during the war. I should like to see you very much why 
      cant
      
       you come out here and spend a little time if you are not 
      buisy
      
       come out and spend the summer I will do all I can to make it pleasant for
      you friend Wood lives near here he is well.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I have lost track of nearly all my old chums if I was able to 
      travil
      
       I would like to see some of them for they were dear good boys. One thing
      more I would like to ask you could you get me a variety of flower seeds if so I will
      send you the money to pay for them and your trouble
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I will have to draw my letter to a close for fear of wearing your 
      patients
      
       to read it Please 
      except
      
       my love and best 
      wishe
      
       and please write soon and Oblige your
   </p>
