      <br></br><br></br>Dear Ruthey
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your letter and was glad to hear from you by your own writing. You must
      be
      having good times over there at Glendale. Do you all like it there as well as the
      old farm? Well Ruth it is now over six months since I have seen any of you except
      Harry.<sup><a href="#loc.04022_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> The last three I have been away in New
      York—return'd only a few days ago—I am well and fat, &amp; have been so,
      &amp; my visit &amp; lecture &amp; jaunts on the water &amp; seashore &amp;c. all
      did me good.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Tell your mother that the baby born over two years ago when Mrs Johnston died there
      in N Y is still living &amp; though not rugged is a nice sweet little child—He
      is named Harry<sup><a href="#loc.04022_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To-day a friend from Philadelphia has made me a half-hour call, with his four nice
      girls, one of them about your age, two a little older, &amp; one younger. He has
      four boys and four girls. First he takes the four boys out, &amp; then the four
      girls—I enjoyed their call—They were going off on a little
      excursion—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My brother &amp; sister are well as usual—My nieces are now here<sup><a href="#loc.04022_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—have left school—they are grown, tall hearty
      girls—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Tell Mont<sup><a href="#loc.04022_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I want to see him—I often wished he was
      with me to see the sights, when I was in New York—It is very hot here
      to-day—I want to come down soon, probably next week, &amp; see you all &amp;
      see the new place—I will send word a day or two before, so Mont or you can
      come to the station for me. Love to you &amp; all, Ruthy dear. I shall come
      soon.<sup><a href="#loc.04022_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>
