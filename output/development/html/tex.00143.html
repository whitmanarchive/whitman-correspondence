   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00143_n2">1. Adrian Bartlett was a friend
      of Joseph Harris and Lewis Brown; all three met Whitman while they were being
      treated at Armory Square Hospital. On , Brown reported that he had not seen Bartlett and Harris since
      they returned from a spree to Baltimore on July 4, 1864. According to Brown's
      letter of , the three young men
      were living in a Washington boardinghouse; Harris was not in good health, and
      Bartlett worked in the Treasury Department.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00143_n3">2. John Strain, recorded in
      Whitman's notebook as "Co A 1st Indiana Cav" (Edward F. Grier, ed., <em>Notes and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–84], 2:670). Bush refers to Strain as his
      hospital "companion." (See the letter from Alonzo S. Bush to Walt Whitman from
      .)<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00143_n4">3. Ana Lowell ("Miss Lowell"),
      worked as a nurse in Armory Square Hospital during the Civil War.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00143_n5">4. Lewis K. Brown
      (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
      August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
      transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Walt Whitman met him, probably in
      February, 1863. In a diary in the Feinberg Collection, Whitman described Brown
      on February 19 as 'a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come and
      sit by him.' Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on January 5,
      1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary (Thomas Biggs
      Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #103).
      Brown was mustered out in August, 1864, and was employed in the Provost
      General's office in September. The following September he became a clerk in the
      Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief of the Paymaster's Division in
      1880, a post which he held until his retirement in 1915. (This material is drawn
      from a memorandum prepared by Brown's family, now in the Library of Congress.)"
