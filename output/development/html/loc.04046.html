   <p>Thanks for your kind note just 
      rec'd—I think I had better send you the Two Volumes without further
      ceremony, which I do, same mail with this, same address. All the little pieces
      Stedman speaks of as <em>pasted</em>
      (in a very small prior edition) <em>are in this</em> being afterwards
      put in the plates<sup><a href="#loc.04046_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Warmest thanks for your friendly
      words &amp; invitation—I am a little more unwell even than usual these days
      &amp; 
      dont
      
       get out of the house—but with Spring &amp; good weather shall no
      doubt be all right again—I truly hope, my friend, we shall meet—I shall
      be on the look out for you—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04046_n1">1. See the letter from
      Whitman to Ellen Louise Chandler Moulton of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04046_n2">2. In the first printing of
      the 1876 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> some poems were
      pasted in: these intercalations are visually distinctive both because they are
      pasted on the page and because Whitman used a different typeface for the titles.
      In the next issue, however, the poems became fully integrated into the printing
      of the volume, and he used a typeface matching that of the rest of the
      book.<a href="#r2">[back]
