      Walt Whitman Washington D.C.
      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Mr Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have many messages for you from some friends in Europe which I promised and so much
      desired to deliver face to face; and day after day and week after week I promised
      myself and hoped to come to you, but now I shall not see you till I return; for I
      am tired of towns and tomorrow set my face to the West. I am weary and want rest,
      and I cannot rest in cities. My address for a time will be San Francisco and since
      I cannot see you I should be proud of a letter from you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am tired of books too and take but one with me; one Rossetti gave me, a "Walt Whitman"—Grand
      old man! The grandest, and truest American I know, accept the love of your son.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Joaquin Miller was the pen name of Cincinnatus Heine
      Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of the Rockies" and
      "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <em>Westminster Review</em>
      described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness which marked Walt Whitman's
      poetry." In an entry in his journal dated August 1, 1871, John Burroughs
      recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's poetry; see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin Co., 1931), 60. Whitman met Miller for the first time later in 1872; he
      wrote of a visit with Miller in a 
      letter to Charles W. Eldridge.
