      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I feel so drawn to send you a Christmas greeting. I hear from Percy that you are
      in better health than you were during the summer. I hope you may constantly
      improve. I read a medical article once, which said: "If a person has had poor
      health through middle life and has struggled on so as to reach his sixty-second
      year, the probability is that he will live through the next twenty years in very
      comfortable condition." I trust this may prove a truth in your life. I don't
      know if I think it a fine wish, to hope for length of days for those we love or
      not, but somehow it seems as though the later days of an earnest soul are the
      ripest fruit of all the seasonsâ€”well-conditioned. So I look upon the life
      of a person in healthy mind, from the time we call middle age to the years of
      eighty or more, as the most helpful to humanity and oftenest the most serene
      and richest to the person himself. So let me wish you a good long life, full of
      comfort, full of gifts to the world. Did you receive an invitation to the
      wedding of my daughter, Blanche, on the 14th of June last? I said to her:
      "Choose who you like to come;" and she said: "Oh, I would be so glad to have
      Walt Whitman! He seems so much like one of our family." I send you her picture,
      that you may think of the child who feels like a sister to you. This was our
      baby, and she has left her home for one in Chicago. We were never before
      separated. It is a trial. So often I think of the days of my youth, amid the
      calm content of Quaker society, so beautiful. The home where often four
      generations in one family lived, a bit of the farm given to a child at his
      coming of age, and the marriage of youths scarcely separating families. Until I
      came to Michigan, thirty years ago, all my surroundings were among Friends,
      twelve years at Roslyn and Friends meeting at Wesbury. Did you ever attend a
      silent meeting? If not, do go some day to Philadelphia and feel its solemnity.
      The last I was at was at Race Street. The early hour was silent; then George
      Truman said a few words that seemed to fall like seed in the prepared soil. A
      cat came into the meeting and took its place beside the speaker. It all seemed
      right. Everything seemed so harmonious, that the quiet movements of any domestic
      animal would have created no surprise. Tears came into my children's eyes. After
      meeting I asked them why? They could not tell, only it was "so sweet, so
      solemn." I will tell you a story about Percy's mother, when she was a little
      child, seven years old. A baby had been born while she was at school. It was
      dead. I took it into a quiet room, made it look pretty, and put a few flowers
      about it. It looked not much different from a doll. I had often wondered if a
      child had naturally a fear of death, of being alone with the dead. When Minnie
      came home, I said: "Would you like to look at the pretty baby?" She touched the
      hand and face and kissed the face, and wanted to hold it in her arms. I laid it
      in her lap, and said: "Be careful." There was an instinct that forbade her to
      hold it up, and she did not want to give it up. I said: "Would you like to stay
      and keep it a while?" "Yes." Then I left her alone and stood outside, thinking
      she might lift it. In a few minutes she called, and asked me "to take it." I
      asked, "Why?" "Oh, it was so still, it made her feel so strange! She did not
      want to be alone, if mamma would stay." Then I wondered if it was the silence, so
      powerful is it, in its messages. So I feel the silences in the meetings of
      Friends. I can't tell why, there is a solemnity that finds its way through the
      soul.

   <p>I am my friend with kindest regards,</p>
