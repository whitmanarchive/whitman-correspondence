   <p>Two or three little matters I will write to you about.<sup><a href="#loc.05824_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      How is the publication of the German version getting on? My guess would be that when
      fairly afloat it might have quite as much sale here in the United States as in
      Germany—perhaps more. Would of course require a little while to get bruited
      about—but then I think quite probable a steady demand would set in. Two or
      three central book jobbing houses should be fixed upon, one in New York, one in
      Chicago, &amp; one in San Francisco—

   <p>With an eye to this I would like early copies sent to
      <br><br><span>Wm Sloane Kennedy, Belmont, Mass:</span><br>
      <span>J L &amp; J B Gilder, Critic office, 18 Astor Place New York City</span><br>
      <span>Prof. Edward Dowden, Temple Road Winstead Rathmine's, Dublin Ireland</span><br>
      <span>Talcott Williams, Daily Press cor 7th &amp; Chestnut Sts Phila</span><br>
      <span>Editors, Daily Republican newspaper Springfield Mass</span><br>
      <span>Dr Karl Knortz cor Morris av and 155th st New York</span><br>
      <span>R W Gilder Century Magazine, Union Sq N Y</span><br>
      <br>
      All the above would quite certainly announce and review the German trans.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more

      On , Rolleston informed Whitman of
      the progress of his translation. Despite Rolleston's willingness to subsidize
      the German edition, he was not able to publish it (see the letter from Whitman
      to Rolleston of ).<a href="#r1">[back]
