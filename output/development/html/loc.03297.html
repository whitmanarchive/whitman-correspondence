      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I got yours of the 29th ultimo, with the slip from The <u>Critic</u>.<sup><a href="#loc.03297_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> It is a magnificent compliment, and
      was inexpressibly comforting. John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r2">2</a></sup> told me when he
      was here, and has since written to the same effect, that what I say on the question
      does not touch him at all, and although one  does not mind such things at
      first, yet gradually, and especially when they are only part of one concurrent
      voice, they more than half persuade one that he is a visionary jackass, and have a
      deeply disheartening effect—all the more, I think, when one's convictions on
      the matter are clear and deep. There is nothing more evident to me than what
      Machiavel in <u>The Prince</u> did for tyranny—i.e. sow
      death for it by 
      simply showing it up without bias and with perfect candor—Bacon (i.e.
      Shakespeare) did for feudality. It is the old story of the basilisk—if you see
      him first, he dies. In the plays—the historical plays especially—Bacon
      sees the basilisk in all his nature and proportions. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I regret I am not free of office life, for I am sure I could make Bacon's part in
      all this matter so evident that Time would remember it.  Criticism on Shakespeare has not
      yet begun, nor can it ever begin, until the coincidence with the Baconian
      movement—the divine conspiracy of the <u>Novum Organum</u>
      against false civilization—is recognized. So far comment on Shakespeare has
      been merely esthetic. But the relation of that drama to that age—that
      marvellous "time-bettering age"—<u>that</u> is the main question. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I am extremely gratified  at the reinforcement your article brings. In this connection,
      please read <u>Coriolanus</u>. The impersonation of the feudal military spirit in the hero
      is perfect, and there are scenes—notably that of the conference between the
      tribunes when they plan "to darken him forever"—which are revelations. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I have an article before the <u>Manhattan</u> which  I now hope more
      than ever they will publish, for it has some things about Bacon I would like you to
      read. 
   </p>
   
   <p> There is a noble picture of him, from the painting by Vandyck, in the October <u>Harper</u>. Look at it, and ask yourself whether that face
      belongs to one who was "the meanest of mankind"! Nothing refutes a slander like a
      good portrait. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I have been over today to the Surgeon General's Office to see about data for you.
      I
      know Dr. Huntington, the Acting Surgeon General, very well. I am afraid that the
      quest will be fruitless. The only matter they have is the "Medical and Surgical
      History of the War", now in process of publication. What you want—i.e.
      hospital matter—will be in the third volume, and this is now being made up,
      and will not be ready,  unfortunately, for a year. I am sorry. However, I will go down
      tomorrow, to the Medical Museum, and, (as Dr. Huntington suggested to me] talk with
      Dr.
      Wild, the librarian, and see if he can give me anything. I fear it is
      unlikely—the publications being inchoate. You shall hear duly. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I am crushed with work at present. The weather is simply infernal. I wish you were
      better, and hope the coming coolness of October will revive you. More anon.<sup><a href="#loc.03297_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03297_n1">1. See Whitman's letter to
      O'Connor of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">2. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03297_n2">3. Discussing this letter with
      his disciple Horace Traubel in May 1888, Whitman comments: "William is a master:
      his art is wonderful to me. He never writes a letter—even a business
      letter—without giving it that final touch of art which takes it out of the
      mass of epistolary writing. William is a constant marvel to me—like the
      sun each morning, like the stars every night: he never grows stale" (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.52.html">Saturday, May 19, 1888</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.03297_n3">4. Lafcadio Hearn
      (1850–1904) was an author and journalist, who lived in a number of
      countries, including the U.S. and, late in his life, Japan. He was well known
      for his Japanese folk tales and ghost stories. O'Connor had been in contact with
      the author, who was living in the United States at the time. Their
      correspondence is housed at Berg Collection at New York's Public Library
      (William Douglas O'Connor collection of papers). O'Connor might be referencing
      Hearn's book titled <em>Magic Melodies</em> that is reprinted in
      Vol. 13 of <em>The Writings of Lafcadio Hearn</em> (Boston and New
      York: Houghton Mifflin, 1922).<a href="#r4">[back]
