      <br></br><br></br>Dear John Burroughs
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours rec'd last week—Nothing new with me—I still keep well—The lecture<sup><a href="#uva.00391_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> is a <u>fixed fact</u> (to come)—but I shall wait till I get good &amp; ready—I suppose as I am writing this
      you &amp; 'Sula are now home—I 'most envy you—Very cold here to day, but bright—&amp; I am
      just going out for a couple of hours
   </p>
   
   
   <p><u>25th Christmas afternoon</u>—Went out—also yesterday—but not long or far, as we are having a sharp spell of cold
      &amp; gusty winds here these days—Rec'd a letter from Herbert Gilchrist this morning—they are at 315 West 19 Street, N. Y.
      
      
      now, in their own apartments, &amp; I believe expect to be for the winter—Call on them,
      &amp; 'Sula call too, when down—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Write me more fully about your proposed book of next spring—(it is in the gestation
      of a book—the melting of the fluid metal, before the casting—that it receives that
      something to make its idiosyncrasy, identity—its "excuse for being" if it is to have
      any—)<sup><a href="#uva.00391_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p> 
   
   
   <p>I have written to Jenny Gilder &amp; sent her a small budget of printed slips &amp;c. (I would
      like best to be <u>told about</u> in strings of continuous anecdotes, incidents, <u>mots</u>, thumbnail personal sketches, characteristic &amp; true—such for instance as are in the
      2d edition of your old Wash'n <u>Notes</u>)<sup><a href="#uva.00391_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of 17th Dec. rec'd—Tennyson's &amp; the criticism safely rec'd <u>back</u>—I suppose you rec'd the hat photo. you spoke of—(I sent it to you Oct 1st)—I mail'd you also a pair of
      buck gloves—&amp; Smith a pair too—four days since<sup><a href="#uva.00391_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I shall send this to Delaware County, as you say you are going home for a few days—Write
      me if you get it all right
   </p>
