   <p>I have looked over the 2d piece "Jay Charleton's"—&amp; it is the silliest
      compound of nonsense, lies &amp; rot I have ever seen—Not a line but has an
      absurd lie—The paper of Conway is not much better<sup><a href="#duk.00819_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>If you want to keep your book from <em>foulness</em> &amp; ridiculous
      misstatements you had better leave both pieces out.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00819_n1">1. William Shepherd Walsh's
      <em>Pen Pictures of Modern Authors</em> (1882), 161–177,
      included a reprint of Conway's article in <em>The Fortnightly
         Review</em> in 1866 (see the letter from Walt to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      of ) and "a flashy bit of
      Bohemian literature by 'Jay Charlton,'" the pen name of J. C. Goldsmith (see
      William Sloane Kennedy, <em>The Fight of a Book for the
         World</em>, 55); this piece offered an impression of Whitman among the New York
      Bohemians at Pfaff's beer cellar and characterized the poet's "yawps" as
      "wretched failures" because "his Pegasus is a mad bull, dashing furiously into
      swamps, ditches, and dung-hills, and then frightening literature by shaking his
      muddy horns at it." Kennedy on  agreed to
      omit both articles.<a href="#r1">[back]
