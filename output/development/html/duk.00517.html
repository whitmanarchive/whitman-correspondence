   <p>we have lived
      to see something that never was
      i
      suppose known before in america 
      the impeachment) i think it rather
      sad but notwithstanding exactly as
      it should be i suppose the excitement
      at washington  is far greater
      than here the copperheads<sup><a href="#duk.00517_n13" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      here is all
      for fight that a war will be
      
      the result some great politician
      down town wanted to bet
      yesterday that the impeachment
      would not take place so our
      georgey<sup><a href="#duk.00425_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      took him up told
      him he would bet him that
      andrew Johnso  would be impeached
      in ten hours from that time<sup><a href="#duk.00517_n9" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      the gentleman backed down
      after putting his hand in his
      pocket to take out his money
      george came home on sunday 
      morning very unexpected as
      i dident  look for him till next
      saturday  he came something about
      the iron of the pipes he rejected
      as unfit) i got your letter walter
      yesterday monday  with 5 dollars
      i was glad to have it walt but
      i doo  think sometimes you send
      me more than you can afford
      and more than i ought to expect
      but mamma appreciates it if she
      dont  make many [illegible] walt you
      wrote about your peice  in an
      english magazine<sup><a href="#duk.00517_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      that you got
      50 d in gold its first rate to handle
      gold in these days<sup><a href="#duk.00517_n11" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      but i want
      
      
      
      to know what peice  it was i
      thought of every one and could
      not make out what peice  it was
      when you write again i wish you
      would tell me all about it
      but the gold is quite a new thing
      to be paid in these days) i think we
      will get the galaxy and see Ocono[

      peice<sup><a href="#duk.00517_n17" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      if its as stupid as his others
      i dont  think it will be worth
      25 cts   i dont  see into his writing
      such peices  as he writes i should
      think him<sup><a href="#duk.00470_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> capable of writing
      something more substancial 
      a man that can converse as he can

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00517_n10">1. This letter dates to
      February 25, 1868. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter February 25, 1868,
      which fell on Tuesday, the day in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Clarence
      Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver accepted Bucke's date, and Edwin Haviland Miller
      cited Gohdes and Silver (see <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections:
         Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina:
      Duke University Press, 1949], 192–194; Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:365). The House of Representatives voted to impeach President Andrew Johnson
      on February 24, 1868, the day preceding this letter, and Louisa refers
      approvingly to a speech by Thaddeus Stevens just before the vote. George
      Washington Whitman had offered to make a bet on whether Johnson would be
      impeached the previous day. This letter was written on the Tuesday that followed
      the impeachment vote, February 25, 1868.<a href="#r1">[back]

      term for a northern Democrat who opposed the Civil War.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00517_n9">4. George Washington Whitman
      would have won his bet. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's interest in impeachment was
      primarily with events of national significance, but she and George were also
      anxious that impeachment could affect Walt Whitman's employment as a clerk in
      the office of the attorney general (see her  letter to Walt). The United States House of
      Representatives brought articles of impeachment against President Andrew Johnson
      on February 24, 1868. The precipitating event was the removal from office of
      Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton (1814–1869) three days earlier ("Letter
      from Andrew Johnson to the Senate," in <em>Papers of Andrew
         Johnson</em>, ed. Paul H. Bergeron, et al. [Knoxville: University of
      Tennessee Press, 1996], 13:575). Johnson advocated leniency toward states in the
      former Confederacy, but Stanton, who had served under Abraham Lincoln, actively
      supported the more stringent policies of the Republican Congress (William B.
      Skelton, "Stanton, Edwin McMasters," <em>American National
         Biography Online</em>).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00517_n1">5. "Whispers of Heavenly
      Death," a collection of five poems, was published in <em>The
         Broadway, A London Magazine</em> 10 (October 1868), 21–22. See <a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00517_n11">6. Walt Whitman acknowledged
      receipt of a request for material from George Routledge &amp; Sons, the New York
      office for the publisher of <em>The Broadway, A London
         Magazine</em>, in his 
      letter. In the letter's endorsement, Whitman wrote, "I sent 'Whispers of
      Heavenly Death' which they printed &amp; paid handsomely for in gold." Whitman
      acknowledged receipt of the payment in his  letter to Routledge &amp; Sons.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00517_n17">7. See William D. O'Connor,
      "The Ballad of Sir Ball," <em>Galaxy</em> 5 (March 1868),
      328–334. O'Connor had recommended Walt Whitman to William Conant C. Church
      and Francis P. Church, publishers of the <em>Galaxy</em>. For
      Whitman's work in the magazine, see "."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00470_n8">8. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
      and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">9. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">10. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">11. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00517_n14">12. William Tecumseh Sherman
      (1820–1891), one of the most successful Union generals of the Civil War,
      succeeded Ulysses S. Grant as the commanding general of the Union Army. In
      August 1865, the city of St. Louis presented Sherman a gift of $30,000 to buy a
      house in the city, and he purchased a house on Garrison Avenue near the corner
      of Franklin ("A Gift to General Sherman," <em>New York Times</em>,
      March 18, 1866, 1).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00517_n4">13. Fanny Van Nostrand, called
      "Aunt Fanny" in the letters of Walt Whitman and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, is
      the mother of Ansel Van Nostrand, who married Walt Whitman's younger sister
      Mary. Mary Van Nostrand had written on February 16, 1868 that Ansel's mother
      "cannot live." Louisa reported Aunt Fanny's recent death in her  letter to Walt. Clarence Gohdes and
      Rollo G. Silver tentatively dated Mary Van Nostrand's letter to 1867, but
      Louisa's  letter to Walt dates
      firmly to 1868, so Gohdes and Silver's provisional date for Mary's letter is
      incorrect. For the letter from Mary on Aunt Fanny's expected death, see Gohdes
      and Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts
         of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University
      Press, 1949], 206–207. For Walt Whitman's remark on Aunt Fanny, see his
       letter to Louisa.<a href="#r13">[back]

   <p id="duk.00517_n18">14. On February 24, 1868,
      Representative Thaddeus M. Stevens (1792–1868) of Pennsylvania, a leader
      of the Radical Republicans, gave the final speech during the debate just before
      the House of Representatives passed the resolution to impeach Andrew Johnson
      ("Washington: Debate in the House on the Impeachment Resolution," <em>New York Times</em>, February 25, 1868, 1).<a href="#r14">[back]
