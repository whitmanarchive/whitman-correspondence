   <p>Cloudy &amp; wet yet—Am feeling fairly—the rain has kept me in lately of
      course—last night fair sleep—for breakfast small mutton chop &amp; br'd
      &amp; coffee—am sitting now by the fire (you can both imagine it
      all)—the Blasius people<sup><a href="#loc.07849_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> sent over yesterday to ask
      whether we wanted to "count the tickets" in the boxes first, as they were going to
      clear out &amp; destroy them—I sent word that as far as I was concern'd I sh'd
      not come for any such purpose, &amp; they might clear out &amp; destroy for all
      me—have had some visitors—(am the <em>object</em> of some cranks &amp; lunatics
      among the rest)—grip on me palpably yet—the temperature getting colder
      here—I enclose the printed slip sent by Wallace<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r2">2</a></sup>,
      England<sup><a href="#loc.07849_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—also the Hort: Hall note—Horace,
      we all miss y'r evn'g calls here—So I suppose you have taken in
      Niagara—the Lakes and the St Lawrence too are not to be despised—Best
      respects &amp; remembrances to Dr Beemer<sup><a href="#loc.07330_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; to Dick
      Flynn<sup><a href="#loc.07849_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; to half a dozen more friends
      there—As I look out of the window the last of autumn appears plainer than
      ever.

   <p><em>Correspondents:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<br><br>Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<br></p>

   <p id="n6121">2. James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt

      the "Refractory Building" at Bucke's asylum. Whitman met Beemer during his visit
      there in the summer of 1880. See James H. Coyne, <em>Richard
