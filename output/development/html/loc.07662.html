   <p>Your good letters come daily—I had quite set on sending you the mare &amp; phæton<sup><a href="#n4172" id="r2">2</a></sup> but
      when I saw (&amp; saw clearly) the situation I resigned to give the scheme up &amp; have

      plan or art-design I guess—mystified to me so far—Osler<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r9">9</a></sup> is still away—expect him
      back every day—Tennyson<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r10">10</a></sup> sent me his <em>Cordial best greetings</em> by H G—he is well—&amp; I

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4172">2. In September 1885, Whitman received
      a horse ("Nettie") and a phæton as a gift from a group of prominent
      friends, and he used the horse and carriage for three years. A photo is
      available <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/image092.html">here</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07662_n5">3. Reverend J. Leonard Corning
      was a Unitarian minister in Camden, New Jersey, who often visited Whitman at the
      poet's Camden home.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07662_n2">4. Whitman was paid $130
      on September 7, 1888 by the Rev. J. Leonard Corning, a frequent visitor during
      the poet's illness (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection

   <p id="n4146">5. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel (1856–1914), was
      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on his relationship with Whitman, see

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">6. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

      self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to 1872,
      editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden many
      times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier bust by
      Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan, <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art, 1850–1920</em>

      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on

   <p id="n0625">10. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r10">[back]

      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's

      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
