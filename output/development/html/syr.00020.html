      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I sent you today by express the picture of Lord Bacon by Vandyck I mentioned some
      little time ago.<sup><a href="#syr.00020_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I hope you will like it. It is the only
      picture of Bacon I ever saw without the hat. I felt surer than ever when I saw that
      Olympian forehead that this was the  author of Shakespeare. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I wish the picture was a steel engraving, instead of wood, but it was the only one
      eligible. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Give it a place on your wall. </p>
   
   <p> The <u>Manhattan</u> is going to be revived shortly and is to
      print my paper, called "Hamlet's Note-Book", the one giving R. G. White a going
      over,<sup><a href="#syr.00020_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> of which I wrote  you some time ago. The editor
      writes me a letter so unqualified in panegyric of the article that I am astonished.
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I am just having a temporary respite from the worst spell of work ever laid on me.
      Soon it will begin again. 
   </p>

      Faithfully,
      <br></br>W.D. O'Connor.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="syr.00020_n2">2. O'Connor understood his book
      as a "Baconian reply to R. G. White," a literary critic and scholar who argued
      that Shakespeare was not a pseudonym of Francis Bacon but indeed a separate
      historic figure and author. After numerous publishers had declined O'Connor's
      manuscript, it was finally published in 1886 by Houghton, Mifflin and Company
      (Boston and New York). See also O'Connor's letter to Whitman of .<a href="#r2">[back]
