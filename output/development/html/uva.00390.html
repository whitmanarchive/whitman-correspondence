   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00390_n1">1. According to his
      Commonplace Book, Whitman sent a note on December 12 to George W. Childs
      (1824–1894), co-owner of the <em>Philadelphia Public
         Ledger</em>; and on December 17 he received "50 from G W C for the drivers'
      gloves" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). At Christmas Whitman
      sent gloves to friends, relatives, and various drivers. He apparently had enough
      gloves to give them as presents again in 1881. This draft letter appears on the
      verso of notes for "A County Auction."<a href="#r1">[back]
