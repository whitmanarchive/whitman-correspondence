      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I send herewith, by book post, a short poem called "The Great Peace–Maker," which
      I
      have just edited for private distribution.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As a constant reader and great admirer of your poetry, I have had the idea that the
      practical element in
      this poem, and also its fervent aspiration after the good of mankind, may commend
      themselves to you,—while a poem more like the rest of our contemporary verse
      might not.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Believe me to be
      <br></br>dear sir
      <br></br>faithfully yours,
      <br></br>H. Buxton Forman
      <br></br><br xmlns="">Walt Whitman Esq
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>P. S.
      I
      have been a long time trying to persuade one or another of our publishers to
      print a complete English edition of your works—verbatim, without any
      retrenchments; and I have gone so far as to offer my poor services in
      justifying, as far as criticism can justify poetry, those portions which they
      take exception to, <u>or fear to print</u>. Supposing I
      ultimately succeeded, would a verbatim reprint of the latest edition, with an
      introductory essay, have your approval?
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Henry Buxton Forman (1842–1917) was most
      notably the biographer and editor of Percy Shelley and John Keats. On , Buxton sent a copy of R. H.
      Horne's <em>The Great Peace-Maker; A Sub-marine Dialogue</em>
      (London, 1872) to Whitman. This poetic account of the laying of the Atlantic
      cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death, Forman's reputation
      declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham Pollard and John Carter
      published <em>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth
         Century Pamphlets</em>, which exposed Forman as a forger of many first
      "private" editions of poetry.
