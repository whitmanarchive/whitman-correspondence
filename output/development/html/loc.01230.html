      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A few weeks ago I sent you a book of mine—Moses: a drama. It is an effort to
      represent the character of one who being far beyond his time has conceived a new
      idea, a new development for mankind, and by the very force with which he has
      conceived it wills to shape out, and shapes out, the way of its
      realisation—standing himself all the while alone, solitary, upon earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I hope it may be some pleasure to you to
      read it, if only that I may pay part of the debt I owe you for your writings.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I write this, having just had put into my hands a letter from Moncure Conway written
       after a visit to
      you at Camden. Is it true that no American publisher will issue your works? While
      reading your writings I have thought the future for which you looked quite close,
      but then one goes out into the world and hears such things as this and sees the
      general drift of men's minds towards commonplaceness &amp; conventional estimates of
      things, and then the future looks far—beyond all attainment as indeed I
      believe in some sense it is—and it seems only cruel that men (some) should be
      born to breathe their lives out after a mere visionary beauty. Will it ever be that
      human love—strong to meet with adventurous joy all chance &amp;
      change—will cease to be a [
      <span class="unclear">mere?</span>]
      
      name? that men will 'understand',—eat of the tree of knowledge of good &amp;
      evil, and so be immortal?.. How strange  it is! I know that it must be, I see it
      everywhere—in face after face in the streets, in the sound of men's voices and
      in their silence—clear, unmistakeable, as if just about to be disclosed, the
      divine everywhere–equal life; and yet the children die, hardly knowing what
      they have sought yet knowing that they have not found it, and their dreams fade
      away, and to long suffering succeeds rest, and still the distance remains
      immeasurable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      All is resumed. As soon
      as I remember <u>what</u> the end is—however great the
      distance—I do not doubt. It is quite [
      <span class="unclear">sure?</span>]
      —even as it is truly present with us now
      underlying all thought, &amp; these words. Dear friend, you <u>have</u> so infused yourself that it is daily more &amp; more possible for men
      to walk hand  in hand
      over the whole earth. As you have given your life, so others will after
      you—freely, with amplest reward transcending all suffering—for the end
      that you have dreamed. In the midst of the ferment of this age of material &amp;
      mechanical intercommunion you have planted the seed of a spiritual union &amp;
      identity above all space &amp; time, 
      wh.
      
       yet shall use the spaces &amp; times of this earth (while it endures) for
      its manifestation and expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      What
      have we dreamed? a union which even now binds us closer than all thought—high
      up above all individual gain &amp; loss,—an individual self which stands out
      firm &amp; distinct, most solid of all facts, commensurate with all
      existence,— love disclosing each ever more &amp; more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      See, you have made the earth sacred for me.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Meanwhile they say that your writings are 'immoral' : and you have to defend yourself
      against people who will misunderstand your defence as they misunderstood your
      original words. Need I say that I do not agree with them in the least?. I believe
      on
      the contrary that you have been the first to enunciate the law of purity &amp;
      health which sooner or later must assert itself. After ages perhaps man will return
      <u>consciously</u> to the innocent joyous delight in his own
      natural powers &amp; instincts which characterised the early civilizations. I do not
      understand what it is to be 'shocked' by these things : it seems to me childish. But
      in the meantime it is certain that people do not understand. In some way or other
      our modern 
      civ<u>n</u>
      
       has become narrowed  &amp; onesided. People's minds are dwarfed : one portion of their
      nature grows up in the dark (&amp; ceases to be healthy). Men have lost the freedom
      (free masonry) of Nature, and are plagued with insane doubts of their duty. For a
      time I suppose men must grow up in swaddling bands of morality, and a certain
      instinct makes them cling to them till they have grown to be greater than, &amp;
      masters of, morality. But I think indeed the time has come for people to learn to
      unwrap these bands, and that from this time there will be a world–wide growth
      in the direction you have pointed out.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So while I regret sometimes that there are things in your writings which make it
      difficult, sometimes impossible, to  commend them to some who might otherwise profit by them, yet I
      feel it is best that they 
      sh<u>d</u>
      
       be there. Their presence delays the understanding &amp; acceptation of
      your message, but your message would not be complete without it, and slowly,
      gradually, increasingly without end, its grandeur will dawn upon men.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You are saying something on this subject in your Two Rivulets which I look forward
      to
      seeing. Can I obtain a copy through you, or have you an agent in London?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I feel that my work is to carry on what you have begun. You have opened the way :
      my
      only desire is to go onward in it. If it is out of all question to suppose that one
      generation  or ten
      generations will make <u>much</u> difference in men's minds in
      the direction of the ideal state, still to contemplate that ideal &amp; to live
      slowly translating it into real life &amp; action is quite certainly the only
      good—and is sufficient. I do not think of anything that I have done except as
      preparation ; on all hands the words seem to me to be flowing in but exactly in what
      shape they will issue forth again I am not quite clear, and I think it is my
      business to wait yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Meanwhile there is
      a wonderful new life springing up here in England. I have been this &amp; last
      winter at Leeds doing something in the way of lecturing &amp; teaching, and have
      seen a certain amount of the working [illegible]
      &amp;c. There is 
      undoubtedly an entirely new (social) state of affairs coming about through their
      rise, and I hail it with delight, for the wealthier classes though they struggle for
      light are hopelessly bound in conventionality, and the rough experience of their
      contact with the rude 
      unaccomodating
      
       life below them (during the next few years) will be salvation to them. I
      am very anxious to see America, partly for my own sake—to breathe a less
      conventional atmosphere ; partly for the sake of <u>seeing</u>
      the people &amp; appreciating the life that is growing up in them, for I find that
      no general account, or seeing this other man's eyes, helps me towards that, and I
      have no  friend whose
      opinion I am willing to be guided by in the matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I should go probably this next April, if it were not for the
      Philadelphia Exhibition—which makes me hesitate. Partly
      because it will increase the expense considerably, and partly because on account of
      the turmoil one will perhaps not see so much either of people in general &amp; their
      ways or of individuals as at another time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      If I thought that one occasion would give me a better chance of seeing you than
      another I should be guided by that, but on the other hand I fear to plague
      you—and I daresay you 
       are tormented enough
      by people already ; so I will not [illegible] as I have in [illegible] of a d[illegible] the end of [illegible] for you to [illegible]—and t[illegible]
   </p>
   
   <p>[illegible]I think or fancy that you are
      happy in your surroundings and am glad to think so. Will you tell me—you see I
      am not satisfied yet—where a photograph of yourself is obtainable? I am very
      anxious to have one. And will you forgive me for wearying you—if I have done
      so—with perhaps needless talk  about myself, &amp; believe me
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).
