      <br></br><br></br>Dear William—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Come down a moment &amp; have lunch with me—a biscuit &amp; a glass of 
      wine &amp; water—&amp; tell me about Nelly's getting off—I fully intended 
      to be round this morning, &amp; accompany her &amp; you to the cars—but overslept myself—I
      was quite vexed at it.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Come immediately—</p>

   <p id="nyp.00275_n1">1. The contents of this note
      are too brief and indefinite to make dating certain. It could, for example,
      refer to any one of a number of publishing ventures in the period between 1865
      and 1867, either O'Connor's or Whitman's.<a href="#r1">[back]
