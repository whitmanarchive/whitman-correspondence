   <p>Mr. Cummins has called upon me, bringing me your note of 17th &amp; we have had quite
      a talk —he seems to be a wide‑awake, candid young man, &amp; makes a good impression upon
      me.  He spoke of you, of his own affairs &amp; fortunes, of Idaho, of Judge Kelly Holbrook,
      &amp;c. &amp;c.—In 
      
      
      
      respect to Judge Kelly, &amp; his matter, I had already formed my opinion &amp; made out my
      Report several days ago—The Attorney General is full of anxiety &amp; debate, on the big
      things that are up, just now, —&amp; has not been able to hear the Report, &amp; decide upon
      it—but he told me this morning he would try to do so very shortly—If he decides as
      I have advised him, you &amp; Cummins will have no reason to be dissatisfied.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>—Dear friend, I rec'd your note when you left here—it was sent on to me at Brooklyn.—I value George Alfred
      Townsend's appreciation of L. of G. It was magnificent. Where is Townsend now?—I hope it may happen one day that I may
      have him near at hand, that we get to be friends—such is in my mind.—There is nothing
      new in my affrairs—all goes on as
      
      
      usual in the office.  I am well.  After a hot spell of a week, during the last of
      June, we have had the finest kind of weather here the most of this month—[

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Hiram J. Ramsdell (1839–1887) was a clerk in
      Washington; in a hospital notebook (Henry E. Huntington Library), Walt Whitman
      called him "chief clerk."Ramsdell was the Washington correspondent for the New
      York <em>Tribune</em> and the Cincinnati <em>Commercial</em>. On , Ramsdell
      reported the high praise that George Townsend, the journalist (1841–1914),
      accorded to Walt Whitman—"a stupendous genius," "the song of a God." On
      , he asked Walt Whitman to do
      whatever he could for Judge Milton Kelly, of Idaho, against whom charges had
      been brought by "a very bad man," Congressman Edward Dexter Holbrook
      (1836–1870), a Democrat from the Idaho Territory. Actually, on July 12,
      1867, Walt Whitman had submitted to the Attorney General a "Report on the <em>Charges</em> submitted by <em>Hon. E. D.
         Holbrook</em>, Del[egate] from Idaho Terr[itory], <em>against</em>
      <em>Hon. Milton Kelly</em>, Asso[ciate] Just[ice] Supreme Court of
      Idaho" (National Archives). To this forty-one page summary of the evidence, all
      in Walt Whitman's hand, there is appended a letter signed by attorney general
      Henry Stanbery (1803–1881) but written by Walt Whitman, dated July 20,
      1867: "The Conclusion in the preceding Report is hereby adopted by me, &amp;
      ordered to stand as the decision of this Office in the Case, so far as now
      presented." On July 22, 1867, Ramsdell apologized for his "aggressiveness."
      (Ramsdell's letters are in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.) Judge Kelly
      wrote to Walt Whitman on June(?) 21, 1867 (National Archives), and again on  (Yale). On November 15, 1875,
      Ramsdell, among others, petitioned Benjamin H. Bristow (1832–1896),
      Secretary of the Treasury, that Walt Whitman "be appointed to a position in the
      Treasury Department" (National Archives).
