   <p></span><span>It is the earnest desire of Mr. Beecher's friends that this memorial shall be in every

       of such a
      character that it may ever remain a notable record of his life to be referred to in
      future years by his family and his friends.

   <p></span><span>From promises and contributions received, the high character of the Memorial is
      already assured, but we fully recognize the positive advantage it would receive by
      some tribute from your pen. We are therefore particularly hopeful of a favorable
      response at your hands, and this we most earnestly solicit.

   <p></span><span>As it is desired that the memorial be issued at as early a date as possible, may I

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Eduard Willem Gerard Cesar
      Hidde Bok (1863–1930), commonly known as Edward Bok, was a Dutch-American
      author and newspaperman, and editor of the <em>Ladies' Home
         Journal</em>. Like Whitman, Bok had also worked for the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0066">1. Henry Ward Beecher (1813–1887), Congregational
      clergyman and brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, accepted the pastorate of the
      Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, in 1847. Whitman described him briefly in the
      Brooklyn <em>Daily Advertiser</em> of May 25, 1850, reprinted in
      <em>The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman</em>, 2
      vols., ed. by Emory Holloway, I, 234–235; see also <em>I Sit
         and Look Out</em>, 84–85, and Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 1:137–138. His father,
      Lyman Beecher (1775–1863), was also a clergyman, who upon his retirement
      lived with his son in Brooklyn.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01087_n2">2. The monument, created by
      John Quincy Adams Ward, opened to the public on June 24, 1891. There is no
      record of a possible involvement by Whitman, and if he ever replied to Bok, his
      letter is not extant.<a href="#r2">[back]
