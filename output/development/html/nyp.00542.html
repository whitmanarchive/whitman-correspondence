   <p>The picture arrived this morning—it is a splendid piece of work &amp; I feel
      sure a good likeness—At any rate it is that rare bird a perfect photo—&amp; I am mighty
      glad to get it—it leans against the wall before me
      this moment with <em>the Bacon</em>—(I am ashamed to say never
      before acknowledged—but it is in my little sitting room &amp; before my eyes
      every day—more than half the time is taken for Shakspere)<sup><a href="#nyp.00542_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am about as well as usual in general health—full as well—but laid by
      with lameness—added to by a fall two months ago &amp; turning my ankle in. I
      hear from Dr Bucke and John Burroughs—both well—Doctor busy as a
      bee—both vehement in hospitable invitations to me which I should be most glad
      to accept—but I find it best not to stray too far from my own chair &amp;
      bed<sup><a href="#nyp.00542_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Mrs Gilchrist has a strong article abt L.
      of G. &amp;c printed in the "To-day," cheap radical English magazine for
      June—I shall probably have some soon &amp; will send you one—It is equal
      to the 1872 piece<sup><a href="#nyp.00542_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>How are you? Any prospect of decapitation?<sup><a href="#nyp.00542_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> How is Nelly?
      Give my best love &amp; remembrances to her? I am comfortable here in my shanty. I
      suppose you get the papers &amp; pieces I send—<em>So long</em>, dear friend—
