      <br></br><br></br>My dear dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your altogether good letter came to hand 
      yesterdy
      
       morn: old, new, and genial. Nothing like a ducking—apropos of your
      journey to Kirkwood amid the pouring rain—nothing like a ducking I say to
      make a fellow appreciate sunshine, the old story light and shade—: By jove
      though we 
      havent
      
       seen the sun here for one, two, three, four days: a solid 
      impenetrable white mist shutting that divine element away from our view: we are like
      blind men for the time and turn our eyes inward &amp; trust to an inward  mental something
      as a substitute for the sun.
   </p>
   
   <p>You say Glendale woods are wintry &amp; bare, but there is no such 
      colour
      
       as is to be met with as in winter landscape so full and varied where the
      hungry eye rests upon a dash of emerald green with startled pleasure and is amazed
      at the depth of hue in the leafless twigs &amp; branches of myriads of trees.
   </p>
   
   <p>The chiming of church bells float musically up Haverstock Hill greeting my ears
      pleasantly as I sit here in our pretty drawing-room writing this. I shall be sorry
      when nations no longer go to church &amp; church
      
      
      
      bells cease chiming, but I needn't worry for it wont be in my time any how.
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish too that you could send me some cedar branches thick with the china-blue little
      plums strange, I have no recollection of such things in America. Yes, I have glanced
      at the Guiteau trial
      curious isn't it?
   </p>
   
   <p>The surroundings at Glendale suit you when you are there I am glad, you are in
      relation with that which is in harmony with you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother is ill in bed to day but will be better by and bye—Giddy is only pretty well—a Miss Beely Giddie's friend
      is staying with us, Carpenter introduced her to us.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Carpenter stayed a few days with us a week or two ago, &amp; was looking very
      flourishing has grown a beard which becomes him, he has given up lecturing, for
      little gardening and a little literature and a little democratic sociableness etc:
      Friday evening Henry Holmes—one on the first violinists here in London very
      good-naturedly volunteered to stand to me for a picture of Consuelo &amp;
      Hayden playing at the canons window; so that I am painting I shall get the proper professional
      twist in the
      handling of the violin besides he has explained the good points 
      wch
      
       a violin should possess: as a musician he praises the conception of my picture and
      seems interested
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The women think that Carpenter is not looking well.</p>
