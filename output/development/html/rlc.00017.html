   <p>I have been spending the summer in Canada, especially on the Lakes, &amp; the Thousand
      Islands, &amp; the river St Lawrence—have jaunted leisurely over 3000 miles—It is a singularly
      healthy, beautiful interesting country, this Canada, (it is as large as the U S—population,
      4½ millions, very advanced, very sound, a good race, ⅔ds English ⅓ French)—I am now
      on my way home to Camden—address me there as formerly—I am unusually well for a half-paralytic—
