      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>William is on his way to Bar Harbor, Maine, care Dr. Kinnear, Wall's cottage. 
      Wm.
      
       was disposed to try Dr. K. as soon as he heard of his method, which is Dr.
      Chapman's, with which 
      Wm.
      
       was familiar, applications  of heat &amp; cold to the
      spine.<sup><a href="#loc.02947_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Probably 
      Wm.
      
       wrote you, he said he should, when he read your letter to me. The Ashtons
      were very anxious to have him try Dr. Kinnear, &amp; William feels that he ought—to
      try any one who gives him reasonable assurance of help. He says he wants "either his
      legs, or <u>wings</u>," as locomotion of some  sort is
      desirable. 
   </p> 
   
   <p>I write at this moment to ask you to please <u>not tell any one
         where 
         Wm. 
         
          is,</u> I mean not any one who will speak of it, he asked me to
      caution all the friends; above all he says <u>don't let it get
         into the papers</u>, for already some vile creatures are grumbling at his
      vacation; so you 
      will kindly bear it in mind. Mr. Kimball<sup><a href="#loc.02947_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> thought he
      better not let it be known. He (W.) said he should make Dr. K. tell him at once
      whether he could help him. He shows a deal of energy in starting off as he does,
      &amp; as to his courage it is simply <u>sublime</u>, &amp; he
      puts all my <u>theoretical</u> trust to shame by his practical
      application  of
      it. A friend here offered to go all the way to Bar Harbor with him, but he said it
      was all "nonsense", that he found plenty of people ready to jump to help him, his
      crutch is very appealing, &amp; now he uses that &amp; his cane <u>both</u>. At any rate, he is out of this awful heat &amp; sultriness. I hope
      you keep up under it. To-day it is  raining here, for the first time. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Walt, the other day I found a package of letters belonging to you carefully put
      away, the Rossetti<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r3">3</a></sup> correspondence, &amp; as a part of history
      valuable, &amp; I return them to you to-day by this mail, but in another &amp; large
      envelope. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Let me hear from you soon if you get them  safely. I send all but had to
      separate the bundle, as it was too thick for my envelope. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor
      was the wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Walt Whitman's
      staunchest defenders. Walt may have mentioned a potential visit by Nelly and her
      daughter during his May visit to Brooklyn, though whether a visit came near this
      time is not known from his or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters. Walt Whitman
      dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington years, and he spoke
      often in his letters of their daughter Jean (called "Jenny" or "Jeannie").
      Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break off their friendship in late
      1872 over a disagreement about Reconstruction policies and the role of
      emancipated slaves, Nelly would remain friendly with Whitman. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02947_n1">1. Apparently O'Connor
      attempted to keep his stay with Dr. Kinnear a secret. The "Dr. Chapman"
      O'Connor's wife is referring to is likely Nathaniel Chapman (1780–1853),
      the founding president of the American Medical Association who argued that
      certain diseases could be caused by "augmented or diminished . . . animal heat"
      (<em>Elements of Therapeutics and Materia Medica</em>
      [Philadelphia: Carey and Lea, 1823], 124).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02947_n2">2. Sumner Increase Kimball
      (1834–1923), the superintendent of the United States Life-Saving Service
      and employer of O'Connor.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">3. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
