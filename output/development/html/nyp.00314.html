      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will not write much to-day, as I have just come in from being out over two hours,
      
      &amp; I feel quite tired. I cannot walk any to speak of, but I have been out taking a
      
      ride in the cars, and sitting in the parks a little while. Peter Doyle has been with
      me. 
      It is as pleasant and warm as summer here to-day. I have not rec'd any letters for
      the last two days—
      I suppose you got my letter Saturday—I have been out more to-day than any day yet,
      
      as it has been so warm &amp; fine—Love to you, mama dear, &amp; to all—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Mother, write me what envelopes you would like to have me direct, &amp; enclose you—
      I have not been over to the office yet, except that one time ten or twelve days ago.
      
   </p>
