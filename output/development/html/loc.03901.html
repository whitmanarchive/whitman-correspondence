      <br></br><br></br>My dear friends
      
   </p>
   
   <p>You 
      havn't
      
       sent for the two big books Herbert sent you, so as I have been snowed in a
      good deal lately, I have opened them &amp; read quite a good deal in them—they
      are queer books, the very finest of printing &amp; paper &amp; some odd pictures<sup><a href="#loc.03901_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I got a postal from Mrs Gilchrist
      yesterday—she is improving—the rest all well—
   </p>
   
   <p>—We have had a rough hard winter, all around—Keeps me in mostly, but I make a
      dash out now &amp; then—I still keep pretty well this winter—if it
      hadn't been so cold I should have been down to see you—Ed how do you like
      being home again? But I think you are contented most any where—how is the
      nag? I was out once or twice sleighing—my brother took me—his mare
      Nelly is in fine condition—pretty lively—makes things fly
      sometimes
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been in all day reading &amp; writing—I have put up two sets of my
      books, to send off this evening's mail, to purchasers<sup><a href="#loc.03901_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—a very quiet day, but I have enjoyed it—outside it is cold and
      half-cloudy, not an inviting day out—
   </p>
   
   <p>—Well Mont have you found any chance yet at telegraphing? I think the best thing a
      fellow can do this weather, is to stay home &amp; keep warm,—but when the
      spring opens then make a dash somewhere—Van I suppose will make a
      farmer—well if he is satisfied, it is about as good as anything, I don't know
      but better—
   </p>
   
   <p>There comes my call to dinner, &amp; I shall go for it
      without delay &amp; finish my helter-skelter letter afterwards.
   </p>
   
   <p><u>Dinner all right</u>, baked beef pie—I am now going out to see one of the ferry men a friend, very sick,—I
      have
      provided a bottle of brandy to take him, as I understand the doctor orders milk
      punch—there is a good deal of sickness around here, much diphtheria—Well
      I must stop—Good bye &amp; Good bless you friends Susan, George, &amp; Harry
      dear—
   </p>
