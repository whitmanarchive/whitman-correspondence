      The conviction that I am
      the least and latest of all
      poets gives me courage to
      write to you who are so far
      beyond me in years, honors,
      knowledge and—most pathetic
      of all in one sense—the world's
      laurelled acceptance.

      "When lilacs last in dooryards bloomed"
      I was reading from papers of yours
      in Colonel Romey's <u>Progress</u>. I
      then wrote to him a little prose
      sonnet trying to tell how much
      
      pleasure I crowded into
      those brief readings. There
      was a short poem of yours
      "Italian Music in Dakota"
      which has always been to
      me like a saunter through
      spicy, summer-warm woods,
      when the brooks were low-voiced 
      under the alders, and
      the air was heavy with not
      yet escaped storm bursts.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Before the window where I
      do my morning work, there is
      an old lilac tree, dating from
      my grandmother's youth—and
      when in spring it is strong but
      proud, bearing great clusters of
      purple bloom, and I think always
      of you and your lines,
      heavy with [
      <span class="unclear">tears?</span>]
      , while you
      throw your lilac boughs on
      the martyr President's coffin.
      <u>That</u> is noble! The voice
      you speak with there!
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      If I had written anything
      to compare, even so slightly with
      this noble and rugged harmony
      of your verse, I would send 
      it to you with this, asking
      you to read it and recognize it
      as from one of the youngest, the
      least aspiring of the children
      who follow and look up to you.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Won't you send me a line
      with your name? There!
      I have dared to ask much.
      
      Forgive my assurance, and,
      if possible give me that
      pleasure of that great recompense
      for being so unknown.

      I have been reading Mr
      Stedman's article in the Nov.
      Scribner—it must be pleasant
      to have such friends, and
      such appreciation. I have
      read too your views in the
      North American Review on
      The Poetry of the Future.
