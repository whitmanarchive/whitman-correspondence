   <p>Yours of yesterday 
      rec'd—I had heard nothing of the Boston P. M.
      action—(it is not some mistake?—As you describe it?)<sup><a href="#nyp.00456_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—The price of the book such a volume as I sent you
      is $3—I sent one to Prof. Loomis<sup><a href="#nyp.00456_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—The heat
      here to-day has been awful, but I seem to stand it well—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00456_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd June 29/82." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service Bureau
      | Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Camden | Jun (?) | 26 | 7 AM | N.J.;
      Washington | Jun | 26 | 5 M(?) | (?).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00456_n2">2. June 25 was on Sunday in
      1882. The year is also confirmed by the notes below.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00456_n3">3. On  O'Connor reported that the Boston
      postmaster had halted a lecture by George Chainey on <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914], 3:349). Obviously he meant
      the sending of the printed lecture through the mail (see the letter from Whitman
      to George Chainey of ).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00456_n4">4. After O'Connor's request
      on , Whitman sent the volume on June 20 to
      Professor Elias Loomis (1811–1889), the astronomer and Yale professor, who
      at the time was in the Nautical Almanac Office of the Navy Department in
      Washington (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
      According to O'Connor's letter of , Loomis
      knew that Emerson had never qualified his praise of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> (Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906], 1:313).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00456_n5">5. O'Connor "judged it
      prudent to withhold my reply to 'Sigma.'"<a href="#r5">[back]
