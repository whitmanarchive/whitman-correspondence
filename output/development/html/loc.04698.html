      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Just a few lines in acknowledgment of your very kind and affectionate post card of
      Jan: 27th<sup><a href="#loc.04698_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> addressed to Dr Johnston<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      &amp; received yesterday.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      It's
      
       most important sentence, to us, is that referring to yourself. (I continue
      rather poorly. End uncertain)<sup><a href="#loc.04698_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>And we shall be very anxious indeed till we hear further &amp; <u>better</u> news. I do hope that you are better by this time, &amp; am looking
      forward to the receipt of a message from Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup>.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I got today a copy of this month's "<u>Magazine of Art</u>", which
      I will send on to you with this. It contains some additional &amp; later
      portraits
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>of Ruskin<sup><a href="#n3013" id="r5">5</a></sup>, which will perhaps interest you. But the writer has
      to end by saying that Ruskin's "portrait—his true portrait—does not
      exist. It could not exist."<sup><a href="#loc.04698_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I wish I could send you something more but must content myself, for the present, with
      saying that our loving sympathy &amp; best wishes are with you always.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="n3013">5. John Ruskin (1819–1900) was
      one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
      via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
      of ). Ruskin, according to Whitman,
      expressed "<em>worry</em> [...] that [<em>Leaves</em> is] <em>too personal</em>, too emotional,
      launched from the fires of [...] spinal passions, joys, yearnings" (see the
      letter from Whitman to William O'Connor of ). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my
      Ruskin with some qualifications." Still, Ruskin "is not to be made little of: is
      of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.4.html">Thursday, January 24, 1889</a>).<a href="#r5">[back]
