      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have not heard from you now for nine days. Your letter of 13th<sup><a href="#loc.01521_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> (last Saturday week,) in which you said 
      the orders were for you to go to work next day, was the last I have received. I took
      it for granted 
      that you went to work, &amp; have been at it since—&amp; I hope all is right with you—but
      why have you not written?—Dear son, if not to work I wish to send you a little money.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Every thing goes well with me—that is, every thing goes as well as can be expected—I
      am feeling first-rate—I am down the bay often, &amp; sometimes spend nearly all day on
      the sea-shore a few miles down—I am all sunburnt &amp; red, &amp; weigh <em>severeal</em> pounds more than when I left Washington—
   </p>
   
   <p>A friend who hasn't seen me 
      for a good while said this morning—"Why Walt you are fatter &amp; saucier than ever"—but I will close by sending 
      my love, to my darling son—&amp; to him I shall always be the same old
      
   </p>

      <br></br>Walt.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
