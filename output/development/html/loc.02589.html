      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I intended writing to you to wish you good bye, but have just heard there is a chance
      of my seeing you next week at Madison Square Theatre,<sup><a href="#loc.02589_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> so
      of course, I shall be there. Will there be any chance of my getting to speak to you?
      If there are to be  any people on the platform by you, &amp; you could get me a place, I should feel
      the honour greatly. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I sincerely hope your jaunt to the theatre with us, &amp; by breaking the monotony, did
      you good. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> has written to me for a little news about you
      &amp; to ask me to see him in town to report all I know. 
   </p>
   
   <p>How beautiful the New York harbour is! I greatly  enjoy seeing the in-coming &amp;
      out-going ships bathed in the clear spring sunlight. I have much to thank you
      for—your works give me hope &amp; joy, while the time spent with you was the
      most gratifying spent in this country. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I intend to write to you from England, &amp; at all times, if I can do anything for
      you, it will most willingly be done. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Praying to God that He will send his blessings upon  you, like rain upon a grand old
      oak. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I remain proud to call myself your admiring friend </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Herbert Kersley was a
      poet, actor, and friend of Oscar Wilde. Apparently he visited Whitman alongside
      Silvanus Dauncey in late January of 1887 when both left their addresses in
      Whitman's daybook before taking the poet and his housekeeper Mary Davis to a
      play in which they performed as part of Wilson Barrett's Company.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02589_n2">1. Whitman gave his Lincoln
      lecture at Madison Square Theatre in New York on April 14, 1887. James B. Pond
      recounts it as follows: "It was indeed a picturesque spectacle at Walt's last
      appearance in the Madison Square Theatre, on Lincoln's birthday. Just as he was
      about to recite 'My Captain,' a little girl, the granddaughter of Edmund
      Clarence Stedman, walked out upon the stage and presented him with a beautiful
      bouquet of roses" (<em>Eccentricities of Genius</em> [New York: G.
      W. Dillingham Co.], 497).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.03310_n1">2. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
