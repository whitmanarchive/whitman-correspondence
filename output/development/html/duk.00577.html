   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00577_n11">1. This letter dates to August
      25, 1868. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter "spring of 1869," and Edwin
      Haviland Miller dated the letter "summer" 1869 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:80, n. 11). Miller's summer 1869 date is impossible: Moses
      Lane resigned the position of Chief Engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works on May
      1, 1869, but this letter refers to the safety of George Washington Whitman's
      position as a pipe inspector so long as Lane remained as the chief engineer
      ("Moses Lane," <em>Proceedings of the American Society of Civil
         Engineers</em> [February 1882], 58). Bucke's spring date is also impossible,
      as Louisa herself refers to "summer" in this letter, and she had noted in April
      1869 that Lane was expected to resign his position after a new water board was
      seated (see her  letter to Walt).
      This letter dates to the previous year, and it followed Walt's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman. This letter responds directly to four matters from Walt's letter: the
      receipt of stamped envelopes, Walt's dissatisfaction with his boarding
      situation, a requested update on George's house, and an acknowledgment that Walt
      has set a date for his coming September leave. Walt dated his August 24 letter
      "Monday forenoon," and Louisa dates this letter "tuesday evening." One day for
      letters between Washington, D.C., and Brooklyn, New York, is common if the
      letter was sent before noon, so this letter dates to August 25, 1868.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00577_n13">2. Walt Whitman enclosed "some
      envelopes—they are already stamped" in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">3. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00577_n17">4. Ebenezer Ray
      (1843?–1902) was a long-time jewelry store owner in Brooklyn. The <em>Brooklyn City Directory</em> (1869) lists him as a jeweler at
      462 Atlantic Avenue.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00577_n19">6. George Washington Whitman
      and "his gal" were on a leisure tour up East River. The steamer departed "Pier
      24, at Peck Slip, foot of Beekman Street, for Glen Cove, L[ong] I[sland]" (<em>Appletons' Hand-Book for American Travel. Northern and Eastern
         Tour</em> [New York: D. Appleton, 1873], 30, 31). Glen Cove, accessible from
      Hempstead, was a "pleasant place for a quiet day's enjoyment[,]" and the village
      of Roslyn was "nestled among green trees and placid lakelets" (36).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00577_n6">7. George Washington Whitman's
      "gal" was probably Louisa Orr Haslam (1842–1892). George and Louisa
      married in spring 1871 and lived in Camden, New Jersey.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00577_n1">8. Moses Lane (1823–82)
      was Chief Engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869 and later
      became City Engineer of Milwaukee. The connection between Lane and Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, who had served under Lane before accepting the
      position of Chief Engineer at the St. Louis Water Works, led to George
      Washington Whitman's employment as a pipe inspector in Brooklyn. Lane resigned
      as Chief Engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works the following year, on May 1, 1869
      ("Moses Lane," <em>Proceedings of the American Society of Civil
         Engineers</em> [February 1882], 58). For more information on Walt Whitman's
      dealings with Lane, see Whitman's 
      letter to Jeff.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">9. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00577_n8">10. Moses Lane resigned as Chief
      Engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works the following year, on May 1, 1869 ("Moses
      Lane," <em>Proceedings of the American Society of Civil
         Engineers</em> [February 1882], 58).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00577_n12">11. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      remark on the contrast between Walt Whitman's generosity and George Washington
      Whitman's spendthrift ways may betray considerable frustration. George had
      received a $510 bank draft from his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman just
      days before, $500 of which was a loan to help George keep his speculative
      housing business financially viable as he awaited the next sale (see Jeff's  letter to George). The extra $10
      was "to mother as a present from Mattie" (Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell Whitman).
      Louisa may not have received the $10 from Mattie before George departed for his
      leisure trip.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00577_n2">12. The house is on the lot at
      1149 Atlantic Avenue, which George Washington Whitman soon purchased outright
      from his partner Smith and to which Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward
      moved in late September (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman and Walt Whitman's  letter to Peter Doyle).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00577_n5">13. Walt Whitman had written, "I
      have not been satisfied with my boarding place—so several weeks ago, I
      tried another place &amp; room for a couple of days &amp; nights on trial,
      without giving up my old room—Well, I was glad enough to go back to my old
      place &amp; stay there" (see his 
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman). The "old room" to which he returned was
      472 M Street South, a boarding house owned by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Newton Benedict. He
      began boarding with the Benedicts in February 1867 (see his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman; also see Kim Roberts, "A Map of Whitman's Washington Boarding Houses
      and Work Places," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 22:1
      [November 2004], 25).<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00475_n11">14. Mustard plasters were a
      mustard paste that was applied to a cloth or paper, which was then applied to
      skin, generally with an intervening layer of cloth or paper. The paste,
      sometimes diluted, was typically applied to the abdomen and was held to relieve
      pain by increasing bloodflow or by drawing excess blood from the inflamed or
      painful area. Mustard, a strong irritant, would produce blisters if allowed to
      remain in contact with skin. See <em>Health at Home, or Hall's
         Family Doctor</em> (Hartford: J. A. S. Betts, 1873), 297.<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00577_n20">15. This postscript is in the
      right margin of the page.<a href="#r15">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00577_n15">16. This note is inverted on
      the first page. Walt Whitman conveyed his mother's remark on the lack of
      visits from the Price family in his  letter to Abby H. Price, in which he also asked if he could
      board at the Price's residence during his leave, a request that she accepted
      (see Walt's  letter).<br><br>
      Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform
      movements. Her husband Edmund operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the
      couple had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in
      1852, at 2 years of age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially
      her daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman and his mother, Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman. In 1860, the Price family began to save Walt's letters.
      Helen's reminiscences of Whitman are included in Richard Maurice Bucke's
      biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay,
      1883), and she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters to her
      mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169).<a href="#r16">[back]
