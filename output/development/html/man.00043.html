       your Postal and am glad you are having such a good time.<sup><a href="#n0336" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Hinton's wife died
      night before last. Poor fellow! he is in the depths, he loved her deeply,
      intensely, she arrived from London only a week ago yesterday, he wishes me to tell
      Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> that as soon as he can turn around he will "<u>Write
         about Walt</u>" have it appear in the Mail perhaps and will make it what the Dr
      needs.
   </p>
   
   <p>Albert graduated all O.K. I question whether he gets to
                       
      Camden this Summer.
      Tell the Dr. that with seven to support, I dont have much surplus to let them go on
      long journeys. Moreover I need him in the store with me, if I go to Colorado next
      month he will look after things here.
   </p>
   
   <p>I will do my best to send the Dr something while I am on my vacation.</p>
   
   <p>Give my love to him, and [

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0336">1. John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n3029">3. Alma Calder Johnston was an author
      and the second wife of John H. Johnston. Her family owned a home and property in
      Equinunk, Pennsylvania. For more on the Johnstons, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>" (<em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
