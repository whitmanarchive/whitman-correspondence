      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter is full of kind<sup><a href="#loc.03617_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; too-flattering [
      <span class="unclear">expressions?</span>]
      , to 
      wh.
      
       please believe that I am not insensible. 
   </p>
   
   <p>If Chatto &amp; Windus<sup><a href="#loc.03617_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> were by any probability to think
      fit to reprint the Criticism on Swinburne,<sup><a href="#n0610" id="r3">3</a></sup> I 
      wd
      
       not have the least objection. It must be remembered however that the
      Criticism relates to a Swinburne of the past, rather considerably different from the
       Swinburne of
      the present, &amp; various reasons might be suggested why reprinting 
      wd.
      
       be regarded as undesirable. I 
      wd.
      
       not myself take any steps in the matter, but leave it for any one else to
      deal with who thinks fit. Have not read the Criticism this longish while past, but
      dare say it is not worse than my other writings. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Swinburne lives now a rather isolated life, away from my part of London. I very
      seldom see him (
      tho
      
       our feelings of friendsship has suffered no abatement), &amp; don't know
      what I 
      cd.
      
       well say to him about "Under the Microscope."<sup><a href="#loc.03617_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> I
      am sure he is no longer <u>enthusiastic</u> about Whitman, &amp;
      I doubt whether he even  likes his writings at all. My own feelings on the subject remain
      unchanged, &amp; I was much pleased at the reissue of my selection—a much
      handsomer volume than the original one. 
   </p>
   
   <p>That Birth-song by Swinburne relates to my eldest daughter: I forget whether there
      is
      any allusion in it directly connecting it with my dedication to Blake; but at any
      rate the young lady came into the world in due course after the [
      <span class="unclear">dedicatee?</span>]
       of the B. &amp;
      myself had become wife &amp; husband. I am happy to say that both my wife &amp; my
      daughter are alive. My wife however has for 1¾ year been an invalid from
      bronchial attacks, &amp; it is only  this very morning that I saw her,
      along with that daughter, &amp; my son, off by train to the Riviera San Reno, or
      perhaps Mentone— where they will remain I dare say till at any rate the end of
      March.
   </p>

      <br></br>Very truly yours,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0610">3. Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) was a
      British poet, critic, playwright, and novelist. He was also one of Whitman's
      earliest English admirers. At the conclusion of <em>William Blake:
         A Critical Essay</em> (1868), 300–303, Swinburne pointed out
      similarities between Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly
      Rocking" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the
      most sweet and sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world." His
      famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America" is included in <em>Songs
         before Sunrise</em> (1871). For the story of Swinburne's veneration of
      Whitman and his later recantation, see two essays by Terry L. Meyers, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00740.pdf">Swinburne and Whitman: Further Evidence</a>," <em>Walt
