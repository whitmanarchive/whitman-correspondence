      <br></br><br></br>My dear Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Since our conversation this morning it seems to me that there is a desire to get the
      weight of your authority to back up certain late works of fiction, which are simply
      <em>nasty</em>, without being in any sense true.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Inasmuch as your friends have all along been contending that the so-called "nude"
      passages in Leaves of Grass are simply expressions of eternal truth, and that their
      purpose is in the direction of a better comprehension of man and of the democratic
      idea, it would (I think) be a misfortune if you were drawn into a seeming
      endorsement of a sort of literature with which Leaves of Grass has nothing in
      common.<sup><a href="#med.00867_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I feel the matter so deeply that I have put my thoughts on paper, and now enclose
      them.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am sure you will not think me impertinent in so doing. If I did not so venerate
      the
      great truth of Leaves of Grass and so love the author, I should not have dared to
      write this.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours always,
      <br></br>F.H. Williams

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00867_n1">1. See William S. Walsh's  letter to Whitman. Apparently, Walsh's
      request for the poet's assessment of the "prevailing tendencies" in current
      fiction, co-signed with James Gordon Bennett of the New York <em>Herald</em>, prompted a discussion with Williams about the distinction
      between mere sensationalism and progressive attitudes toward sex in literature.
      Traubel records Whitman saying: "No one would more rigidly keep in mind the
      difference between the simply erotic, the merely lascivious, and what is frank,
      free, modern, in sexual behaviour, than I would" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.59.html">Wednesday, March 20, 1889</a>.<a href="#r1">[back]
