      The year is established by Nancy M. Johnson's letter to Whitman on , in which she ordered the 1876
      set, as well as by the reference to Whitman's nephew. Whitman sent the

         the War</em> on April 20, 1876 (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg

      Congress, Washington, D.C.); see also Whitman's  letter to Ellen O'Connor and his  letter to Charles Eldridge.
