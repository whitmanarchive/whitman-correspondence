      <br></br>Life-Saving,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">February 20, 1883.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have sent you the <u>MS</u> of my letter to Bucke. It goes this day by Adams' Express,
      addressed to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I sent you a card this morning just before your letter came. There is not the least
      bit of "pestering" in the matter, and of course I appreciate the necessity for
      despatch. I only got
      
      
      the <u>MS</u> from R M. B. on Saturday, and
      set to work revising it the next day. I am so driven with work, and so weary and
      worn, that I cannot always be as quick as I would like to in these offices. The
      collection of my anti-Comstock letters has been positively prevented up to date, by
      simple lack of time. I shall soon have some let up. We have had a horrid fight with
      the Navy, and
      
      
      flaxed them awfully—rousing Congress and the Seaboard upon them. I send you a
      pamphlet, which has some of the shrapnel we swept their decks with. The paper on
      Life-Saving transfer is mine—some touches in the others. I was thinking of you
      when I wrote the first and third of my three reasons against transfer.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am rejoiced that the G. G. P. still seems
      
      good in your eyes. I should be
      glad to leave out some sentences in the last page, and originally intended to, but
      thinking it over, could not see my way clear, inasmuch as the whole publication is
      a
      matter of history, and ought to stand, follies and all, and several of my abusive
      critics at the time quoted the very passages I want to omit, for animadversion,
      which makes it more difficult
      
      
      now to withdraw them. Do you see my dilemma? The sentences
      sending the pamphlet to a number of persons named on the last page, are an
      absurdity, yet I don't see very well how I can honorably back out of it now, and
      escape twitting. How does this view strike you?
   </p>
   
   <p>It was Bucke's wish that I should write the prefaratory letter I send, and I accepted
      the
      
       chance of
      supplementing the pamphlet with a few remarks upon the Harlan transaction; of paying
      my respects to some of your recent critics, teaching them that there are blows to
      take as well as give; and of putting you, where you properly belong, in the line
      of succession from Shakespeare, which will make some of our literati howl. I hope
      you will think it good, and
      
      
      effective. Like everything I write, it has been done in a
      hurry, and without those leisures of the soul which are requisite to satisfactory
      work.
   </p>
   
   <p>I trust it will be in good type. Where is it to go? The pamphlet, of course, belongs
      to the appendix. Let me have proof of all, which I will return promptly.
   </p>
   
   <p>The <u>MS</u>. on copying press paper is my little
      
      
      tilt with Lanman, and should come
      on <u>after</u> the pamphlet in the appendix. Bucke wanted it at first, but in his last
      letter thinks it best to omit it, although he leaves it to me. Now I think it ought
      to go in, as it finishes the Harlan affair handsomely. But do as you think best. It
      is a rather crushing rejoinder to Lanman, and a punishment to Stoddard, who is
      awfully mean, and it has a good effect of <u>tone</u> after the
      fiery pamphlet.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I hope Bucke's book will be a success. It comes in good time. He has a rare chance.
      I
      aimed, also, in my contribution to the volume, to add to its interest and
      attractiveness.
   </p>
   
   <p>I see by the extracts in Sunday's <u>Tribune</u> that you are in the Carlyle and Emerson
      letters. Did you see it? I shall
      
      
      want to see the volume. The
      letter, as printed, is very characteristic of Emerson—his reserve, his
      shrinking, like a woman's, because of rebuff; his deceptive concessions to the
      enemy, in a vein of pleasantry, almost like irony, almost like a sneer, when he says
      the book "wanted good morals so much" that he did not send it. Of
      
      course, some
      people will take a different view. But I think I understand Emerson's real feeling,
      which is in his first letter to you, and there is no denying it.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am suspicious of Professor Norton as an editor of this correspondence. I hope he
      would not suppress things favorable to you, but have little faith in him since I
      read a sketch of his lecture on Greek art, in
      
      
      which he held that the later Greek
      sculpture began to be indecent with nudity—the great or earlier Greek being
      always draped, as in the work of Phidias; which precious assertion made me think of
      the Panathenaic frieze of Phidias where a row of soldiers charges, all naked, and
      the
      phallus in each man not only bare, but erected—stiff with valor—which is
      good for Professor Norton! Selah! I must close. More anon.
