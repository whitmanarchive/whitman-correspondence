      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I got your last, enclosing MS, on the 20th, and at once, as you suggested, sent
      the document to the Sun, copying your draft of note to the editor, &amp;c. Let
      us see if tomorrow's Sun will have it.
   </p>
   
   <p>I infer from your suggestion that you think the article not so bad. Bad or good,
      its publication by the Sun will make Fra Diavolo Godkin howl.
   </p>
   
   <p>I return your Salt Lake City letter about Bacon and Shakespeare, having carefully
      read it thrice. It seems quite crazy—though maybe only crude—yet has
      some good points in it, which I took in.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am in great mourning that I can't get my reply to Richard Grant White on the
      Bacon-Shakespeare matter, printed. It was certainly brilliant, though I
      say it as shouldn't. The North American man called it "so very valuable a
      manuscript," apologizing for declining it on the ground that too much MS has
      already been accepted—which is all gammon. Fanatical prejudice in favor of
      Shakespeare, unwilling to allow discussion, is at the bottom of the matter.
   </p>
   
   <p>I was in hope that Charley Eldridge would get to publishing, so that we might
      start a magazine, and make it pleasant for the bats and owls and literary
      carrion generally, but he appears to have abandoned the idea, and gone into law
      and claims in Boston.
   </p>

      Good bye. Faithfully
      <br></br>W. D. O'Connor.
