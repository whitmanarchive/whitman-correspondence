   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00612_n8">1. This letter dates to
      January 19, 1869. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to the year 1873.
      But Edwin Haviland Miller dated it to 1869, and Sherry Ceniza dated it to
      1872 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367; <em>Walt Whitman
         and 19th-Century Women Reformers</em> [Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama
      Press, 1998], 242, n. 1). Miller is correct: the letter dates to 1869. The
      source of Bucke's error is unknown, and Ceniza was misled by Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's plan to send a package to daughter Hannah (Whitman) Heyde,
      which seems to echo her 
      letter to Walt Whitman that Ceniza dated incorrectly to 1871 (242, n.
      1).<br><br>
      The year 1869 can be confirmed by the publication of one of Walt Whitman's
      poems and a visit to Brooklyn by Joseph Phineas Davis, which closely matches
      a letter from Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman. Louisa received a copy of the
      February 1869 issue of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, which
      printed Walt Whitman's "Proud Music of the Sea-Storm." Louisa did not note
      the title of the poem, but she did inform Walt that he need not forward a
      copy. Walt acknowledged receiving copies of the February issue of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> on almost the same day (see his  letter to James T. Field).
      Joseph Phineas Davis visited Louisa the previous Sunday, and the possibility
      that Davis would visit Walt in Washington on his return to St. Louis is
      corroborated by Jeff Whitman's  letter to Walt. Davis in March 1870 was working in Lowell,
      Massachusetts (see Louisa's  to
      Walt), and in 1871 Davis was working in Boston, so his plan to return to St.
      Louis corroborates the year 1869. Finally, the letter refers to January 19
      as "to day tuesday," and January 19 fell on Tuesday in the year
      1869.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00612_n1">3. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor (1830–1913), who, with
      Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates
      during the Washington years. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in
      the antislavery and women's rights movements as a contributor to the <em>Liberator</em> and to a women's rights newspaper <em>Una</em>. She had a close personal relationship with Whitman
      and helped to nurse him after his January 1873 stroke. The correspondence
      between Walt and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with
      William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00438_n4">5. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="duk.00612_n13">6. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a French-born landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa
      Whitman (1823–1908), Walt Whitman's sister, in 1852, and they lived in
      Burlington, Vermont. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman often spoke disparagingly of
      Heyde in her letters to Walt. Louisa eventually received a letter from Heyde
      (but not Hannah) in mid-February, which led her to remark to Walt in her  letter: "i felt very glad even to
      hear from him)."<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="duk.00597_n3">7. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward moved from Brooklyn to
      reside with them in Camden in August 1872. For more information on George, see

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">8. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">9. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="duk.00612_n15">11. Joseph Phineas Davis and
      George Washington Whitman may have been discussing the physical plants that
      housed the pump engines for the Water Works or the "dr[iv]ing" or "dr[ain]ing"
      of the pumps themselves. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's phrase is awkward as it
      begins with "davis told george all about" and concludes with "he had with him."
      She likely erred by referring to the communication between Davis and her son
      George both in the sense of a conversation and in the sense of Davis's telling
      George information.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00612_n11">12. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      relayed Davis's hint that he may visit Walt Whitman in Washington on his return
      trip to St. Louis. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman conveyed the same hint in his
       letter to Walt. Walt and
      Davis knew each other because Davis had shared the Pacific Street house with
      Louisa and Jeff Whitman's family. Whether Davis visited Walt in January 1869 is
      not known.<a href="#r12">[back]

   <p id="duk.00612_n2">13. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. Based on the report that Mattie "seems to be gaining" in this
      letter, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had probably received the January 7, 1869
      letter, in which Mattie wrote, "I cough very little and raise scarcly any
      [blood] which I think looks favorable" (see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1977], 64). After residing in Brooklyn in a home that
      she shared with Louisa and Louisa's son Edward, in 1868 Mattie and her daughters
      moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the
      position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that
      led to her death in 1873. For more on Mattie, see Waldron, 1–26.<a href="#r13">[back]

   <p id="duk.00422_n2">14. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r14">[back]
