      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I am greatly
      surprised at the course
      Worthington has taken. He
      is a rascal &amp; should be
      punished. I see no course
      to take but to commence
      proceedings against him
      at once. If you desire it
      I will see a lawyer &amp; have
      the necessary papers drawn
      up. It would be better
      to sue him in Camden
      &amp; bring him there. I dare
      say that if a summary
      
      were served upon him he
      would be brought to his senses
      I don't know whether he could
      be proceeded against criminally.
      Why not ask your friend in
      Camden who defended Hunter,
      I forget his name. Or write
      to Ashton &amp; get his opinion
      on the whole matter. Either
      of them will no doubt gladly
      give you their opinion free.
      If I ask a lawyer here I
      should expect to fee him.
      I will undertake to raise 
      some money to put the
      matter through &amp; will put
      down $50 myself. I think
      I could raise some in
      
      Boston, through J.T. Fields.
      I do not want to go to Worthington
      &amp; ask for an explanation, or
      have any one else go, I want
      to slap a summary upon
      him at once. I can have
      the complaint made out for
      you to swear to &amp; sign, &amp; then
      when he puts in his answer we
      can see what defense he sets
      up. In the meantime while
      suit is pending an injunction
      can be served upon Worthington
      on stopping him from printing 
      &amp; selling the book. That could
      be done in a few days.
      An order would have to be 
      
      obtained of the court
      in N.Y. compelling him to stop
      or show cause why he should
      not be stopped.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Write me explicitly what
      you would have me do &amp; I will
      do it. Don't be afraid of the trouble
      in the cost of legal proceedings,
      your friends will see to that.
      If you do not want to write to
      Ashton or contact a lawyer in
      Camden, then I will do it here.
      
   </p>

      P.S. I saw a lot of those books at Legget
      Brothers Bookstore last summer or spring &amp; I was
      told either there or at Worthington's that
      they were some of the Thayer &amp; Eldridge
      stock bound up. I forgot who told me.
