      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This morning I received from D<u>r</u> Johnston<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r1">1</a></sup> a copy of the current number of "<u>Great Thoughts</u>"
      (containing a short article on yourself) and a note in which he told me of his
      intention to send a copy to <u>you</u>. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In the same paper I found
      copies of two beautiful letters by Carlyle which I have not previously met
      with.—As you may <u>possibly</u> overlook them, and as one
      will be of special interest to you, I will cut it out and enclose it with this.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I have no time now for more, but, with love always, remain</p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours affectionately
      <br></br>J. W. Wallace

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
