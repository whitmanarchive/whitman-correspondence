   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall return on Monday next, in the 12:30 train from Jersey city—(the train I
      usually come in)
   </p>
   
   <p>Pete I have rec'd your letter of 26th—Mother seems
      to-day full as well as usual—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I continue all right—I have been on to New Haven, about 75 miles from
      here—a former friend of mine<sup><a href="#loc.01540_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> is in a dying condition there, from consumption
      &amp; expressed such a strong desire to see me, that I went on—I though he
      would die while I was there—he was all wasted to a skeleton, faculties good,
      but voice only a low
      
      whisper—I returned last night, after midnight
   </p>
   
   <p>—Well bub, my time here is short—I have had a good quiet visit—the best in some respects
      yet—&amp; I feel satisfied
   </p>
   
   <p>—My darling son we will very soon be together again</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
