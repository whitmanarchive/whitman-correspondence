   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07690_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario Canada. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. |
      Aug 14 | 8 PM | 89.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07690_n5">2. Whitman sat for the photographer Frederick Gutekunst in Philadelphia on August 7,
      1889, and 
      requested "specimens" of what he called the "big half-length, sitting, no hat," a
      <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/image110.html?sort=year&amp;order=ascending&amp;page=12">photograph</a> that 
      he and Bucke both admired.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07690_n3">3. In 1889, physiologist Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard (1817–1894) injected himself with
      an elixir of extracts 
      from monkey testicles and reported rejuvenated sexual prowess. His elixir received
      a great deal of publicity and was used by thousands of men.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07690_n4">4. In 1877, the former Union Civil War General Augustus James Pleasonton (1808–1894)
      started a 
      health craze based on his notion that the color blue (like the blue sky) promoted
      growth in animals and plants, and he experimented by growing grapes 
      and raising pigs under blue glass. Many dismissed his claims as quackery, but others
      took the claims seriously, and what Whitman called the "<em>blue 
         glass</em> furore" lasted several years—with blue glass supposedly curing a range of maladies
      from back pain to baldness—before being fully debunked.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07690_n2">5. At this time, Whitman was
      preparing a portfolio of self-portraits. He wanted to publish the portfolio, but
      the project was never completed. Whitman did include several photographs (or
      engravings of them) in the 1889 issue of <em>Leaves of
         Grass.</em><a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">6. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
