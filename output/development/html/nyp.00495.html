   <p>Your good letter rec'd<sup><a href="#nyp.00495_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—welcomed as always—I am out here
      this month with a valued Quaker friend, &amp; enjoying the experience &amp; visit
      much—Ample quiet country, house, large library, garden—the family (they
      too special friends of mine) all away at Newport—my friend down in 
      Phila.
      
       at business bulk of the day—I alone here writing, reading,
      loafing—Then every afternoon a long drive about this beautiful, wonderful,
      never-ending variety of country, the long Wissahickon, roads, Indian Rock, Mt
      Airy, Chestnut Hill—I find I don't need to go to Rocky Mts. or Saguenay for
      natural beauty or grandeur—I am well—nothing very new—
   </p>
