      <br></br><br></br></span><span class="handshift">Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">Thy welcome card came just as we were leaving London
      last week,<sup><a href="#loc.001374_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> after a very sad week with my cousin Saidee, whom thee may remember. She
      has been living for the last year &amp; a half in Berlin, her husband being
      correspondent for the N.Y. Herald, &amp; a few weeks ago the summons came for him to
      go back to New York. So they planned to stop in London for a couple of weeks on
      their way home, do their necessary shopping &amp; say their goodbyes to all of us.
      Frank<sup><a href="#n6114" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; I were in Scotland when we first heard of this
      plan, &amp; we hastened to come down &amp; meet them, full of all kinds of joyful
      anticipations. Saidee &amp; I were most eager to compare, the great rivals, her
      little boy a year &amp; a half old, &amp; Ray her baby girl almost the same age.
      Besides little Charley, Saidee had another baby to show me, a dear little creature
      only a month old. Mother &amp; father lent their house—No. 44—to
      them for their London stay, so that we were close together. When we arrived from
      Scotland, however, we found everything in confusion. The journey had been too much
      for them all: Saidee was ill in bed, both babies were ailing, &amp; the youngest one
      dangerously ill. Mr. Nordhoff, Saidee's husband, had not crossed with her, but was
      travelling in Germany with a changing address, so that he could not be telegraphed
      to, &amp; soon after we came the doctor, contrary to all professional ettiquette
      gave up the baby's case, &amp; they did not know to whom to apply. So all our week
      which we had been looking forward to as a happy reunion, was given over to anxiety
      &amp; telegrams to doctors and nurses who all seemed to be out of town. At the end 
      of the time, on Saturday, the baby died in his mother's arms. The next day Mr.
      Nordhoff arrived &amp; then we came away, as I was quite worn out with the
      responsibility &amp; anxiety. We have been resting here for a week now, &amp; 
       we have news
      that Saidee &amp; the other child are better, &amp; that they expect to sail on the
      same day that this letter begins its voyage to cross to thee.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">I had a welcome letter from Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r3">3</a></sup> giving good news about thy health, &amp; from thy pen this
      morning in the Century are the army reminiscences which we have all enjoyed
      exceedingly. So I do not feel, somehow as if we were all the world apart. I can
      imagine myself tomorrow crossing the Camden ferry &amp; coming to find thee in thy
      den ready to talk as if I had not ever been away at all. I only wish it could come
      true! I wonder if Mr. Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r4">4</a></sup> is with thee now, &amp; whether
      he has got his professorship in the Art Academy. He promised to write &amp; tell me,
      but I have never heard from him.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">We are at work upon our belated philosophy, grinding
      out the first few chapters which we have long had in the shape of scrappy notes. I
      dont know whether I ever told thee our ambitions. We want to write a philosophy in
      terms simple enough for anyone to understand, explaining what Kant has done in the
      investigation of knowledge, &amp; then going on to make use of the same critical
      method to find out what presuppositions lie at the basis of action. So that we hope
      to establish a method of studying ethics on the same secure basis which philosophers
      now have for the examination of knowledge. But it is incredibly hard to open the
      results of close thinking to people who do not care enough to take the trouble to
      think out for themselves, &amp; every time we try our MS. on one of the uninitiated
      we are profoundly discouraged. I am using these days of leisure to mature a scheme
      of education for Ray,<sup><a href="#loc.01354_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; enlarge my list of books for her. I want to begin her on
      the folklore of all the different nations for her fairy tales, &amp; lead her on
      from that to an interest in the history &amp; geography &amp; government of those
      nations. Logan<sup><a href="#loc.01350_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; Frank &amp; I are also reading a
      little Greek together, &amp; our spare time we give to play—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
