      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy &amp; comrade,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I sent off a letter to you yesterday noon, but towards evening Mr. Davis brought me
      
      up from the p. o. yours of the 15th,<sup><a href="#loc.01592_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> which I was so glad to get that you shall 
      have an answer right off. After the flurry of snow I told you of yesterday morning,
      
      we had a pleasant clear afternoon. I took a long walk, partly through the woods, 
      and enjoyed it much. The weather was pretty cold &amp; sharp, &amp; remains so yet. 
      As I left my overcoat in Washington, I have been compelled to get something here—so
      I have bought me a great iron-grey shawl, which I find very acceptable. 
      I always had doubts about a shawl, but have already got used to mine, &amp; like it 
      first rate. In the evening, I went by invitation to a party of ladies &amp; gentlemen—mostly
      ladies. We had a warm, animated talk, among other things about Spiritualism. 
      I talked too, indeed went in like a house afire. It was good exercise—for the fun
      of the thing. 
      I also made love to the women, &amp; flatter myself that I created at least one impression—wretch
      
      &amp; gay deceiver that I am. Then away late—lost my way—wandered over the city, 
      &amp; got home after one o'clock.<sup><a href="#loc.01592_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The truth is, Peter, that I am here at present times mainly in the midst of female
      women, 
      some of them young &amp; jolly—&amp; meet them most every evening in company—&amp; the way in
      
      which this aged party comes up to the scratch &amp; cuts out the youthful parties 
      &amp; fills their hearts with envy is absolutely a caution. You would be astonished, 
      my son, to see the brass &amp; coolness, &amp; the capacity of flirtation &amp; carrying on 
      with the girls—I would never have believed it of myself. Brought here by destiny,
      
      surrounded in this way—&amp; as I in self defence would modestly state—sought for, 
      seized upon &amp; ravingly devoured by these creatures—&amp; <em>so</em> nice &amp; smart some of them are, 
      &amp; handsome too—there is nothing left for me—is there—but to go in. Of course, 
      young man, you understand, it is all on the square. My going in amounts to just talking
      
      &amp; joking &amp; having a devil of a jolly time, carrying on—that's all. They are all 
      as good girls as ever lived. I have already had three or four such parties here—which,
      you will certainly admit, considering my age &amp; heft, to say nothing of 
      my reputation, is doing pretty well.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I go about quite a good deal—this is as handsome a city, as I ever saw. 
      Some of the streets run up steep hills. Except in a few of the business streets, 
      where the buildings are compact—in nine-tenths of the city, every house stands separate,
      
      &amp; has a little or quite a deal of ground about it, for flowers, &amp; for shade or fruit
      trees, 
      or a garden. I never saw such a prosperous looking city—but of course no grand 
      public buildings like Washington.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This forenoon I have been out away down along the banks of the river &amp; cove, 
      &amp; making explorations generally. All is new to me, &amp; I returned quite tired. 
      I have eat a hearty dinner. Then I thought I would come up &amp; sit a while in my room.
      
      But as I did not feel like reading, I concluded to write this precious screed. 
      Fortunate young man, to keep getting such instructive letters—aint you? 
      It is now four o'clock &amp; bright &amp; cool, &amp; I have staid in long enough. 
      I will sally forth, on a walk, &amp; drop this in the P. O. before supper. 
      So long, dear Pete—&amp; my love to you as always, always.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <p id="loc.01592_n1">1. This draft letter is
      endorsed, "10th letter."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01592_n2">2. Doyle's  letter, dated "Oct 14—4,"
      mentioned the death of a cousin and a plot to assassinate the president: "all
      the boys sends their love— | Pete X X."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01592_n3">3. Walt Whitman's directions
      for transposing material are confusing at this point. Possibly in the letter he
      sent he deleted this sentence, which interrupted his gossip about the
      ladies.<a href="#r3">[back]
