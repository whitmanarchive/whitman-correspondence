      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I only write to say that I have received your welcome letter of the 9th, from Jamestown—&amp;
      that—as Mrs. Paulina Davis has been here, &amp; has, in her own &amp; husband's behalf, 
      kindly invited me, &amp; indeed made the arrangements—I shall come on to Providence, 
      to-morrow, 15th—they to meet me at the depot, &amp; take me home as their guest—from whence
      I shall report to you, &amp; to Dr. &amp; Mrs. Channing forthwith—&amp; fulfil my promised visit
      to them also, before I return here—which will be about 21st or 22d.
      
   </p>

      Affectionately
      <br></br>Walt.
