      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Many tokens have you sent me.<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r1">1</a></sup> I love the "riddle song"<sup><a href="#med.00636_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; ponder it over &amp;
      over, Am at once
      tantalized &amp; pleased. If it were not for the "two little breaths of words" I
      should be content with a vague yet none the less real answering thought—but
      those words set me seeking something more definite.
      William Rossetti<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r3">3</a></sup> and I were talking of it. He &amp; his wife &amp; all his children
      including the last comer—as pretty &amp; sweet tempered a baby as ever
      I saw—all came up &amp; dined with us a Sunday or two ago—&amp; then we
      sauntered away the afternoon on our pleasant  heath—Rossetti stretching
      himself onto grass with his pipe (he says he has a good [
      <span class="unclear">spice?</span>]
       of
      Italian laziness in him, though practically the most industrious of men. The
      children scampering about, the baby placidly enjoying. Often dear Friend do I
      picture you sitting on one of the benches (may my dream come true!) enjoying the
      fresh breeze that almost always blows there, watching the throngs of Londoners of
      all
      degrees but chiefly the poor &amp; the hardworking, who come up to breathe it on
      Saturday &amp; Sunday afternoons—or musing there quiet &amp; alone as one may do other
      days, with green &amp; fertile Middlesex &amp; Hertfordshire spread out at 
      
      ones
      
      
      
       feet
      &amp; a few blue hills beyond. Your post card received yesterday contained welcome
      news indeed. Putting together that &amp; the paper that came a day or two before, I
      infer that you are not only going to Dr. Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> but are travelling with him. (And
      by the bye I feel very grateful to him for that letter to the paper, for putting an
      extinguisher on those smouldering lies.) So I know you have a good 
      
      friends
      
      
      
       arm to
      lean on when you want it, and are going to have a very jolly time indeed—a
      great time, wandering over the great and splendid land. Next year it must be little
      England—the mighty mother. Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r5">5</a></sup> is working very hard at the Academy just
      now—the advantage being unlimited models—incessant nature (a too
      costly business in one's own studio) and also sometimes valuable hints from our best
      painters. He leaves here before 9 a.m &amp; does not get back 
      till
      
       near 9 p.m. Bee<sup><a href="#n0260" id="r6">6</a></sup> is at Edinburgh helping one of our best woman doctors who
      is bent on persuading her to reconsider her decision &amp; not be so diffident of
      her own powers. How it will end I cannot say. Giddy<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r7">7</a></sup> sings a good deal, I think her
      voice is developing with a really sweet full toned contralto. I still busy with the
      proof &amp;c. of the new edition of my 
      
      Husbands
      
      
      
       book.<sup><a href="#loc.04050_n1" id="r8">8</a></sup> There cannot be finer work of its
      kind than the Scribner woodcuts from 
      
      Blakes
      
      
      
       designs of which they have lent us the
      blocks It is delightful to have this help &amp; enrichment of the book from
      America.—We are having a dripping June but it is what the crops want. We
      shall get into our new house which stands in a pleasant nook looking out on gardens
      back &amp; front &amp; close to the heath the end of August or beginning of
      September. We often talk of the Staffords who have sent Herby many affectionate
      words &amp; tokens. Your friends here are increasing in number &amp; the old ones are very staunch:
      indeed dearest friend your Poems have found in places here &amp; specially in the
      north, the soil that suits them.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You will like to see this letter of Carpenter's.<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r9">9</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Love from us all.</p>
   
   
   <p>Please give a friendly greeting to Dr &amp; Mrs Bucke. Who
      should come to see us a week or two ago but Mr.
      Bary.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0259">1. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

      in the Tarrytown <em>Sunnyside Press</em> on April 3.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">3. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">5. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0260">6. Beatrice Carwardine Gilchrist (1854–1881) was
      the second child (and first daughter) of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist. An
      aspiring physician, Beatrice took the needed preparatory classes but was barred
      (as were all women) from becoming a medical student in England. As a result, she
      attended the Women's Medical College in Philadelphia. She held positions as a
      physician in Berne, Switzerland, and later Edinburgh before committing suicide
      by fatally ingesting hydrocyanic acid in 1881.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n0890">7. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="n0141b">9. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r9">[back]
