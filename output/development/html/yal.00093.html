      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>My idea is a book of the time, worthy the time—something considerably beyond mere
      hospital sketches—a book for sale perhaps in a larger American market—the premises
      or skeleton memoranda of incidents, persons, places, sights, the past year (mostly
      jotted down either on the spot or in the spirit of seeing or hearing what is narrated)<sup><a href="#yal.00093_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—(I left New York early last December, &amp; have been around in the front<sup><a href="#yal.00093_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> or here ever since)—full of interest I surely think—in some respects somewhat a combination
      in handling of the Old French Memoires, &amp; my own personality (things seen through
      my eyes, &amp; what my vision brings)—a book full enough of mosaic, but all fused to one
      comprehensive thing—one of the drifts is to push forward the very big &amp; needed truth,
      that our national military system needs shifting, revolutionizing &amp; made to tally
      with democracy, the people<sup><a href="#yal.00093_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>—The officers should almost invariably rise from the ranks—there is an absolute want
      of democratic spirit in the present system &amp; officers—it is the feudal spirit exclusively—nearly
      the entire capacity, keenness &amp; courage of our army are in the ranks—(what has been
      done has been unavoidable so far, but the time has arrived to discuss the change)—
   </p>    
   
   <p>I have much to say of the hospitals, the immense national hospitals—in them too most
      radical changes of premises are demanded—(the air, the spirit of a thing is every
      thing, the details follow &amp; adjust themselves). I have many hospital incidents, [that]
      will take with the general reader—I ventilate my general democracy with details very
      largely &amp; with reference to the future—bringing in persons, the President, Seward<sup><a href="#yal.00093_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>, Congress, the Capitol, Washington City, many of the actors of the drama—have something
      to say of the great trunk America, the West &amp;c &amp;c—do not hesitate to diffuse <em>myself</em>—the book is very rapid—is a book that can be read by the five or ten minutes at (being
      full of small parts, pieces, paragraphs with their dates, incidents &amp;c)—I should think
      two or three thousand sale ought to be certainly depended on here in hospitals in
      Washington, among departments &amp;c—
   </p>
   
   <p>My idea is a book of handy size &amp; form, 16 mo or smallish 12 mo, <em>first rate paper</em> (this last indispensable), ordinary binding, strongly stitched, to cost including
      copyright not more than 35 or 40cts or there-abouts to make, to retail for a dollar. It should be got out <em>immediately</em>. I think an edition, elegantly bound, might be pushed off for books for presents
      &amp;c for the holidays, if advertised for that purpose. It would be very appropriate.
      I think it a book that would please women. I should expect it to be popular with the
      trade.
   </p>
   
   <p>Of course I propose the affair to you publisherially as something to invest in, to
      make out of (for both of us)—I take it it would be a very handsome speculation. Only
      it is to be done while the thing is warm, namely <em>at once</em>. I have been &amp; am in the midst of these things, I feel myself full of them, &amp; I know
      the people generally now are too (far more than they know,) &amp; would readily absorb
      &amp; understand my mem[oranda]. Wherefore let us make &amp; publish the book, &amp; out with
      it so as to have it for sale by middle or 20th of November.<sup><a href="#yal.00093_n100" id="r5">5</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Redpath (1833–1891),
      an antislavery activist, journalist, and longtime friend of Whitman, was the
      author of <em>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown</em> (Boston:
      Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the <em>New York
         Tribune</em> during the war, and the originator of the "Lyceum" lectures. He
      met Whitman in Boston in 1860 and remained an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 9
      vols., 3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp." Redpath became
      editor of <em>The North American Review</em> in November 1886. See
      also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins, 1926);

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00093_n2">1. Whitman probably chose
      Redpath as the publisher of his proposed book because earlier in the year he had
      printed Louisa May Alcott's <em>Hospital Sketches</em>, which
      relates the experiences of Tribulation Periwinkle in a military hospital in
      Georgetown. (Periwinkle, actually the author, had expected to go to Armory
      Square Hospital, but at the last minute was sent to "Hurly-burly House.") In his
      reply on , Redpath said that there
      was "a lion in the way—$. I could easily publish a small Book, but the one
      you propose...implies an expenditure that may be beyond my means." Whitman's
      proposal was not to be realized until the publication of <em>Memoranda During the War</em>. Accompanying Whitman's draft letter is his
      sketch of the title page. An editor fully sympathizes with Traubel's remark
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953], 4:416) when he received
      this letter from Whitman: "It made me sweat to look at it." It is a maze of
      interlineations.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00093_n3">2. Once again Whitman
      overstated his involvement in the war.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00093_n4">3. In his "Notebook:
      September–October, 1863," Whitman made this entry on September 23: "Talk
      with Ben in Ward A about tyrannous and unnecessary exposure of the soldiers—how
      many officers there are who dare not go into engagements nor even out on picket
      with their men, for fear of their lives from their own men—the 8th N Y Cav Col
      Davis, (killed afterward) who . . . made the poor sick men (sick with diarrhea)
      dismount &amp; mount 13 times to make them do it in military style—I have seen
      not a single officer that seemed to know American men" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00093_n5">4. William Henry Seward
      (1801–1872) was secretary of state from 1861 to 1869 under Presidents
      Lincoln and Johnson.<a href="#r4">[back]
