   <p>Good kind friend—Your letter, enclosing $2—most gratefully received. I
      assure you. How you help us along—How could we ever survive, but for your
      goodness—

   <p>Han<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r1">1</a></sup> is but poorly as yet. A

       day overhead, and an adventurous robin chirping at 4 O:Clock this
      morning—I heard him from my window—but cold chilly, freezing nights
      prevail—I am quite unsteady on my legs, from effects of the
      grippe—and
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>my stomach is weak, but I feel stronger this morning and encouraged—</p>
   
   
   <p>God bless you Walt, he has qualified you all through your life, with a benevolent
      disposity, and a sustaining philosophy—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Han talks of you nearly all the time—she can now promenade on the back piazza
      where you may remember the sun used to fall so benignly——
