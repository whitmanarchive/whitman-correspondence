   <p>Our hearts out here are with you more than you probably think at this gloomy time.<sup><a href="#mhs.00023_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I
      hope &amp; trust you both bear up under it, &amp; that the "God help us" of your
      telegraphic message will be fulfilled—I find myself better than toward the
      conclusion of former summers—am still living here at 328 Mickle st—&amp;
      comfortable.
   </p>
   <p>—I am anxious to hear whether Lou got there all right—am
      sitting here down stairs by the open window as I write—warm here for two
      days.
