      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter of March 28—you must have had rather a dreary time this winter,
      the cold &amp; storms, 
      &amp; being left so much alone<sup><a href="#nyp.00262_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—but now I think the spring is upon us, 
      &amp; I think it will be pleasant enough there all summer—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear mother, I have not much to write this time—I am feeling very well—no trouble
      in the head, nor any thing, so far—I get along very well in my boarding house—the
      landlady<sup><a href="#nyp.00262_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> is a young woman, from New York State—but she works in the Treasury 
      &amp; leaves things to her servants, black women—I like her very well—&amp; the place is probably
      as good a one as I could get—In the Office every thing is just the same—Ashton expects
      to leave next May or June.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have had very pleasant weather here this week—only sometimes the dust is bad—I
      went to the Hospital Sunday &amp; shall go again this afternoon—Kephart<sup><a href="#nyp.00262_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>, that had bleeding at the lungs, 
      &amp; pneumonia, is quite recovered—when I came away, he walked out a few blocks with
      me—there are one or two pretty bad cases that I go to see, yet—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Washington is filled with <em>darkies</em>—the men &amp; children &amp; wenches swarm in all directions—(I am not sure but the North
      is like the man that won the elephant in a raffle)—I was glad you wrote about the
      little girls—Tell Hattie and sis Uncle Walt sends his love to them, 
      &amp; is coming home to see them.
      
   </p>
