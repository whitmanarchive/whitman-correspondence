   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="syr.00048_n1">1. Horace Traubel's note,
      "see | notes | April 3 | 1889," appears in the upper left-hand corner of the
      recto. The reference is to Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.73.html">Wednesday, April 3, 1889</a>.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="syr.00048_n2">2. On , Whitman wrote Bucke: "A long &amp;
      good letter f'm Stedman &amp; a present of the big vols: (all yet printed, 7) of
      his 'American Literature' in wh' I appear (with good wood-engraving
      portrait)—" (see also Whitman's letter to Edmund Clarence Stedman of ). Whitman receives more space,
      twelve-and-a-half pages, plus a full-page portrait, in Vol. II of Stedman's <em>A Library of American Literature: From the Earliest Settlement
         to the Present Time</em>, co-edited with Ellen Mackay Hutchinson, 2nd ed.
      (New York: William Evartz Benjamin, 1894) than any other poet.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n1043">3. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
