   </p>
   
   <p>I have your card of last Wednesday I feel pretty concerned at your condition and wish
      more than ever that you had got up here last spring—we had such a cool summer
      here that unquestionably you would have been better here than in Camden. I am very
      anxious to see you and will do so as soon as I can get away from here—I think
      I told you I had four months [
      <span class="unclear">holidays?</span>]
       beginning 15<u>th</u> of the present month.
      Shortly after the
      15<u>th</u> I hope to see you and then we shall see what can
      be done. Meantime please write to me as often as you can telling me how you
      keep.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
