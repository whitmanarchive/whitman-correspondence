      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy Van<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.04259_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>So you are back again—I heard that your folks had sent for you—How did
      you like New York &amp; your trip &amp; every thing? I got your letter &amp; was
      glad to get it—write to me again if you feel like it—I saw Bill Engle
      &amp; he told me they had sent for you, &amp; that Ed was up here in Camden in a
      store—(I have not seen Ed yet)—Van I send you a paper—read that
      story "the boy from Xenia"—it is very good—in fact there is lots of good
      reading in the little paper—I know you do not care much for reading, but I
      wish you would read more—read this paper I send any how
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I have had a good deal of trouble in business lately, but I guess it is going to be
      all right—I am not altogether out of the woods, but near it surely—I
      keep about as usual in health—I got a paper from Herbert—one of his
      pictures has taken a big prize, a gold medal—(probably he has wrote your folks
      all about it though)—A big fire up here last night, the Narrow Gauge Engine
      House &amp; Depot, five engines burnt, bad luck—
   </p>
   
   <p>—Van, show this letter to your father and mother—my love to you, boy, &amp; to
      all the rest, every one—I want to come down before long—Ruth, have you
      got <u>a chicken</u> ready? I will send you word—I 
      dream'd
      
       night before last I was
      down by the old pond a long while—the old tulip tree was 
      coverd
      
       with blossoms
      &amp; the bees humming—
   </p>

   <p id="loc.04259_n1">1. Van Doran Stafford wrote
      to Whitman on  from New York, where he was
      employed on the steamer "Plymouth Rock." He was enjoying New York and was not
