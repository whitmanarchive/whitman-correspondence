      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir,
      <br></br>Dear Poet, Friend, and Master,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>To celebrate your seventieth birthday, I your grateful and devoted admirer, have
      written some words of sympathy and congratulation, and published them in the issue
      of June 2nd of the paper I am editing just now, viz. the 'Deutsche Presse,' the
      official organ of the league of German authors (Deutschen Schriftsteller-Verband).<sup><a href="#med.00877_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> I
      trust I may be able some day to devote to you and your work a serious essay
      better suited to do justice to your genius than was possible in that aphoristic
      article. However, those few lines will at least serve as an unambiguous testimony
      of
      my deep and true devotion to you, and as it may give you pleasure to hear of an
      unknown German friend of yours, I take the liberty to send you that birthday paper,
      hoping you will look upon it in kind and indulgent eyes.<sup><a href="#med.00877_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Ever yours sincerely and affectionately
      <br></br>Edward Bertz

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Bertz
      (1853–1931), also spelled "Eduard," was a German writer and translator
      from Potsdam, who became involved with social democracy movements and signed a
      petition against the criminalization of homosexuality in Germany. For more
      information on Bertz, see Grünzweig, Walter, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_176.html">Bertz, Eduard (1853–1931)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00877_n3">1. Bertz published an article
      in the <em>Deutsche Presse</em> of June 2, 1889 (Amelia von Ende,
      "Whitman and the Germans of Today," <em>The Conservator</em> No. 4
      [June 1907], 55–57). A holograph copy of the article, with corrections by
      Whitman (June 1889) is part of the Charles E. Feinberg Collection, held by the
      Library of Congress.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00877_n1">2. Whitman discussed the letter
      and Bertz's article with Horace Traubel, remarking, "It is interesting to me to
      know what they think of us way over there. It comes from Berlin, which is a
      center, I suppose, an important center" (Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.82.html">Friday, June 28, 1889</a>).<a href="#r2">[back]
