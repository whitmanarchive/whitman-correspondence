      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I wrote you several days ago asking you to tell me whether $100 was
      your lowest price. I think I said also that if you charged lower than that price I
      could sell a great many more articles for you than I could at these rates. I enclose
      a check for $60, which is payment for the article according to your own estimate of
      3,000 words, at the rate of $20 a thousand, which is the very highest rate they
      pay.<sup><a href="#loc.03287_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I had to decide within ten minutes whether I
      would accept it or not, as Mr. Ferris, who is in 
      charce
      
       of the syndicate, was just about to start for Mount McGregor. I told him,
      however, that if you refused to sell the article for less I should  consider myself
      responsible for the balance and expect payment for it either from him or from Mr.
      Rice.<sup><a href="#n6004" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p> So my dear old friend I have protected your interests to the best of my judgement
      and
      if you want me to follow orders and break owners in future let me know and I
      will do it. The great problem that the universe is asking you this moment is whether
      I am to regard this check as payment in full or payment on account. I also would 
      like you to answer my letters. I have no interest whatever in the syndicate to which
      I sold the manuscript. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Redpath (1833–1891),
      an antislavery activist, journalist, and longtime friend of Whitman, was the
      author of <em>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown</em> (Boston:
      Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the <em>New York
         Tribune</em> during the war, and the originator of the "Lyceum" lectures. He
      met Whitman in Boston in 1860 and remained an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 9
      vols., 3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp." Redpath became
      editor of <em>The North American Review</em> in November 1886. See
      also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins, 1926);

         Making of Nineteenth-Century America</em> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University
      Press, 2008); and J.R. LeMaster, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_46.html">Redpath, James [1833–1891]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03287_n1">1. Redpath is discussing
      Whitman's "Booth and the Old Bowery." Whitman eventually accepted $60 for it,
      and it was published in Allen Thorndike Rice's New York <em>Tribune</em> on August 16, 1885. See also Whitman's reply to Redpath of
