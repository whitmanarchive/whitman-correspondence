   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02919_n2">1. Kennedy has written this
      letter on a United States Letter Sheet Envelope. This letter is addressed: Walt
      Whitman | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked: Belmont | Apr | 11 | Mass; [illegible] | 1887 | Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="pri.00009_n1">2. Ernest Rhys
      (1859–1946) wrote on : "Let me
      say simply in a young man's way to you who are an old man now, how dearly and
      earnestly I think of you across the sea to-night, remembering the Past, looking
      on to the great to-morrow, for perhaps of all young men you have helped me most
      powerfully &amp; perfectly." On  Rhys
      proposed a one-shilling edition of Whitman's poetry in <em>The
         Canterbury Poets</em> series. On  Rhys wrote for the third time after waiting "for a reply
      so far in vain," and included the payment from Walter Scott, the English
      publisher of <em>The Canterbury Poets</em>. On Rhys's letter
      Whitman wrote: "the little English selection from L. of G. is out since, &amp;
      the whole edition (10,000) sold." For more information about Rhys, see Joel
      Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.02919_n3">4. Kennedy worked incessantly
      on his "book" and frequently alerted Whitman that it was about to come out, but
      his two books on Whitman did not appear until years after the poet's
