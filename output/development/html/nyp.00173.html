      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just returned home last eve[ning] from Washington, being there to see about
      getting the body of my son Capt. <em>Michael Mullery</em> of Co. I, 7th Regt N.J. Vols. who was killed while leading his men in a desperate
      charge before Petersburgh, Va., June 16th. I took a friend with me from Jersey City
      (T.C. Brown Esq.) but could only get a pass for one, so Mr. Brown has gone to City
      point to get the Body. he took the boat for city point last Wednesday at 3 oclock
      and is now I hope on his way back with the body.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your friend Jesse came home from Washington June 23rd on a 30 days furlough, and the
      same eve[ning] recd the sad intelligence of the death of our son Michael, when Jesse
      came home he was so reduced and weak that I thought he could not live a week, but
      he gained fast after a week or two, and returned back the 25th of July to Davids Island,
      (where he was transferred to from Washington) and from there he got transferred to
      Newark, and got another furlough on the 3rd of August, for 30 days and came home,
      and improved very fast, he returned Sept 5th, and is there yet at Ward U S. Genl.
      Hospital Center St. I took Breakfast with him yesterday morning. he look well and
      is fleshy, but not fit for the front. I will write to him to day and send him your
      letter, and he will call and see you at his earlyest conveniance, he spoke very highly of you when he came home and had your "carte de viste"—and
      took it back with [him] to Newark, he is now assistant cook in the Hospital. he belongs
      in the 7th Ward.
   </p>
   
   <p>His Brother James is still at the front with Sheridan he is well and so far unhurt.
      Thank God, he has never been home since he went in the service, if he lives, we look
      for him next August when I must write to him, and let him know about the invitation
