      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just received your letter, &amp; respond immediately, because by what you have
      written, it may be that you can do me a great favor—I have obtained leave of absence,
      &amp; am coming to New York, principally to bring out a new &amp; much better edition of Leaves
      of Grass complete—that <em>unkillable</em> work!—Mother's apartments in Pacific st are very limited, &amp; I had decided to get
      a lodging room in N. Y. or Brooklyn, so as not to incommode my folks at home—taking
      my meals at the restaurants, &amp; home &amp;c—leaving my time free for my work &amp;c—Now <em>have you such a room for me</em>, at a fair price? I hope you have, for that would be very agreeable—Your going off
      for a week or two would not make any difference—as a lodging is my main object—write
      <em>immediately</em> &amp; let me know, as my leave of absence will probably date from Monday next, 6th inst—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mrs. O'Connor<sup><a href="#pml.00015_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> has gone west, with her mother, for the summer—Wm O'Connor<sup><a href="#pml.00015_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> is well—We all speak of you—The weather is almost perfect here now-a-days—I am writing
      this by my window in the south front of the Treasury building, looking down the beautiful
      grounds in front, and across &amp; down the Potomac for miles, &amp; across to the green hills
      all along Arlington Heights, very beautiful &amp; cool—a view of great expanse, &amp; very
      comforting every way—also a pleasant breeze coming in steadily from the river.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have an agreeable situation here—labor moderate—&amp; plenty of leisure—My principal
      work is to make (from rough drafts) the letters, answers, law opinions, &amp;c that go
      from the Attorney General to the President, or to the Secretary of State, &amp; the other
      Heads of Departments—The rule is that none but such officers as just named have a
      right to require information from Attorney Generals—So you see I have to do only with
      the big men—
   </p>
   
   <p>There is one regular Soldiers Hospital left here, in K street—I go there once or twice
      every week—it is still a great privilege to go—You would be amazed, as well as distressed,
      to know how many old wounds are lingering along yet—youth &amp; hope struggling against
      fate—but the latter, alas! almost always conquering at last—it is indeed a great privilege
      to soothe the lingering days &amp; months of many of these cases.

   <p>Mother is quite well, &amp; comfortable—considering her age—brothers, sisters &amp; the children,
      all well, at last accounts.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Abby H. Price
      (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
      husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
      children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
      age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
      were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
      Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for
      the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother in <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 (1908): 163–169. In a letter to Ellen M.
      O'Connor from , Whitman declared
      with emphasis, "<em>they are all friends</em>, to prize and love
      deeply."

   <p id="pml.00015_n100">1. The envelope for this
      letter bears the address: Mrs. Abby H. Price, | 279 East 55th street, | New York
      City. It is postmarked: Washington D. C. | Aug | 4.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="pml.00015_n3">2. For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen "Nelly" M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and
      later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
      Washington years. Ellen O'Connor had a close personal relationship with Whitman.
      In 1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with William over the Fifteenth
      Amendment, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended
      Whitman's opinion, and in response William established a separate residence. The
      correspondence between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's
      correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="pml.00015_n4">3. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an
      abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. He had been an
      assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> before he
      went to Washington. O'Connor was an intelligent man who deserved something
      better than the various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his
      death. The humdrum of clerkship, however, was relieved by the presence of
      Whitman whom he was to love and venerate—and defend with a single-minded
      fanaticism and an outpouring of vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been
      equaled, most notably in his pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first,
      and in many ways the most important, of the adulators who divided people
      arbitrarily into two categories: those who were for and those who were against
      Walt Whitman. The poet praised O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous
      collection of his tales: "He was a born sample here in the 19th century of the
      flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his
      memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton,
      1910] pp. 513).<a href="#r3">[back]
