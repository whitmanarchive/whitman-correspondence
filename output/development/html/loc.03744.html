      <br></br>My Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter did not reach me: till tonight, when I was getting ready to go to New
      York:  else I 
      wd
      
       have hastened to your "Den" &amp; drank to our noble
      selves in the promised <u>sour mash</u>.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been a little-worried lately over things in general &amp; in some sense, at
      beginning life over again, else I 
      wd
      
       not have jumped so quick at your ill-treatment of me.<sup><a href="#loc.03744_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>God knows &amp; Walt <u>knows</u> that I am as 
      <u>slow</u> as the wrath of God—to take offense especially at
      what my <u>friends
         do</u> or say. Life in the main, has taught me as Bailey<sup><a href="#loc.03744_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> says
   </p>
   "That all religion can inspire is—Hope—: 
   <br>And all mortality can teach is—Bear"!
   
   <p>(2) To start <u>right</u> again I think you had better send me my
      MSS—and let me do as I d—m please with it . . I will send it to the
      World
   </p>
   
   <p>Will see you as soon as I get back from N.Y. . .</p>
   
   <p>Remember that the friend most solicitous of your welfare at the "Scovel House" has
      always been the undersigned—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Matlock Scovel began to
      practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War he was in the New Jersey
      legislature, and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned actively for Horace
      Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S. Treasury during Chester
      Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home
      for Sunday breakfast, as he did on December 2 and 9, 1877 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a description of
      these breakfasts, see <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed.
      William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel,
      see George R. Prowell's <em>The History of Camden County, New
         Jersey</em> (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03744_n1">1. Scovel was apparently
      annoyed by the lack of enthusiasm that Whitman showed for his upcoming essay on
      the poet. After numerous delays and frequent pleas to Whitman to supply material
      for the essay, "Walt Whitman" finally appeared in the <em>Springfield Republican</em> on June 16, 1885. See also Scovel's letter to
      Whitman of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03744_n2">2. Philip James Bailey
      (1816–1902) was an English poet and well-known for his book of verse
      titled <em>Festus</em> (1839), from which Scovel is quoting
      here.<a href="#r2">[back]
