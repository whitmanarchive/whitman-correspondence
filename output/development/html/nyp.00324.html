      <br></br><br></br>Dear Nelly,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter came with the sad news of good Mr. Dille's<sup><a href="#nyp.00324_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> death—I had seen it in the paper—I have thought much of it, 
      through the interesting account you gave—Indeed death has been much in my quiet thoughts
      &amp; musings now for many months.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nelly, there is nothing very new to write you—I have not been so well the past week—but
      feel better this evening. I still have spells of great distress in the head—though
      they pass over—Walking no better—but 
      <em>general strength</em> seems to steadily though very slowly improve—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am writing some war memoranda in the <em>Weekly N. Y. Graphic</em> first number just out—ask Charley to get it for you—In my next—anent of Bull Run—I
      mention Mrs. Johnson<sup><a href="#nyp.00324_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; her sister, (though not by name)—will be out next Thursday—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nelly, I am scratching this off at the Mercantile Library in 10th st. Philadelphia
      (though I date 
      home in Camden) &amp; will have to close to get it in the box in time for the carrier.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Love to you, dear, dear Nelly—
      <br></br>Walt.
