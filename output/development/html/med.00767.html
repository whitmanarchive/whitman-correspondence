   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Gentry
      (1843–1905) was an ornithologist from Philadelphia and had already
      published six books by the time he got into contact with Whitman. It appears
      that his turn to Whitman coincided with a growing alienation from his
      profession. For more on Gentry, see Ed Folsom, "The Mystical Ornithologist and
      the Iowa Tufthunter: Two Unpublished Whitman Letters and Some Identifications,"
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 1:1 (1983),
      18–29.
