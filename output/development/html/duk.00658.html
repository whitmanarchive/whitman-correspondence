      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. McGuire,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The money you gave me for Mr. Tasistro has been handed by me to him, and has substantially
      helped him.<sup><a href="#duk.00658_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> I have been out to see him several times since I met you—he is up &amp; about &amp; in much
      better spirits—has great thoughts of getting well, &amp; going to work to earn his living
      himself.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>He has had a very hard time during the winter—Can never again be strong &amp; well—but
      has indomitable vitality.
   </p>

      Louis Fitzgerald Tasistro (1808–1875?) came to the United States from
      Ireland as a young man. He edited a newspaper in New York and later had a
      brief career on the stage. Subsequently he was a translator for the State
      Department and a lecturer. He was the author of <em>Travels in
         the Southern States: Random Shots and Southern Breezes</em> (1842) and
      translator of Compte de Paris' <em>History of the Civil War in
         America</em> (1875). On April 26, 1872, Walt Whitman inserted in the
      Washington <em>Daily Morning Chronicle</em> an appeal for
      "pecuniary assistance for a man of genius," who was not named. On the
      following day the <em>Chronicle</em> noted "prompt
      contributions" from, among others, Samuel Ward. According to Whitman's  letter to Ward, Tasistro acted
      as the carrier of Ward's money to Whitman.<br><br>
      In the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., there are three
      receipts written by Whitman and signed by Tasistro. On April 26, 1872,
      Tasistro acknowledged $70. On April 29, 1872, he accepted an additional $25,
      and on May 14, 1872, $10. On August 3, 1872, in his own hand, Tasistro
      signed a receipt for $17. On the verso Walt Whitman noted the total of $122:
      "also $10 more handed by W. W. to Mr. Tasistro." On October 24, 1872, Walt
      Whitman wrote: "also about $25 more in different sums since." See Edwin
      Haviland Miller, "Walt Whitman and Louis Fitzgerald Tasistro," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em>, 7 (March 1961),
