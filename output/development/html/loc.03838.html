   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03838_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Pearsall Smith | 40 Grosvenor Road | the Embankment | London s w | England. It
      is postmarked: Camden, N. J. | SEP 12 | 430 PM | 87; London S W | (?) | SP 23 |
      87; (?) | (?) | SP 23 37| AB; New York | SEP 12 (?). Whitman's address is
      printed as follows in the lower left corner of the envelope: Walt Whitman, |
      Camden, | New Jersey, | U.S. America.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0615">2. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0862">3. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03838_n2">4. On August 27 Whitman gave
      Sydney Morse $70 "to pay to caster for the 10 heads." Morse brought four of
      the heads on September 2, one of which was sent to Richard Maurice Bucke
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book; Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). According
      to the tabulation in Whitman's Commonplace Book, the poet paid Morse $133 in
      the next few months, presumably for expenses incurred in casting.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03310_n1">5. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03838_n5">6. Morse created small Whitman
      medallions and made a small bust of Ralph Waldo Emerson; he gave copies to
      Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="loc.03838_n4">7. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945), daughter of Hannah Whitall and Robert Pearsall Smith, was a
      political activist, art historian, and critic, whom Whitman once called his
      "staunchest living woman friend." For more information about Costelloe, see
      Christina Davey, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945),"</a>

   <p id="n6114">8. Benjamin Francis Conn Costelloe
      (1854–1899), Mary's first husband, was an English barrister and Liberal
      Party politician.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">9. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="n0262">10. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
