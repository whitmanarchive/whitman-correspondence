   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n3039">3. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.07601_n2">4. Richard Hinton's
      three-column article "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00640.html">Walt Whitman at Home</a>" appeared in the New York <em>World</em> on April 14, 1889. Whitman observed to Traubel: "It seems like
      three crowded columns of gush. . . . It may seem ungracious . . . to say so (for
      Dick is my friend and means me well) but his piece impresses me most by its
      emptiness—impresses me as a big tumor or boil, much swelled, inflamed,
      bulging, but nothing after all" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.10.html">Wednesday, April 17, 1889</a>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.11.html">Thursday, April 18, 1889</a>). C. Sadakichi Hartmann's article "Walt
      Whitman. Notes of a Conversation with the Good Gray Poet by a German Poet and
      Traveller" appeared in the New York <em>Herald</em> on April 14.
      For Whitman's reactions, see his  letter
      to Bucke and his  letter to William Sloane
      Kennedy (see also Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.9.html">Tuesday, April 16, 1889</a>, and <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.10.html">Wednesday, April 17, 1889</a>). Bucke prepared a correction for the <em>Herald</em> which was not printed (Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.29.html">Monday, May 6, 1889</a>).<a href="#r4">[back]
