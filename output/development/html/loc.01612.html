   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>."
