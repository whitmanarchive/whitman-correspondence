   <p>Quite sharp &amp; cold this forenoon, &amp; I am sitting by a good oak
      fire—Am still imprison'd in the sick room—Keep up spirits pretty fair,
      but weak as ever in my movements, &amp; being kept indoor for most nine months
      begins to tell on me—I almost wonder I keep as well as I do—but I have
      been pretty low—the doctors—even Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup>—gave me quite up more than once—They just kept life like a little
      light prevented from being all put out (&amp; this was the reason why I often had to
      deny friends from seeing me)—&amp; for a month or so I was in a horrible
      plight—a nuisance to myself &amp; all—but my nurse (Ed Wilkins,<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r3">3</a></sup> the Canadian young man Dr. B. sent) stuck to me &amp; it has
      sort o' pass'd over—or at any rate the worst or it—At present I sit here in the room—Mrs
      Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r4">4</a></sup> has
      just been in &amp; wishes to send her love to you, &amp; says come up &amp; see
      us—my mentality ab't the same as ever (tho' I get very soon sore &amp; tired
      reading, or being talked to)—&amp; not much show of being any
      better—thankful that things are as well as they are with me—for they
      might be much worse—
   </p>        
   
   
   <p>Susan, your good letter came this forenoon &amp; I was glad enough to hear
      from you all—I thank you so much for it I write all this rigmarole at
      once—Herbert<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r5">5</a></sup> paid me quite a visit last evn'g—I
      fancy he is doing well, &amp; quite a fellow over there among the artists—I
      hear from Edw'd Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r6">6</a></sup>—he always wishes to be
      remembered to you all, specially Ed<sup><a href="#n0589c" id="r7">7</a></sup>—he seems to be well
      &amp; doing well.—

      at Blackwood—(I yesterday paid the
      three months board bill $45.50 there) he is well, &amp; seems to be well off &amp;
      satisfied—young Harry Bonsall<sup><a href="#loc.03874_n2" id="r9">9</a></sup> died there three or four weeks ago—my sisters

      without fail the first chance you get—it is written largely to him—I

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n4319">3. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert

   <p id="n0141b">6. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="n0699">8. Edward Whitman (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or
      "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. He required lifelong
      assistance for significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in
      the care of his mother until her death. His brother George Washington Whitman
      cared for him for most of the rest of his life, with financial support from Walt
      Whitman. For more information on Eddy, see Randall Waldron, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_221.html">Whitman, Edward (1835–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      married Ansel Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they lived in Greenport,
      Long Island. Mary and Ansel had five children: George, Minnie, Fanny, Louisa,

   <p id="n0700">12. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n0696">13. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (d. 1892), called "Loo" or
      "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their son,
      Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second son
      was stillborn. For more on Louisa, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n4310">14. Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford (b.
      1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked by
      early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
