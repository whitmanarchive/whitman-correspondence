      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing new or particular<sup><a href="#duk.00664_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I send you an "Appleton's
      Journal," with some good reading in it<sup><a href="#duk.00664_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Well, mother, how
      are you all? Last night was a heavy rain here—I thought of your roof—the snow
      has all disappeared here—very pleasant yesterday indeed here—to-day the whole
      city looks all washed clean—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I went to a concert Tuesday night—very good—I heard a singer, Mario<sup><a href="#n0381" id="r4">4</a></sup>, I heard 30 years ago—an old man, now—yet he sings first-rate
      yet—then Patti<sup><a href="#n0466" id="r5">5</a></sup>, a lady—&amp; others. It was in quite a fine hall here called
      Lincoln Hall<sup><a href="#duk.00664_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup>—I go there once in a while—(an editor
      of a newspaper here sends me spare tickets some times—that's how I go, most of the
      time.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have got a letter from John Burroughs<sup><a href="#duk.00664_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup>—he is at
      Middletown, N. Y.—don't expect to return here permanently to live any more—but
      will return to pack up &amp; move—his wife is still here—I was up there a couple
      of evenings since—Mrs. B. is alone—has lately been vaccinated, &amp; is not very
      well—there has been a good deal of small pox here—all the clerks in the office
      have been vaccinated—Well, 
      mamma
      
       dear, I believe I have scribbled down all the <em>small talk</em> I
      can think of to amuse you for this time—Love to you, mother dear,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <p id="duk.00664_n1">1. The executors dated this letter
      1868.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00664_n2">2. Walt Whitman had made a New Year's visit
      to Camden, according to Hannah Heyde's letter to her mother on January
      7–10, 1873 (Library of Congress); see also Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      letter to Helen Price on January 6(?), 1873 (Pierpont Morgan Library).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00664_n3">3. The issue of January 18, 1873 (9 1873,
      106–108) contained Burroughs's "A Glimpse of France."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0381">4. A farewell concert for Giuseppe Mario
      (1810–1883), "The World-renowned Tenor," and Carlotta Patti (1835?–1889),
      "The Queen of the Concert Room," was presented at Lincoln Hall on January 14,
      1873. The review in the <em>Daily Morning Chronicle</em> the next
      day gave greater praise to a young contralto, Annie Louise Cary, than to Patti
      or Mario, the latter of whom sang with "great effort." Walt Whitman referred to
      Mario frequently in his prose writings (<em>The Complete Writings
         of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 10 vols., IV, 26;
      VI, 186; VII, 56).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00664_n5">7. On , Burroughs wrote: "It cost me a pang to leave W[ashington]. I was
      so warm &amp; snug &amp; my nest was so well feathered; but I have really cut
      loose &amp; do not expect to return again except briefly. I can make more money
      here, be much freer, be nearer home &amp; have a new field of duties." Burroughs
      became a bank inspector in New York State.<a href="#r7">[back]
