   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4317">1. William Dean Howells
      (1837â€“1920) was an American realist novelist and literary critic, serving
      the staff of the <em>New York Nation</em> and <em>Harper's Magazine</em> during the mid 1860s. During his tenure as
      editor-in-chief of <em> The Atlantic Monthly</em> from 1871 to
      1880, he was one of the foremost critics in New York, and used his influence to
      support American authors like Hamlin Garland, Stephen Crane, and Emily
      Dickinson. He also brought attention to European authors like Henrik Ibsen,
      Giovanni Verga, and Leo Tolstoy in particular. Howells was highly skeptical of
      Whitman's poetry, however, and frequently questioned his literary merit. In an
      Ashtabula <em> Sentinel </em>review of the 1860 edition <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, Howells wrote, "If he is indeed 'the
      distinctive poet of America,' then the office of poet is one which must be left
      hereafter to the shameless and the friendless. for WALT WHITMAN is not a man
      whom you would like to know." In 1865, Howells would write the first important
      review of <em> Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Round
         Table</em>, demonstrating early signs of his conflicted opinion about
      Whitman. For more information on Howells, see Goodman, Susan &amp; Dawson, Carl,
      <em>William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life</em> (Berkeley:
      University of California Press, 2005).<a href="#r1">[back]
