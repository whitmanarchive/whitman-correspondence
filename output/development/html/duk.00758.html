      <br></br><br></br>Dear Tom
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter has just come all right &amp; I am glad to hear from you again. Every
      thing seems to go lovely there with you &amp; the boys &amp; Dr B (which is as
      it should be)—Tom, I often think of you all, &amp; of the last night we all
      got together, &amp; of the friendly parting drink we all had out there on the
      lawn—seems as if I only got to know you &amp; all best &amp; then time for me
      to clear out—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have some good times here in moderation—I cant go around very lively, but I
      enjoy what's going on wherever I go—This 31st of May coming I shall be
      62—but thank the Lord I still feel young at heart &amp; cheery as
      ever—After I returned last fall from Canada I was first rate all
      along—put in four good months—had some rare old times—will tell
      you when we meet, Tom—but some six weeks ago was careless enough to get badly
      chill'd all through my whole body, &amp; repeated the next day—So I have been
      since quite under the weather—But I am getting over it &amp; feeling quite
      myself again—I find I can be well enough if I take very particular care of
      myself, how I go, &amp;c—
   </p>
   
   <p>An old doctor here said to me "Whitman you are like an old wagon, built of first rate
      stuff, &amp; the best sort of frame &amp; wheels &amp; nuts—&amp; as long as
      you are mighty careful, &amp; go slow, &amp; <em>Keep to good
         roads</em>, you will last as long as any of us—but if you get on bad
      roads, or cut up any capers, then <em>look out</em>"—I go down
      every week or two (I go tomorrow again) about 20 miles from here right into the
      country, with a family of farmers, dear friends of mine, named Stafford—Keep a
      country store also—a big family of boys &amp; girls, &amp; Mrs S one of the
      kindest &amp; best women in the world—how much happier one can be when there
      is good women around—Does me good to be with them all. Every thing is very old
      fashioned, just suits me—good grub &amp; plenty of it. My great loafing place
      out there is a big old woods, mostly pine &amp; oak, but lots of laurel &amp; holly,
      old paths &amp; roads every where through the thick woods—I spend hours there
      every day—have it all to myself—go out there well-protected, even in a
      snow storm—rabbits &amp; squirrels, &amp; lots of birds beginning
      already—Tom, you would laugh to see me the way I amuse myself, often spouting
      terrible pieces 
      Shakspere
      
       or Homer as loud as I can yell. (But that always was a
      favorite practice of mine—I used to do it in the din of Broadway New York from
      the top of an omnibus—at other times along the seashore at Coney
      Island)—
   </p>
   
   <p>Tom, my paper is fill'd &amp; I must close—I wanted to write something about
      the running &amp; matches, but must postpone it—Give my love to all my friends
      there &amp; you yourself, dear boy—
   </p>
