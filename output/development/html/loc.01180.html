   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01180_n1">1. John Burroughs, the
      naturalist, became acquainted with Whitman during the Civil War and remained a
      steadfast friend; see <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin
      Haviland Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1961–69], 1:14). The
      transaction referred to in the note was also recorded in Whitman's Commonplace
      Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). At this time Whitman
      lived with George and Louisa Orr Whitman, whose only son, Walter Orr Whitman,
      had died on July 12; see <em>The Correspondence</em>, 3:54.<a href="#r1">[back]
