      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just written to Walt, and although it is pretty late, I must write you a few
      lines while my hand is in, to let you know that I am well and hearty. We have had
      a very heavy storm here for the last 48 hours, raining and blowing like great guns,
      but it appears to be about played out now. There has been a movement on foot here
      for the last Three days but I dont think it will amount to anything as I am afraid the storm has interfeered with the movement and spoiled Burnsides plans.<sup><a href="#duk.00335_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> The Army commenced to move from here early on Tuesday morning last, going somewhere
      up the river, but I dont know how far. I believe our Army Corps are the only troops left here, (but you musent say anything about it Mother or the rebs might hear of it and come over here and
      eat us all up) &nbsp;my oppinion is, that it was intended to throw a heavy force accross the river, somewhere above here, and let them come down and attack Fredericksburg
      in the rear or on the flank while we occupied their attention in front, with our Batteries
      on this side of the river, but whatever the plan was, I believe it had to be given
      up, on account of the storm, or it would have been commenced before now.
   </p>
   
   <p>I forget whether I have written home, since I got the letter from Jeff, with the money,
      or not, &nbsp;anyhow the money came all right. I got a letter from Walt. to night with
      a lot of postage stamps and envelopes allready directed some to you Mammy, and some to Jeff. Walt says he has a prospect of getting
      a pretty good berth in Washington.<sup><a href="#duk.00335_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Heyde wrote me a letter a few days ago saying that Hannah was quite sick, and I immediately
      wrote to Walt to either go on there and bring her home, or make some arangement to have her come on at once. &nbsp;and in his letter to night Walt says he is confident
      she is either home or on her way there. I hope she is not as sick as Heyde makes it
      apear, but we would all feel a great deal better satisfied if she was home. Mother tell
      her to write to me as soon as she gets home.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well Mother how are you all getting along, &nbsp;Mattie and Sis I hope are well, somehow
      or another I cant help thinking of Sis as she was when I came away &nbsp;I cant seem to make out how big she must be by
      this time, and I think if you would write me, how many pancakes she can eat I could
      tell about how much she has grown since I came away.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well Mother it is getting chilly sitting here in my tent as the fire has gone out,
      so I must bid you,
   </p>

      good night

   <p id="duk.00335_n1">1. Ambrose Everett Burnside
      (1824-1881) organized the First Rhode Island Infantry at the outbreak of the
      war. He was then in command of the Expedition Against the Coast of North
      Carolina. Burnside intended to make a second attempt to capture the city of
      Fredericksburg.<a href="#r1">[back]

      Eldridge, whose Boston publishing house of Thayer and Eldridge had published the
      third edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860) before the firm
      went to the wall and who was then Assistant to the Army Paymaster, Whitman
      secured an appointment as a copyist in the Paymaster's Office. The position
      occupied him for only a few hours a day, but paid him enough to meet living
      expenses and allowed him time to visit the wounded and sick soldiers in the
      Washington hospitals (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer: A
         Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: New York University
