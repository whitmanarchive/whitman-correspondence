      country—never did the spring impress me more—it was just the right
      temperature—the very sun &amp; wind and grass with sort o' human
      relations—(what a beautiful object is a young wheat field! what
      color!)—Had a good supper, oysters &amp; champagne, at my friends the
      Harneds<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> in the evn'g—I only eat two meals a
      day—
