      <br></br><br></br>Dear Abby:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have leave of absence commencing first of next week, and intend coming on to New
      York, 
      for a while, to spend the first part of it. Are you so fixed that 
      you can give me a room? You must answer candidly no, if not—please write at once—I
      am well as usual—nothing very new or important with me. 
      The advent of the new Attorney General, Mr. Evarts,<sup><a href="#pml.00025_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> does not seem likely to affect my position here.<sup><a href="#pml.00025_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> 
      But there have been many dismissals of clerks in the Departments. The O'Connors are
      well—the little girl has picked up amazingly—goes about, indeed, as strong &amp; nimble
      as a grasshopper—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In a late letter, Mother said she had not seen any thing of Helen or 
      Emily for some time—I suppose you have been off in the country.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Love to all—&amp; good bye for the present.</p>

      bears the address, "Mrs Abby H. Price, | 331 East 55th street, | bet 1st &amp;

   <p id="pml.00025_n2">2. William Maxwell Evarts
      (1818–1901) was chief counsel for Andrew Johnson during the impeachment
      trial of 1868. As a reward for his services, Johnson appointed Evarts Attorney
      General later in the year; Evarts was Secretary of State from 1877 to 1881 and
      U.S. Senator from New York from 1885 to 1891.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="pml.00025_n3">3. On , however, O'Connor wrote
      cryptically to Walt Whitman: "I had a long and free talk with [Ashton] about Mat
      Pleasants and Evarts, in connexion with you, which I must tell you about when we
      meet. It made me feel quite anxious, but I guess all's right, while Ashton is
      there. Pleasants is a miserable devil. I wish I had power in that office for a
      little while. I'd put a spoke in the wheel of his vendetta, which would carry it
      and him to a safe distance."<a href="#r3">[back]
