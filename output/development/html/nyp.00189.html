      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have had the misfortune to fall back a little since I wrote to you—I have had three
      or four pretty bad days &amp; nights—but I am feeling decidedly brighter this afternoon,
      &amp; have no doubt I shall be myself again before long. The trouble has been as before,
      bad spells of weakness with heavy aching head—I think the throat is no worse, but
      it is not well yet—
   </p>
   
   <p>William, I rec'd your letter to-day, also one from Charles Eldridge, with one in envelope—as
      to the future, &amp; as to our meeting again, I have no doubt we shall meet again &amp; have
      good times—if Nelly has not gone when this reaches you, I wish her to consider it
      just the same as if written to her—I do not write much, nor do any thing hardly, but
      keep as quiet as possible—my physician thinks that time, with the change of locality,
      &amp; my own latent recuperative power, will make me well, but says my system is probably
      saturated with the virus of the hospitals &amp;c which eludes ordinary treatment—&amp;c &amp;c
      &amp;c—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have nothing new or interesting to write you. I intend to move heaven &amp; earth to
      publish my "Drum-Taps" as soon as I am able to go around.
   </p>
   
   <p>So Eldridge is down at Petersburgh<sup><a href="#nyp.00189_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>—if I were there at Washington &amp; well I should want no better fun than accompanying
      them—When you see Count<sup><a href="#nyp.00189_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> tell him I sent him my love—also Ashton—I will write should there be any change in
      my condition—
   </p>
   
   <p>Good bye for present, my dear friend, &amp; God bless you<sup><a href="#nyp.00189_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
      John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp;
      Eldridge in 1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an
      intelligent man who deserved something better than the various governmental
      clerical posts he was to hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship,
      however, was relieved by the presence of Whitman whom he was to love and
      venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
      vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
      pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
      important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
      those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
      O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
      sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
      first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910] pp. 513). For more
      on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>. Of the O'Connors, Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman wrote on : "I am
      real glad, my dear Walt, that you are among such good people. I hope it will be
      in the power of some of our family to return their kindness some day. I'm sure
      twould be done with a heartfelt gratitude. Tis pleasant, too, to think, that
      there are still people of that kind left."In his letter of , O'Connor was deeply moved by
      Whitman's departure from Washington: "Many thoughts of you have come to me since
      you went away, and sometimes it has been lonely and a little like death.
      Particularly at evening when you used to come in . . . I wonder what the future
      for us is to be. Shall we triumph over obscurities and obstacles and emerge to
      start the Pathfinder, or whatever the name of it is to be? . . . Or shall we
      never meet, never work together, never start any Pathfinder, never do anything
      but fade out into death, frustrated, lost in oblivion? . . . I hardly believe
      you will come back here. But I hope you
      will."

   <p id="nyp.00189_n4">3. Count Adam Gurowski
      (1805–1866), a Polish exile, published an eccentric three-volume Diary
      (1862–1866), a day-by-day account of the war written with a marked
      partiality toward extreme abolitionists. The Count was a colorful figure: he
      covered his lost eye with a "green blinder," and "he had a Roman head...a
      powerful topknot, in and out: people always stopped to look at him" (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York, Rowman
      and Littlefield, 1961], 3:79, 96). William D. O'Connor, who apparently
      translated Gurowski's manuscripts into English (see the letter from Gurowski to
      O'Connor in Feinberg), reported to Walt Whitman, on , that "he is a madman with lucid intervals"—he had
      attempted "to discipline the firemen with a
      pistol."
      Walt Whitman maintained to Traubel, in 1888, that "he was truly a remarkable,
      almost phenomenal, man," and that "he was, no doubt, very crazy, but also very
      sane" (3:79, 340). O'Connor related in a letter on , that the Count had said to her recently: "My Gott,
      I did not know that [Walt Whitman] was such a poet, tell him so, I have been
      trying every where to find him to tell him myself." In the last volume of the
      Diary, Gurowski placed Walt Whitman's name in the first category of his
      threefold evaluation of persons "mentioned in this volume": "Praise," "Half and
      Half," and "Blame." The Count referred in his entry for April 18, 1864, to Walt
      Whitman as among "the most original and genuine American hearts and minds"
      (187). In a footnote (372–373), appended September 12, 1865, Gurowski
      abused Harlan, who had "shown himself to be animated by a spirit of
      narrow-minded persecution that would honor the most fierce Spanish or Roman
      inquisitor." Gurowski was praised by Robert Penn Warren, in Malcolm Cowley, ed.,
      <em>Writers at Work: The "Paris Review" Interviews</em>, (New
      York: Viking, 1958), 189. See also LeRoy Fischer, <em>Mississippi
         Valley Historical Review</em>, 36 (1949–1950): 415–434, and the
      <em>Dictionary of American Biography, Supplement One</em> (New
      York: Scribner, 1944).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00189_n5">4. On , Ellen M. O'Connor asked Whitman what
      she should do with "Mrs. Beach's notes." Mrs. Juliette H. Beach was one of those
      enigmatic women associated with Whitman about whom imaginative biographers have
      spun ingenious theories. Mrs. Beach was to have reviewed the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> for the <em>Saturday
         Press</em>, but when her husband's unfavorable review was published instead,
      the journal had to take public note of matrimonial discord in order to correct
      the error (Gay Wilson Allen, The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt
      Whitman [New York: Macmillan, 1955; rev. ed., New York University Press, 1967],
      260–262). Mrs. O'Connor contributed her bit to the theory that Mrs. Beach
      and Whitman had a love affair when she asserted that "Out of the Rolling Ocean,
      the Crowd," published in <em>Drum-Taps</em>, was composed for "a
      certain lady" who had angered her husband because of her correspondence with the
      poet (Emory Holloway, ed., <em>The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of
         Walt Whitman</em> [Garden City, New York: Doubleday, Page, 1921], 1:lviii).
      "Mrs. Beach's notes" may be the letters to Whitman, which later Burroughs vainly
      asked Mrs. Beach to print; see Clara Barrus, Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades
      (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931) and <em>The Life and Letters
         of John Burroughs</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1925), 1:120. If these
      were love letters, Whitman hardly treated Mrs. Beach's heart-stirrings
      discreetly. See also Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em>,
      340–342.<a href="#r4">[back]
