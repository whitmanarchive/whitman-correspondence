      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your welcome epistle of the 24th of April came to hand this morning and found me in
      good health and as usual very glad to hear from you. My Brothers James &amp; Joseph are
      both well and in the Regt and wish me to return thanks for your kind remembrance of
      them
   </p>
   
   <p>I received a letter from you written at Brooklyn bearing date of the 13th of April
      we marched from Burksville the following day. I have not had a chance to answer it.
      We finished our march to this place last Thursday afternoon and as soon as we halted
      my Regiment were ordered on Picket where we remained three days, consequently I could
      not write; and since we came in from picket we have been under marching orders. By
      the way we are waiting transportation towards Petersburgh. Our train started yesterday
      morning and about tomorrow we will start. We wait now for the Cars to return which
      took the 2nd Brigade of the Division in that direction on Monday. The soldiers have
      not emerged from the gloom which was cast over their minds on hearing of the death
      of our Beloved President. My heart is to full to write anything about him, for I cannot
      tell how well he was liked by the Soldiers who fought for the Flag under him. I am
      pained to say that many of my company secretly rejoiced when we received the news
      of the assasination. But none dared to cheer although if some Rebel had proposed it there were plenty
      ready to join in. All I want is to see the assassin dealt with if caught in a proper
      manner.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of seeing you in Washington when I will tell
      you a great many things that I cannot write. Look out for me when you hear the 1st
      Div. of the 6th corps coming to Washington.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are kept very close now on account of the Orders for going back. Otherwise I would
      try to visit the Prison Camp and also the burying ground. There are a large number
      of my comrades buried there and I should like to have the satisfaction of seeing their
      graves.
   </p>
   
   <p>Should you see Miss Howard please remember me to her.<sup><a href="#nyp.00178_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> Hoping to see you soon I will close for the present. Please write me before unless
      you hear of the Corps coming home. Yours truly.
   </p>

      14, 1864. The twenty-year-old boy had been "shot through shoulder, ball in
      lung—(ball still in probably near lung)—lost right finger." On June 23, 1864, he
      went home to Vernon, N. J., on furlough, and then served as assistant cook in
      the army hospital in Newark. On ,
      Mullery proposed a visit to Brooklyn. He was still at the Newark hospital on
