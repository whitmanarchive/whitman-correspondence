      <br></br>Somerset House, W.C.
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">15 June, '77
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received some little while ago your post-card of 3 May, &amp; felt obliged to you for having sent the books to Mr. Cozens, without
      waiting for actual receipt of the money—wh., as before stated, is in my hands.<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r1">1</a></sup> The only reason why, contrary to my usual practice, I have so long delayed sending
      it on to you is that I have been looking out for any other stray subscriptions, promised
      but not yet paid, wh. c.d be sent along with Mr. Cozens's in a Bank-order—or, if more convenient, a P.O. order.
      On receipt of your card (other such subscriptions not making their appearance
      
      
      
      at present) I was intending to send C's money at once by P.O. order; but then, some
      little while ago now, Minto,<sup><a href="#n0825" id="r2">2</a></sup> the Editor of The Examiner, started in talk with me, of his own accord, the subject
      of the money that he owes for your article, &amp; he proposed to send it round to me at
      once—wh. of course I approved. This again made me hold over the dispatching of the P.O. order
      for C.s money, but as yet, after all, no symptom of Minto's remittance appears. One
      of these days C.'s money will be properly sent off to you—accompanied, let us hope,
      by some other, but if not then by itself. I enter into all these tiresome details
      because an explanation of my delay is due to you: but I fear you will think them quite
      as bothering as the delay itself.
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>It is a goodish while ago—
      
      
      
      say 6 weeks—that I wrote to Dowden<sup><a href="#n0199" id="r3">3</a></sup> in Dublin, enquiring about those subscribers who volunteered thro him (not holding any direct communication with me), &amp; who have not yet paid. Dowden
      has not yet replied to me: when he does so, it will behove me to look into the details of <u>all</u> the outstanding subscriptions, &amp; get the affair finally closed.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Lately,—say 3 weeks ago—I received a letter from Australia, of wh. I enclose some extracts, along with the printed matter wh. accompanied it. I replied the other day, giving the writer Mr. Adams<sup><a href="#n0826" id="r4">4</a></sup> my last news of your health, &amp; enclosing also a copy of my last circular (summer
      of 1876) regarding your new editions—not without some hope that some few Australians
      here &amp; there may do themselves
      
      
      
      the good-service of ordering copies. Mr. A.'s wish for a copy of my "full Review"
      of you (as he terms it, meaning of course the introduction to the selection from your
      Poems wh. I published in 1868) has been attended to—the Publishers sending him a copy [I hardly
      thought there was any remaining] of the book. The tone of his letter is agreeable
      to me, &amp; I hope it will be the same to you: his name had not previously been known
      to me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Please remember me to Mrs. Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r5">5</a></sup>—or <u>us</u>, I sh.d rather say. My wife received lately a letter from Mrs. G. to serve as an introduction for an American lady, Mrs. Edwards. To the latter my wife sent a card for a gathering at our house of a few
      friends on 14 June, &amp; we had the
      
      
      
      pleasure of seeing Mrs. E. &amp; her son accordingly. I was glad to hear from her a good account of the G.'s
      generally, tho she thinks Philadelphia is anything but a favourable field for the painting career
      of Herbert.<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I have by me a note written long ago (6 Jan?) by Foote,<sup><a href="#n0828" id="r7">7</a></sup> Editor of The Secularist, to say that, before receiving my then last note on the
      subject, he had sent on to you direct the subscription-money in his hands. This, I
      suppose, is all right, within your cognizance.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I enclose a note written to you by C.P. O'Conor,<sup><a href="#n0829" id="r8">8</a></sup> &amp; shall without delay forward to you by post the vol. of his poems. In a note addressed
      to
      
      
      
      me he says: "Will you kindly tell Whitman that the writer is one of his ardent admirers,
      &amp; that it was a rich treat to read in your American Poems those of Walt Whitman's
      production." I never <u>met</u> Mr. O'Conor: but he has addressed me from time to time about his little vol. of poems,
      &amp; other such matters.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Not very long ago I received a letter from Mr. Marvin<sup><a href="#n0830" id="r9">9</a></sup> offering a prospect, rather more definite than hitherto, of your coming to look a
      little about you in England, &amp; perhaps on the European Continent. I can but repeat
      my delight in this prospect, were it to be realized, &amp; my wife's hope &amp; my own that
      you will not, in such case, fail to give
      
      
      us some of your company in this house, Euston Sq..
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have had a rather noticeable season here. Up to 2 June, nothing that was worthy
      the name even of Spring: then suddenly on 3 June hot summer, wh. continues till now—but less decidedly these 2 days.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am interested in hearing that the Bostonians mean to cut us out—&amp; we deserve it
      for our neglectful tardy stolidity—&amp; erect a statue to our poet Shelley.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0522">1. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0825">2. William Minto (1845–1893) was
      a Scottish literary critic, editor and writer. He was the editor of <em>The Examiner</em> from 1874 to 1878. See Alexander Mackie's
      entry on Minto in <em>Dictionary of National Biography,
         1885-1900</em>, ed. Sir Leslie Stephen &amp; Sir Sidney Lee Lazarus,
      (London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co., 1885-1901, vol. 38).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0199">3. Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>). For more, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_93.html">Dowden, Edward (1843–1913)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0826">4. According to Roger W. Peattie, the
      writer Adams mentioned by Rossetti in this letter is Robert Dudley Adams
      (1829-1912). Adams was an Australian businessman, journalist and writer. See
      Philip Mennell's entry on him in <em>Dictionary of Australasian
         Biography</em> (London: Hutchinson, 1892).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0259">5. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">6. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0828">7. George William Foote
      (1850–1915) was a British republican, secularist, and journalist. He
      edited <em>The Secularist</em> from 1876 to 1877, together with
      George Jacob Holyoake.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0829">8. Charles Patrick O'Conor
      (1837–?) was an Irish poet, known as "the Irish peasant poet," who went to
      live in England during his youth. He published <em>Songs of a
         Life: Wayside Chants; Fatherland</em> (London: Kentish Mercury Office, 1875)
      and <em>Wreaths of Fancy</em> (London: John Vickers, 1870). See
      Catherine Reilly, <em>Mid-Victorian Poetry 1860-1879: an Annotated
         Bibliography</em> (London: Mansell, 2000), 345.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0830">9. Joseph B. Marvin, a friend and
      an admirer of Whitman's poetry, was from 1866 to 1867 the co-editor of the <em>Radical</em>. He was then appointed as a clerk in the Treasury
      Department in Washington, on behalf of which he took a trip to London in the
      late fall of 1875. On , Whitman
      wrote a letter to William Michael Rossetti to announce a visit from Marvin.
      Rossetti gave a dinner for Marvin, which was attended by the following "good
      Whitmanites": Anne Gilchrist; Joseph Knight, editor of the London <em>Sunday Times</em>; Justin McCarthy, a novelist and writer for
      the London <em>Daily News</em>; Edmund Gosse; and Rossetti's
      father-in-law, Ford Madox
      Brown.<a href="#r9">[back]
