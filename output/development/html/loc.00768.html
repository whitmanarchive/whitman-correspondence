      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter came safe, and was very welcome, &amp; always will be—Mother, I am sorry about
      your rheumatism—If it still continues, I think it would be well for me to write a
      line to Mrs. Piercy,<sup><a href="#loc.00768_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; get Jeff to stop with it, so that you could take the baths again, as I am sure
      they are very beneficial—Dear mother, you write me, or Jeff must in the next letter,
      how you are getting along, whether it is any better, or worse—I want to know.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, about George's fund in the bank, I hope by all means you can scratch along
      so as to leave $250 there—I am so anxious that our family should have a little ranch, even if it
      is the meanest kind, off somewhere that you can call your own, &amp; that would do for
      Ed, &amp;c.—it might be a real dependence, &amp; comfort—and may-be for George as much as
      any one. I mean to come home one of these days, and get the acre or ½ acre somewhere
      out in some by-place on Long Island, &amp; build it, you see if I dont. About Hannah,<sup><a href="#loc.00768_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> dear mother, I hardly know what advice to give you—from what I know at present, I
      cant tell what course to pursue. I want Han to come home, from the bottom of my heart. Then there are other
      thoughts &amp; considerations that come up. Dear mother, I cannot advise, but shall acquiesce
      in any thing that is settled upon, &amp; try to help.
   </p>
   
   <p>The condition of things here in the Hospitals is getting pretty bad—the wounded from
      the battles around Fredericksburg are coming up in large numbers.<sup><a href="#loc.00768_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> It is very sad to see them. I have written to Mr. Lane, asking him to get his friends
      to forward me what they think proper—but somehow I feel delicate about sending such requests, after all.<sup><a href="#loc.00768_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have almost made up my mind to do what I can personally, &amp; not seek assistance from
      others.
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Mother, I have not received any letter from George. I write to him &amp; send papers
      to Winchester. Mother, while I have been writing this, a very large number of southern
      prisoners, I should think 1000 at least, has past up Pennsylvania avenue, under a
      strong guard. I went out in the street, close to them, to look at them. Poor fellows,
      many of them mere lads—it brought the tears, they seemed our own flesh &amp; blood too,
      some wounded, all miserable in clothing, all in dirt &amp; tatters—many of them fine young
      men. Mother, I cannot tell you how I feel to see these prisoners marched [<em>incomplete</em>]

   <p id="loc.00768_n1">1. Henry R. Piercy operated
      sulphur baths at 5 Willoughby Avenue, Brooklyn, New York.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00768_n2">2. Jeff wrote of Hannah on
      : "We have not heard from Han since
      the letter that I sent you. I suppose she is about the same. Mother speaks of
      sending for her &amp;c and then says she hardly knows what to do. Tis rather a
      puzzling question I confess. I hope however that she will come home herself
      before long. It certainly is a great relief not to be cursed with letters from
      Heyde every few days."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00768_n3">3. In his diary Whitman
      noted on May 4: "Tonight the wounded begin to arrive from Hooker's command"; on
      May 6: "Very bad for Hooker"; and on May 7: "Last night we heard of Hooker
      recrossing the Rappahannock—news very distressing" (Charles I. Glicksberg, ed.,
      <em>Walt Whitman and the Civil War</em> (Philadelphia:
      University of Pennsylvania Press, 1933), 134–135). The <em>New York Tribune</em> printed lengthy lists of the wounded on May 9, 1863,
      and May 11, 1863.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00768_n4">4. This letter to Moses Lane
      is not known. Lane (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn
      Water Works from 1862 to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee
      Water Works and served there as city engineer. Like Jeff, he collected money
      from his employees and friends to give to Walt's hospital efforts during the
      Civil War. In his letter of , Lane
      pledged $5 each month. Similarly, Lane sent dollar contributions from six
      individuals on . In an unpublished
      manuscript in the Berg Collection, Whitman wrote, obviously for publication: "I
      have distributed quite a large sum of money, contributed for that purpose by
      noble persons in Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief
      Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane also assisted Whitman in other ways. He was
      so solicitous of Whitman's personal welfare that on , he sent through Jeff $5 "for your own especial
      benefit."<a href="#r4">[back]
