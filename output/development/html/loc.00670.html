      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Brother
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I 
      rec'd
      
       your card and Book, some little time since was <u>glad</u> to hear how you was.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Has not 
      Dr
      
       Bucke done grandly, splendidly, I was so much interested I sat up two nights 
      till
      
       after twelve, when it first came. It is just perfect, the pictures, book,
      everything
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am glad to have it, the pictures are <u>very fine</u>,—(I like 
      Mr O Connor) I 
      cant
      
       tell you Walt how much I prize the book
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope to live to see you and have a good talk. I am writing in a hurry, Charlie was
      going down town. I took a notion all at once to send my pictures, I have  not been very
      prompt have I Walt about the pictures these were taken four months ago,
      I intended to go and have a full face taken, did go again to Atwoods, he was buisy
      these I send of his are bad are not a good likeness, Browns, look more like me.
      Charlie did not like Browns at all at first (he does not say so much against them
      now) so of
      course I felt disappointed. If I get a good full face I will send it. I am afraid
      these will not be very satisfactory. I 
      dont
      
       make a good picture
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Charlie starts for the Adirondacks Monday, I have been busy getting his things all
      right. I 
      dont
      
       know how long he will stay some weeks certainly.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear Walt I am always so glad to hear from you, I think about you often and always
      I
      send you and all the rest ever and ever so much love, I am pretty well now have not
      been quite well, after all there is really <u>no</u> real
      sickness no disease the only thing about it Walt is I have fretted and worried make
      myself sick almost sometimes. I must turn over a new leaf &amp;
      do better
