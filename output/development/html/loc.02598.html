      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr
      
      W.
      
      
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thanks
      for the 
      N. A.
      
       Review. I had already read two or three times 
      yr
      
       admirable, cheerful &amp; spirited paper, &amp; wanted to buy it but did
      not feel able. I
      think (though I am not sure) that an article on it will appear in <u>The American</u> soon, by a couple of us. You will be safe in
      attributing the praise to me, though I "have somewhat against you" for rapping the
      <u>dii
         minores</u> among our poets, so hard over the coxcombs. Still it will do
      them good doubtless. They have treated you ungenerously &amp; foppishly—always (most
      of them).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You have no idea how I welcome an utterance of yrs. I get so utterly sick of the idiocy and knavery of the mass that it is like a
      sea-breeze to feel &amp; hear your voice.
      
      It tickles my diaphragm to see
      you run 
      yr
      
       huge subsoil prairie plough so deep down under the feet of the
      Lilliputians—knocking down their sham structures &amp; leaving them either
      sprawling on the ground, or looking foolishly at one another because exposed in their
      small
      trickeries, &amp; small literary bookeries.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I <u>heartily</u> congratulate you, dear friend, that at last you
      are having justice done you (in some degree) by the literary class of this country.
      <u>My</u> heart, at least, swells with gladness &amp; pride
      on account of 
      yr
      
       honors this winter. It is a red letter season in 
      yr
      
       life—The honor not much; but then one likes to stand well at home
      too, as well as abroad;—one likes it a little better too.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>But I have never wondered that you were caviare to the general; because, although
      I see clearly
      that 
      yr
      
       object in treating the passions as you do is a noble &amp; pure one; yet I
      have thought that the world was not ready for such a move yet. And besides, I am
      inclined to think with Stedman, that (to such poor limited and petty creatures as
      we bipeds
      are) there is something intrinsically disagreeable in the various grosser functions
      of the body.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope we shall grow to be such giants sometime that this will not be so. But that
      it
      is the case now, I do not see how we can help admitting. I can't for my poor self
      at
      any rate. But never mind this, I congratulate you again on this success.
   </p>
