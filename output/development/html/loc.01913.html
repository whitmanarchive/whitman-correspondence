      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Before the old year is closing I will send you a few lines only to express the hope,
      that you may enter into the new year in an ameliorated [
      <span class="unclear">state?</span>]
       of health mind and body! Your answer to
      my letter from [
      <span class="unclear">Garsdal?</span>]
      
      I duely received. A 
      forthnight
      
       after the receipt of it I sent you a number of Danish [
      <span class="unclear">Kolkets dent?</span>]
       (Danish
      people's paper) with a criticism of your book by Mr Termansen—a very bad
      one.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>The author is a peasant, member of one Danish house of the Commons, originally a
      gifted man, but at present one of the spoiled [
      <span class="unclear">dalsegs?</span>]
       of the haut ton Copenhagen society. Even into the
      greatest assemblies he appears in the coarse Luffs of the Danish peasants' home
      dress;—vanity! He is one of what Bjornion 
      with a very happy expression calls [
      <span class="unclear">them?</span>]
       pale-born peasants.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If you have had the criticisms especially Elate's , completely
      translated for you I should like to know what impression all these foreign judgments
      may have made on you.
      The least benevolent of them are, you will allow, far more benevolent than your
      homely American criticism. But you have many friends, male and female, here, who
      don't write criticisms.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been 
      accostumed
      
       to receive papers and small parcels from you and have always been glad for
      it, even when I forgot to share you. In the last five months I have received
      nothing. Earnestly hoping that the reason may not be, that your illness has
      increased
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The Swede Peter Carl Rudolph
      Schmidt (1836–1899) was the editor of the idealist <em>For
         Idé og Virkelighed</em> ("For Idea and Reality") and had translated
      Whitman's <em>Democratic Vistas</em> into Danish in 1871 (see the
      letter from Schmidt to Whitman of ).
