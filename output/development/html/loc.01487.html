       Draft letter. 
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Dowden, Dowden
      (1843–1913), professor of English literature at the University of
      Dublin, sent a copy of his article with a letter on July 23, 1871:
       "I ought to say
      that the article expresses very partially the impression which your writings
      have made on me. It keeps, as is obvious, at a single point of view, &amp;
      regards only what becomes visible from that point. But also I wrote more
      cooly than I feel because I wanted those, who being ignorant of your
      writings are perhaps prejudiced against them, to say 'Here is a cool,
      judicious, impartial critic who finds a great deal in Whitman—
      perhaps, after all, we are mistaken'" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection;
      Horace Traubel, ed., <em xmlns="">With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (1906–1964), 5 vols., 1:134). Note also Dowden's comments to
      Burroughs, in Clara Barrus, <em xmlns="">Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> (1931), 67. On three occasions in 1870
      Dowden had written to Rossetti about his difficulties in having his article
      published; see <em xmlns="">Rossetti Papers</em>, 517–518, 519,
      520. In 1888 Walt Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but he
      is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (I, 299). 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received your kind letter, &amp; your review in the Westminster, &amp; thank
      you heartily. I wish to write you at more length, &amp; may do so before long. I
      take real comfort in the thought that I have such friends in Ireland, including
      yourself. I wish to hear more of Mr. Tyrrell, R. Y. Tyrrell, a fellow of Trinity College and "an excellent
      Greek scholar," had recently delivered a public lecture on Walt Whitman's
      poetry; see Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> (1906–1964), 5 vols., 1:135, 225.  whom you speak
      of.
