      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your p.c. of yesterday came at breakfast time.<sup><a href="#loc.02953_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I often wish that I <u>could</u> write you a long letter, &amp; tell you all about
      us, but as I wrote you, my head &amp; eyes <u>gave out</u>, &amp;
      I can write but very little, even to my two sisters,— &amp; we are all that
      are left of the family of nine, seven children &amp; the father &amp; mother. But
      one  night last week I
      had a most vivid dream of you, &amp; thought I should write that day, but the many
      duties that came each day prevented it. I am sorry that I have not better news to
      give you of William.<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> He has failed very much in the last six weeks, indeed I date
      the marked change for the worse from the paralysis of the eye lid, &amp; that was
      the last of Sept., but a very marked change for the worse since  Nov. 23d. No one is as
      well aware of it as I am, for I see him at his worst, as well as his best. I am his
      sole &amp; only nurse, &amp; help to dress, undress &amp; bathe him, &amp; he is
      under no restraint to say how he <u>always</u> puts the best face
      on things to every one, &amp; is always ready to joke about himself, &amp; often
      makes me laugh when I am ready to cry. But now he often debates whether he shall  go out at all, &amp;
      does not go till 11 or 10:30 A.M. &amp; sometimes later. He, until very lately,
      would almost resent the idea of staying at home when I suggested it,—but
      locomotion is becoming more &amp; more labored, &amp; when I am helping him to get
      up &amp; down, I have sometimes wondered if I shall be able to lift him more &amp;
      more, as he is less able to lift himself, as he weighs 200 or more &amp; I 105.
      Until lately, too, he has had the most wonderful courage, &amp; would 
      <u>not</u> give up, but it is not so all the time now. Still,
      there is one thing in his favor, (if one so regards it) &amp; that is that he is
      still <u>determined</u> to live, I never saw such clinging to <u>this life</u>, in any one; &amp; he still feels that if
      the right doctor could be found that he could be made entirely well. He counted up
      the other day, &amp; found that he had had <u>fifteen</u>
      doctors. Besides the "<u>paresis</u>" he suffers from
      inconveniences of various  other kinds, which follow from his not being able to reach the
      water closet in time. Then he has had inflammation, some time ago, in one, &amp;
      then the other <u>toe</u>, lately the second finger of the right
      hand, was very bad, &amp; is not wholly well yet. I look at him &amp; wonder how any
      one can want to live who suffers so; the body seems to me such a <u>prison</u> under these conditions. But his deepest unhappiness
      now is that he has not yet been able to  get his article published which he wrote
      in defense of Donnelly,<sup><a href="#n4108" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; as yet, he has not. He put life
      &amp; energy into it, &amp; said if he could only get to New York he could get it
      into the right magazine.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are always glad of a word from you, &amp; hope that you are on the gain in earnest
      now. I need not tell you that the long strain of anxiety &amp; care has told deeply on
      me,—but I have 
      been upheld so far, &amp; have faith &amp; hope still,—&amp; <u>shall have</u>, <u>no matter what
         comes.</u></p>
   
   <p>With best love from us both.</p>

   <p>I ought to add that William sleeps well, &amp; has an excellent appetite, "almost
      too good," he says.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
