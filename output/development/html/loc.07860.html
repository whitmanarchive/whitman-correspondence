   <p>Your welcome card of 16th<sup><a href="#loc.07134_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> came to hand yesterday. My brother Eustace (Duke)<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r3">3</a></sup> was back again for the day and left for home (Ottawa) at 5.30 last evening.
   </p>
   
   <p>Splendid sleighing here and I thoroughly enjoy it—get out for a good drive every day—sometimes
      twice.
   </p>
   
   <p>This morning the air is cold but the sun shining like a lovely June morning, have
      just been to North Building with Dr. Beemer<sup><a href="#loc.07330_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> all going well and quietly at asylum.
   </p>
   
   <p>In the city the meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> affairs go on as usual "slow but sure" I think we shall be turning out meters within
      a month from now, have begun making but are not in a position yet to make all the
      parts n[eeded to] turn out meters. Xmas holidays now [illegible] us a little delay but not much.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
