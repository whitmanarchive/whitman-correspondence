   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00588_n8">1. The date January 19 is in
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year
      1870. Edwin Haviland Miller accepted Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:367). However, the delay in Louisa's comments on the death of
      Hannah Fleet and on a public outcry over smallpox vaccination raises some doubt
      about the date. Louisa almost always comments on recent local news within days,
      but the two matters that she mentions in this letter date to newspaper stories
      on January 6 and 7. The year 1870 is certain, but the letter may date earlier
      than January 19. Nonetheless, because the date is in Louisa's hand, the letter
      is assigned the date January 19, 1870.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n4">2. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n3">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00588_n11">4. Walt Whitman's January 17?,
      1870 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:362).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">5. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00588_n13">6. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      fear that her daughter-in-law would not live long enough to see her children
      reach adulthood would prove prophetic. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that led
      to her death in February 1873. At the time of her death, her daughter Manahatta
      was aged 12 years and her daughter Jessie Louisa 9 years. For Louisa's anguish
      over Mattie's death, see her  letter to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00588_n9">7. Samuel H. Moore is listed in
      the <em>Brooklyn Directory</em> (1871) as residing at Spencer near
      Willoughby. The Moore family's intended move is mentioned briefly in Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman's  letter to Walt
      Whitman, but they are otherwise unknown except that two other Moores, E. D. and
      John, also lived on Myrtle.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00588_n14">8. The Moore's "big house" was
      near the Whitman home on Portland Avenue near Myrtle, where Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman had resided with Thomas Jefferson Whitman and family during the Civil
      War.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00588_n18">9. Hannah (Strong) Fleet (b.
      1789), widow of Gilbert Fleet (1783–1854), died in early January 1870 in
      Babylon, Long Island ("Died," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>,
      January 7, 1870, 3). A John Fleet, probably their son, worked with Walt Whitman
      on the <em>Long Islander</em> ("Whitman, Editor Good Gray Poet,"
      <em>Long Islander</em>, June 9, 1905, rpt., <em>Whitman Supplement</em> [1978]).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00588_n15">10. For the vaccination
      procedures and the public outcry, see "The Public Health," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, January 6, 1870, 2.<a href="#r10">[back]
