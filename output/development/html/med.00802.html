   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sarah Anne Southall Tooley
      (1857–1946) was born in Staffordshire and took classes in literature at
      London University College. After her 1882 marriage to the minister George W.
      Tooley, she pursued a career in journalism. She authored numerous biographical
      sketches and earned a reputation as a talented interviewer who spoke to and
      wrote about women working in an array of fields, including several women writers
      and activists. She contributed to fin-de-sèicle periodicals such as the <em>Woman's Signal</em> and <em>Woman at Home</em>,
      and she is the author of <em>The Life of Florence Nightingale</em>
      (1905) and <em>The History of Nursing in the British Empire </em>
      (1906), among other works (Terri Doughty, "Representing the Professional Woman:
      The Celebrity Interviewing of Sarah Tooley," in <em>Women in
         Journalism at the Fin de Siècle 'Making a Name for Herself'</em>, ed.
      F. Elizabeth Gray [New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012], 165–181).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00802_n1">1. This note was written on
      the verso of the following letter: ". . . copyright in that country. | May I
      trouble you for an early reply? I am sorry that there is no way by which I can
      forward postage for your letter. | Yours truly | Sarah A. Tooley | Messrs Osgood
      &amp; Co." Since Walt Whitman's letter had nothing to do with the fragment of
      Sarah Tooley's, it is impossible to be certain that she was the recipient.
      Miller proposes this fragment of Tooley's letter was written in September or
      October 1881 when Walt Whitman was discussing the copyright of the Osgood
      edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (see Stadish James O'Grady's
      letter to Whitman of ). There are
      at least two possible explanations: Walt Whitman wrote a draft, an unusual
      procedure for such a trivial matter, or he wrote a reply on a piece of paper he
      found in the ever-present litter in his "den."<a href="#r1">[back]
