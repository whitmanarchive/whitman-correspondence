      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:    
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter was very welcome to me.<sup><a href="#yal.00291_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Your hand-write looks
      as clear &amp; strong as ever. I hope it really denotes that you are much better.
      The other night I read a long time in your "Specimen Days"<sup><a href="#n4121" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; got myself into a
      very melancholy state of mind thinking of the old times, of all that Washington life
       of
      O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; of that which never can come back. My life
      now seems very pale &amp; poor compared with those days. There are but two things
      now from which I derive any satisfaction, Julian<sup><a href="#loc.01151_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp;
      that bit of land up there on the river bank where I indulge my inherited love for
      the soil. I have no comrades here. I probably never shall find any more. Julian is
      developing into a very happy, intelligent boy, full of enthusiasms, full of
      curiosity, &amp; is about my only companion. He goes to school  here &amp; carries himself
      well.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am greatly distressed at what you tell me about O'Connor, and one must stand by
      powerless to render any aid! I hope I can see my way to go to W<sup><a href="#yal.00291_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> again to see
      him.
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall not stay here in P. much longer. I am getting enough of boarding house life.
      I shall go back home by March, but Mrs B<sup><a href="#n0892" id="r7">7</a></sup> &amp; Julian will stay
      here. I had a letter from Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r8">8</a></sup> this morning. The book may be
      sent to me at West Park, &amp; let me thank you in advance for it. Tell Horace the
      essays I am thinking of putting in a vol.  are old ones that have appeared in
      the magazines from time to time. What of Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r9">9</a></sup>? When you
      write again tell me what you know of his doings. Bright days here &amp; sharp, with
      ice boating in the river.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00291_n1">1. In his note, written in blue
      pencil at the top of the first page of the letter from Burroughs, Whitman is
      referring to the gift copies of his <em>Complete Poetry &amp;
         Prose </em>that he was sending to his friends (John Addington Symonds,
      Rudolf Schmidt, and Edward Carpenter).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n4121">3. The first issue of Whitman's <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em> was published by the
      Philadelphia firm of Rees Welsh and Company in 1882. The second issue was
      published by David McKay. Many of the autobiographical notes, sketches, and
      essays that focus on the poet's life during and beyond the Civil War had been
      previously published in periodicals or in <em>Memoranda During the
         War</em> (1875–1876).

      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

      September 12, 1857. The couple maintained a small farm overlooking the Hudson
      River in West Park, Ulster County. They adopted a son, Julian, at two months of
      age. It was only later revealed that John himself was the biological father of
      Julian.<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="n4267">8. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
