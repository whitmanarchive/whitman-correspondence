   <p>i write a few lines to say
      i received a letter from heyde<sup><a href="#duk.00469_n13" id="r2">2</a></sup> yesterday
      they all jeff<sup><a href="#duk.00422_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> and all set in for me to send
      the letter to you and i thought i would last
      night but to day i thought better of it
      i thought it would only put you out
      of temper as it did all of us) he first
      began with saying hanna<sup><a href="#duk.00558_n12" id="r4">4</a></sup> was so she
      came out to the kichen and eat her meals
      but she is very far from complete recovery
      she is very frail constitutionally yet
      her hand or rather her thumb by what he
      says is quite bad and the flesh scrinks 
      from the bone) this may all be true
      probably is) then he goes on to say that
      she is better off with him that any change
      would not benefit her or to that affect
      with his highfullatin  phrases) well now
      for the second act) he says
      he received
      a very stupid letter from Walt addressed
      to han<sup><a href="#duk.00558_n17" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      which he humanely concluded not
      to deliver to her and then he goes on to
      quote the first part of the letter he says
      it ran thus) i suppose my dear sister
      
      you are by this time perfectly recovered
      and the next) what a stupid man and
      the balance he says<sup><a href="#duk.00558_n14" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      is about nothing himself<sup><a href="#duk.00558_n11" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      stuff i am out of patience let him stay
      in washington  he has but small credit
      here i dont  want to see him)
   </p>
   
   <p>all this i have copied from his letter
      except where i marked above now walter
      what doo  you think such a man is
      capable of doing i hope you have or will
      write to the Doctor and if you can go
      on there i should be glad matty<sup><a href="#duk.00465_n9" id="r8">8</a></sup> says
      she makes no doubt the letter he kept
      from her was the one you spoke of her
      getting well enoughf  when you came
      that she could come back with you
      i shall write to her and i shall write
      to him he is a very bad man very very
      but Walter dont  lets think of him if han
      was away from him i should never
      want to hear his name again)

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00558_n7">1. November 28, 1868 is the
      earliest possible date for this letter, and December 12, 1868 is the latest
      possible date; the most probable date for the letter is December 5, 1868.
      The subjects of this letter are consistent with late November and early
      December 1868, both the matter of Hannah (Whitman) Heyde's serious thumb
      infection and the presence of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and his wife
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman in Brooklyn. Richard Maurice Bucke dated
      the letter to December 5, 1868, which fell on a Saturday. Edwin Haviland
      Miller accepted Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:366). December 5 is the most probable date, though the
      letter could fall a week earlier.<br><br>
      The letter very likely precedes Charles Heyde's December 8?, 1868 letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, which describes the surgical amputation of
      Hannah's thumb (Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His
         Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 225;
      Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, 2:72–73, n. 37). Walt's  letter to Samuel W. Thayer, in
      response to Hannah's  letter
      to Walt (Trent Collection), corroborates the assumption that this letter is
      unlikely to date before November 28 or after December 12 (Miller, <em>Correspondence</em>, 2:72–73, n. 37). As Louisa's
      letter seconded Hannah's request to have Walt write to Thayer in her  letter to Walt, Walt's letter
      to Hannah, which Charles Heyde intercepted, and Heyde's letter to Louisa,
      which Louisa summarized in this letter, followed in rapid succession.
      Therefore, this letter from Louisa to Walt is from early December but not
      after Hannah's surgery. It is likely also to follow Louisa's  letter to
      Walt, which offers further details about Hannah's thumb problems from
      Heyde's letter. It is possible (but unlikely) that this letter dates to the
      Saturday after Louisa's request to Walt to write Thayer (November 28), but
      it dates no later than the Saturday following Hannah's surgery (December
      12).

   <p id="duk.00469_n13">2. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a French-born landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa
      Whitman (1823–1908), Walt Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington,
      Vermont. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive
      letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman often spoke
      disparagingly of Heyde in her letters to Walt: "i had a letter or package from
      charley hay three sheets of foolscap paper and a fool wrote on them" (see her
       to Walt).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">3. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00558_n12">4. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's youngest daughter, resided
      in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles L. Heyde. The phrase "began with
      saying" that precedes Hannah's name marks the beginning of Louisa Van Velsor's
      excerpt from Charles Heyde's letter, which continues on to the next page. At the
      conclusion of her excerpt, she wrote, "all this i have copied from his letter."
      Also see note 6 below for "he says," a phrase marked in the manuscript.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00558_n17">5. Walt's late-November or
      early December letter to Hannah (Whitman) Heyde is not extant.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00558_n14">6. Above the words "he says"
      is a mark that resembles a curly brace. Because the horizontal curved mark
      intersects the curved mark after the word "next" in the line above, it may seem
      that the intent is to insert the word "he says" after the word "next" in the
      line above. However, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman explains the mark five lines
      below; she has "copied from his letter except where i marked above." This
      horizontal curved line is Louisa's mark to indicate that she is not quoting
      these two words from Charles L. Heyde's letter: they are her own words rather
      than a quotation from his letter. The mark after "next" is her usual closing
      mark for a phrase, which functions rhetorically to close a phrase but may
      resemble a closing parenthesis mark or a vertical pipe. Though the closing mark
      after "next" and the curved line enclosing "he says" intersect physically on the
      page, their function is not related.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00558_n11">7. Louisa, who was
      transcribing part of Charles Heyde's letter for Walt Whitman, appears to have
      written over a false start. After the letter "hy," the start of Heyde's name,
      she wrote over those letters with the word "himself." Heyde's letter, which she
      was transcribing, discusses Walt.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">8. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="duk.00558_n15">9. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

      Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman after throat surgery (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r9">[back]
