   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00578_n212">1. This letter dates to April
      7, 1869. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter April 7, and Richard Maurice
      Bucke assigned the year 1869. Edwin Haviland Miller also dated the letter April
      7, 1869 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). The year is correct because it
      corresponds to the appointment of a new Water Board for Brooklyn. Although the
      public announcement of the new appointees came on April 12, 1869 in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, George Washington Whitman's
      connection to Moses Lane, chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works, probably
      provided Louisa with inside information about the expected appointments some
      days earlier.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n3">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00578_n1">3. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to May 1, 1869.
      The connection between Lane and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, who had served
      under Lane before accepting the position of Chief Engineer at the St. Louis
      Water Works, led to George Washington Whitman's employment as a pipe inspector
      in Brooklyn. Lane later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and
      served there as city engineer.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00578_n5">4. John McNamee served at the
      Brooklyn Water Works in the office of Moses Lane, probably as an engineer (see
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman's  letter
      to George Washington Whitman). McNamee donated to Walt Whitman's hospital work
      (see
      "The
      Great Washington Hospitals,"
      <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, March 19, 1863, 2).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00578_n14">5. Millville, in the southern
      part of New Jersey, is on Union Lake and accessible to Delaware Bay via the
      Maurice River. The R. D. Wood Foundry had a site in Millville, but George
      Washington Whitman more often inspected pipe at Camden (see note below) and
      Florence, New Jersey. Moses Lane sent George to the Millville site to train a
      new pipe inspector. For a brief history of the company, see the Historical
      Society of Pennsylvania's finding aid to the R. D. Wood &amp; Co. Records,
      1858–1910,

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00578_n16">6. Daniel L. Northup was a
      continuing member of the Brooklyn Water Board. He had served as a city auditor.
      William A. Fowler, also continuing, was a member of the Democratic State
      Committee ("The New Water and Sewage Boards," <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Eagle</em>, April 12, 1869, 2).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00578_n17">7. The two newly appointed
      members of the Water Board were Archibald M. Bliss and Thomas Kinsella ("The New
      Water and Sewage Boards," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, April 12,
      1869, 2). The "eagle man" is Thomas Kinsella (1832–1884), a staunch
      Democrat, who served as the editor in chief of the <em>Brooklyn
         Daily Eagle</em> from 1861 until his death ("Dead. Thomas Kinsella, Editor
      of the Eagle," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, February 11, 1884,
      4). Archibald M. Bliss (1838–1923), who served on the Water Board until
      1872, was a Brooklyn alderman, delegate to the Republican National convention in
      1864 and 1868, railroad president, six-time Democratic Representative to
      Congress between 1875 and 1889, and real estate businessman in Washington, D.C.
      (<em>Biographical Directory of the United States
         Congress</em>).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00578_n15">8. Before the New York
      legislature reorganized it, the Brooklyn Water Board had operated independently
      of the Brooklyn City government. On April 1, 1869, the Water Board was
      reorganized as four appointees, two Republicans and two Democrats, all chosen by
      city officials. The activity of the Water Works, where Moses Lane was employed
      as chief engineer, was under the authority of the new Water Board, which was
      also charged with contracting for the paving and cleaning of streets ("The New
      Water and Sewage Acts," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, April 2,
      1869, 2).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n4">9. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">10. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00578_n11">11. Henry Rome was an escaped
      resident from Kings County Lunatic Asylum, where Walt Whitman had committed his
      brother Jesse Whitman. Henry was in the family of Andrew and James Rome,
      printers for the 1855 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (Robert Roper, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.01011.pdf">"Jesse Whitman, Seafarer,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 26:1 [Summer 2008],
      35–41).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n11">12. Jesse Whitman
      (1818–1870) was the first-born son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr. He suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence
      for several years before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in
      December 1864. Shortly after an outburst that followed his brother Andrew
      Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened Martha Mitchell and
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in
      some hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see Jeff's  to Walt Whitman). Louisa resisted
      institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her  letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put
      him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic
      Asylum on Flatbush Avenue, where he remained until his death on March 21, 1870
      (see E. Warner's  letter to Walt).
      For a short biography of Jesse, see Robert Roper, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.01011.pdf">"Jesse Whitman, Seafarer,"</a>

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00578_n2">13. George Washington Whitman
      started his speculative building business with a partner known only as Smith in
      1865, and they were joined by a mason named French the following year. See
      Jerome M. Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> (Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975).<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">14. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00578_n20">15. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman's early April 1869 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant.
      But Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in the same month belied Mattie's claim that
      she "is gaining": he wrote that she "is not so well for a week or so back" (see
      Jeff's  letter to Walt
      Whitman).<a href="#r15">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00578_n21">16. May 1, when leases expired,
      was moving day in Brooklyn. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman moved from 1149 Atlantic
      Avenue to 71 Portland Avenue "opposite the Arsenal" (see her  letter to Walt
      Whitman).<a href="#r16">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00578_n22">17. The 1869 <em>Brooklyn Directory</em> lists two Lotts as lawyers, Abraham and John Z., at
      13 Willoughby Street. A man named Lott is mentioned also with regard to
      financial matters concerning George Washington Whitman's speculative
      housebuilding business (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r17">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00578_n4">18. Emily "Emma" Price was the
      daughter of Edmund and Abby Price. Walt Whitman and his mother were both close
      with the Price family. For the marriage of Emily Price to Edward M. Law, an
      engraver, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt.<a href="#r18">[back]
