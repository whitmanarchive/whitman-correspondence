   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
