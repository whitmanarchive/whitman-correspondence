      <br></br><br></br>Dear girl Ruth
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your nice letter came all right, &amp; I was glad to hear from you, &amp; the news
      around there—I put in quite a busy day yesterday—in the forenoon, 9 to
      10, went to the funeral of a valued friend of mine—then had three visitors
      made long calls during the day—I was glad to see them all—one from
      Boston, I had long wanted to see—then middle of the afternoon went
      to the polls to vote, (election day here yesterday)—and went over to
      Philadelphia on a jaunt &amp; visit from 4 to 6½—But today it is raining
      &amp; blowing at a great rate, &amp; I am staying in writing,—give my love to
      your father &amp; mother—I am sorry to hear by your letter she is not very
      well—I hope you fly around &amp; spare her as much as possible in the
      work—I shall be down Friday in the 4½ afternoon train to Kirkwood if it 
      dont
      
       storm
