   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00674_n1">1. This letter dates to
      September 1862. Hannah uses similar paper in a letter to Mother Whitman dated
      September 21, 1862, by Richard Maurice Bucke: on that letter the date "21 1862"
      is in Bucke's handwriting; "from sister Han," written on the back of page 2 of
      this letter, is in Bucke's handwriting. Hannah's concerns about George are
      evident in both letters; probably Hannah wrote both letters on the same day, and
      may have enclosed her letter to her brother in the letter to Mother Whitman.
      Both letters have the same number of crease marks on them, indicating that they
      may have been placed in the same envelope. Her letter to Walt, however, does not
      have the jagged edge that her letter to Mother Whitman possesses; Hannah may
      have cut the edge off the letter to Walt.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00674_n2">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829-1901), the seventh child of Walter and Louisa Whitman, and ten years
      younger than Walt. George learned to read and write as a pupil under his older
      brother Walt (who briefly served as a schoolteacher in Long Island) and worked
      as a carpenter prior to his military service during the Civil War.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00674_n3">3. George initially enlisted in
      the Thirteenth New York State Militia soon after Fort Sumter in the spring of
      1861, and was sent to Washington, DC. When his three month enlistment was over,
      he reenlisted, this time with the Fifty-First New York Volunteers in the fall of
      1861, Company D., as Hannah notes. Hannah's concern is justified: in less than a
      month George's regiment was involved in the Second Battle of Bull Run (August
      28-30), the Battle of Chantilly (September 1), the Battle of South Mountain
      (September 14-15), and Antietam (September 17).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00674_n4">4. Charles Heyde took a
      painting tour to Ottawa, Canada (and vicinity), from August to November 1862. On
      this trip, he painted the Ottawa River, Devil's Chute Canyon, and Fitzroy
      Harbor. It is not clear whether Heyde was commissioned to paint these scenes.
