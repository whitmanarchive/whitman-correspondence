   <p>I suppose you got a letter last Saturday as well as the previous Wednesday—I am better
      than I was last week—not as well as I would like to be, but well enough to keep on
      with my work, &amp;c. just the same as ever—I feel real well, sometimes, for a day—but
      then comes the trouble in the head again—Did you get the "Galaxy" of Dec. 1st? I think
      it a very good piece. Every thing here in the office goes on as usual. I got your
      letter, mother. I wrote to Han last week. It is beautiful weather here to-day—I have
      got my new trowsers—$20!!—only think of that!—it is lucky I wear my clothes a long while—

   <p>Mother, I would rather you would use the money to get things for yourself—shoes, stockings,
      underclothes—<sup><a href="#tex.00151_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup>
