   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am sitting in my room waiting for the doctor—Mother, you are in my mind most of
      the
      time—I do hope as I write this you are feeling better—dear mother, do not get
      discouraged—there is so much in keeping good heart, (if one only can)—I think
      that is what has kept me up, &amp; is bringing me through—I think I am still on the
      gain, though it is very slow—my breakfast is brought up yet, has been this
      morning—I don't go out till about noon—then I <em>hitch</em> over
      to the office, &amp; stay there for a couple of hours—then I hitch out &amp; get in
      the cars &amp; take quite a long ride, (sometimes jolting pretty lively, as the track
      is
      bad—but I don't mind it much)—I don't eat any dinner, only a light lunch, as I
      find it is much better for me—I certainly don't get behindhand any, that's pretty
      clear, &amp; I count on time bringing me all right—the only thing I think of now is
      you, dear mother, &amp; about your getting well and strong as usual—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I got your letter yesterday (Thursday)—I suppose you got mine yesterday—I sent
      Hattie<sup><a href="#n0706" id="r2">2</a></sup> a late "Graphic,"<sup><a href="#yal.00417_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; one to Han<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      also—(the same as the last one I sent to you)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is singular how much nervous disease there is—and many cases of paralysis &amp;
      apoplexy—I think there is something in the air, for a year past, last summer,
      especially—Fortunately, it seems as if most people got over it—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Friday afternoon—1 oclock </p>
   
   
   <p>I am over at the office—Have got a letter from Sister Lou<sup><a href="#n0368" id="r5">5</a></sup> written Thursday
      morning,<sup><a href="#yal.00417_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> which gives me great relief, as it says that Sunday
      was your worst day, &amp; that you have got relief now—Dear, dear mother, I hope you
      are still getting better—you must try to feel good courage—I shall come on soon,
      probably about the 1st of June—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have got a letter from John Burroughs this morning<sup><a href="#yal.00417_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup>—he
      &amp; wife are both a little homesick, for Washington—they had got a nice home
      here—but he is going to sell it—&amp; settle up there—he does better
      there—but he was doing well enough here, &amp; was very comfortable—My head
      troubles me to-day, but I am over here at my desk, at office—Mother, if convenient
      write me a line Sunday, so I will get it Monday—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0706">2. Manahatta Whitman (1860–1886), known as
      "Hattie," was the daughter of Thomas Jefferson ("Jeff") and Martha ("Mattie")
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and sister-in-law. Hattie and her sister Jessie
      were both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="yal.00417_n1">3. "Warble for Lilac-Time" was printed in the
      <em>Graphic</em> on May 12, 1873. It had originally appeared
      in the <em>Galaxy</em> on , after Whitman sent it to William C. Church and Francis P. Church
      on .<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0285">4. Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908),
      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0368">5. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

      mother added: "dont come till you can walk good and without injury to your

   <p id="yal.00417_n4">8. About May 17, 1873, Louisa wrote: "my
      dearly beloved walter thank god i feel better this morning" (The Trent
      Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and
      Special Collections Library). But this was a false recovery. Walt Whitman
      went to Camden on May 20, 1873, and three days later his mother died. Her
       reveal her affection for her
      favorite son: "farewell my beloved sons farewell. i have lived beyond all
      comfort in this world. 
      dont
      
       mourn for me my beloved sons and daughters. farewell my dear
      beloved walter."<br><br>
      In the New York <em>Evening Post</em> on May 31, 1919, Helen E.
      Price recalled that at Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's funeral about thirty
      persons had been present. "On taking my seat among them, I noticed a curious
      thumping at intervals that made the floor vibrate beneath my feet. I was so
      absorbed in my own grief that at first I was hardly conscious of it. I
      finally left my chair, and going to the back of the room where we were
      sitting, I noticed a half-opened door leading to another room. Glancing in,
      I saw the poet all alone by the side of his mother's coffin. He was bent
      over his cane, both hands clasped upon it, and from time to time he would
      lift it and bring it down with a heavy thud on the floor. His sister-in-law
      told me that he had sat there all through the previous night."<a href="#r8">[back]
