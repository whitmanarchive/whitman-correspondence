      <br></br><br></br>My Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>A kind of anxiety has for some time past weighed upon me and upon others, I find,
      who
      love &amp; admire you, that you do not have all the comforts you ought to have; that
      you are perhaps sometimes straightened for means. We have had letters from several
      young men, almost or quite strangers to us, asking questions on this subject; and
      we
      hoped &amp; thought that if this were so, you would permit those who have received
      such priceless gifts from you to put their gratitude into some tangible shape, some
      "free-will offering." Hence the paragraph was put into the <em>Athenaeum</em> which I send with this,<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> and we were
      proceeding to organize our forces when your paper came to hand this morning (the <em>Camden Post</em>, July 3), which seems decisively to bid us
      desist. Or at all events wait till we had told you of our wishes and plan. One thing
      would, I feel sure, give you pleasure in any case; and that is to know that there
      is
      over here a little band—perhaps indeed it is now quite a considerable one, for
      we had not yet had time to ascertain how considerable—who would joyfully
      respond to that Poem of yours, "To Rich Givers." 
   </p>
   
   <p>A friend and near neighbour of ours, Frederick Wedmore,<sup><a href="#loc.02188_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> is coming over to America
      this autumn, and counts much on coming to see you. He is a well-known writer on Art
      here—a friendly, candid, open-minded man with whom, I think, you will enjoy a
      talk.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am on the lookout for Miss Smith<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>—shall indeed
      enjoy a talk with a special friend of yours, dear Walt. I hope she will not fail to
      come. Giddy<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r4">4</a></sup> is away at Haslemere. Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      just going to write for himself to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>That is a very graphic bit in the <em>Post</em>—the portrait of
      Hugo, the canary &amp; the kitten<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup>—I like to know
      all that—as well as to hear the talk.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05908_n2">1. The paragraph in the <em>Athenaeum</em> of July 11, 1885, read: "A subscription list is
      being formed in England with a view to presenting a free-will offering to the
      American poet Walt Whitman. The poet is in his sixty-seventh year, and has since
      his enforced retirement some years ago from official work in Washington, owing
      to an attack of paralysis, maintained himself precariously by the sale of his
      works in poetry and prose, and by occasional contributions to magazines." The
      magazine lists Anne Gilchrist's son Herbert as well as William Rossetti as the
      parties responsible for the collection. In mid-August of that year, the <em>Athenaeum</em> printed Whitman's letter to Herbert Gilchrist
      of , in which Whitman said he
      "should decidedly and gratefully accept anything" sent as an offering.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02188_n1">2. Frederick Wedmore
      (1844–1921) was a theater critic and scholar from England. He was also a
      neighbor of the Gilchrists. Whether he really met Whitman that fall (as was
      planned) is unclear.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05908_n1">3. Alys Smith
      (1867–1951) was a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith and eventually married
      the philosopher Bertrand Russell.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0890">4. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">5. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="loc.05908_n3">6. This is likely a reference
      to William Hosen Ballou's interview with Whitman that appeared in the Camden <em>Daily Post</em> on June 28, 1885, and was reprinted in the <em>Cleveland Leader and Herald</em>. In the piece, the
      interviewer also described Whitman's room, describing "a small picture of Victor
      Hugo, framed and bordered with mourning," Whitman's "old fashioned" furniture
      and a "canary" that "sang with all his might, and a kitten [that] played to and
      fro."<a href="#r6">[back]
