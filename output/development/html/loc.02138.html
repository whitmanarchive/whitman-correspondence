   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Hamlin Garland
      (1860–1940) was an American novelist and autobiographer, known especially
      for his works about the hardships of farm life in the American Midwest. For his
      relationship to Whitman, see Thomas K. Dean, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_190.html">Garland, Hamlin</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02138_n1">1. This letter is
      addressed: Walt Whitman | Mickle st | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked:
      Philadelphia, PA | Oct | [illegible]| 8am; 
      Camden, NJ | Oct 20 | 6am | 1889 | Rec'd. Garland's return address is printed on the
      envelope
      as follows: HAMLIN GARLAND | Teacher English &amp; American Literature, Shakespeare, |
      Dramatic Reading, etc. Rooms at No. 7 Beacon St. | BOSTON SCHOOL OF ORATORY.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02138_n3">2. Garland sent the poet
      "Whitman at Seventy" in typescript (Hamlin Garland Papers, University of Souther California).
      The essay was
      published in the <em>New York Herald</em>, June 30, 1889. As he tended to do, Whitman revised Garland's essay.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03027_n4">3. For Whitman's seventieth
      birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
      the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
      (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.30.html">Tuesday, May 7, 1889</a>. The day was celebrated with a testimonial
      dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
      addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
      arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4980">5. C. Sadakichi Hartmann (ca.
      1867–1944) was an art historian and early critic of photography as an art
      form. He visited Whitman in Camden in the 1880s and published his conversations
      with the poet in 1895. Generally unpopular with other supporters of the poet, he
      was known during his years in Greenwich Village as the "King of Bohemia." For
      more information about Hartmann, see John F. Roche, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_113.html">Hartmann, C. Sadakichi (ca. 1867–1944)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4317">6. William Dean Howells
      (1837–1920) was an American realist novelist and literary critic, serving
      the staff of the <em>New York Nation</em> and <em>Harper's Magazine</em> during the mid 1860s. During his tenure as
      editor-in-chief of <em> The Atlantic Monthly</em> from 1871 to
      1880, he was one of the foremost critics in New York, and used his influence to
      support American authors like Hamlin Garland, Stephen Crane, and Emily
      Dickinson. He also brought attention to European authors like Henrik Ibsen,
      Giovanni Verga, and Leo Tolstoy in particular. Howells was highly skeptical of
      Whitman's poetry, however, and frequently questioned his literary merit. In an
      Ashtabula <em> Sentinel </em>review of the 1860 edition <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, Howells wrote, "If he is indeed 'the
      distinctive poet of America,' then the office of poet is one which must be left
      hereafter to the shameless and the friendless. for WALT WHITMAN is not a man
      whom you would like to know." In 1865, Howells would write the first important
      review of <em> Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Round
         Table</em>, demonstrating early signs of his conflicted opinion about
      Whitman. For more information on Howells, see Goodman, Susan &amp; Dawson, Carl,
      <em>William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life</em> (Berkeley:
      University of California Press, 2005).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n6000">7. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="loc.02132_n3">9. Edward Henry Clement
      (1843–1920) of Chelsea, Massachusetts, began his career as a journalist
      with the <em>Savannah Daily News</em> in the mid-1860s. He later
      became the editor of the <em>Boston Transcript</em>, a position
      that he held for twenty-five years.<a href="#r9">[back]
