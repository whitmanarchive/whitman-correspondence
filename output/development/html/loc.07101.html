   </p>   
   
   <p>I enclose for the cottage<sup><a href="#n4116" id="r2">2</a></sup> $285 in two checks of $50 and $235 respectively. On the
      former you will see the signature of one of the best of your Boston friends, Dr.
      Wesselhoeft.<sup><a href="#n3142" id="r3">3</a></sup> This will make $788 so far, I believe,
      and I think the remaining $12 will be forthcoming soon.
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish it might have been done so as to enable you to escape this hot weather
      altogether, but I hope
      you can contrive to get away before the summer ends. Shall you get some house that
      is already built, or do you propose building?
   </p>
   
   <p>Would you not like in the house a nice fireplace where you can sit and toast your
      toes before a nice open fire and dream with open eyes as you look at the blaze? I
      think you would enjoy that better than an ugly black stove that scorches all the
      vitality out of the air. If the idea pleases you, my friend, Jack Law, the Chelsea tile-maker,
      would like to send you a handsome set of tiles for it. Law knew you in the old Pfaff
      days,<sup><a href="#n3141" id="r4">4</a></sup> when he was a landscape painter, but says you
      probably would not recollect him by name. Very likely you might remember his
      vigorous expletives, and great enthusiasm!
   </p>
   
   <p>I think I may go on to New York next week and run over to Philadelphia when I
      shall drop in on
      you.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer"> 
      Faithfully yours,
      <br></br>Sylvester Baxter.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>P.S.—Oh! About Hartmann.<sup><a href="#n4980" id="r5">5</a></sup> He was altogether "too
      previous" and hardly appreciated what he had undertaken. He did not know how to
      go to work and appointed officers of a society which had not been organized! We
      all had to sit down on him and the matter is in abeyance. I hope it may come to
      something later. You may remember I wrote you last winter about the idea of a W.
      W. Society.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07101_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle St. | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked Boston.
      Mass. | 7.45 P | Aug 2 | 1887; Camden. N[illegible] | Aug | 3 | 1887 | Rec'd. The recto of this envelope contains
      a stamp that reads "The Herald 255, Washington Street, Boston."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4116">2. William Sloane Kennedy had proposed
      the idea of building the poet a "summer 'shanty'" on the farm land owned by
      George and Susan Stafford (parents of Whitman's young friend Harry Stafford), a
      place Whitman often visited in the summer. Sylvester Baxter took charge of
      raising money for this Cottage Fund project in and around Boston. See William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> (1896),
      10–11.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3142">3. William P. Wesselhoeft
      (1835–1909) was a homeopathic doctor from Pennsylvania and the son of the
      famous William Wilhelm Wesselhoeft, one of the most prominent proponents of
      Hahnemannian medicine in the United States.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3141">4. Pfaff's was a well-known Manhattan
      beer cellar (located at 647 Broadway) that Whitman frequented in the late 1850s
      and the early 1860s. The bar was the preferred gathering place of New York
      Bohemia before the Civil War.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4980">5. C. Sadakichi Hartmann (ca.
      1867–1944) was an art historian and early critic of photography as an art
      form. He visited Whitman in Camden in the 1880s and published his conversations
      with the poet in 1895. Generally unpopular with other supporters of the poet, he
      was known during his years in Greenwich Village as the "King of Bohemia." For
      more information about Hartmann, see John F. Roche, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_113.html">Hartmann, C. Sadakichi (ca. 1867–1944)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
