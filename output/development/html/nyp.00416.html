      <br></br><br></br>Dear Hank
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just written a postal to your folks to say I wouldn't be down till Saturday
      afternoon (Ashland Station) &amp; I thought I would write you a line—Every thing goes
      well with me these times considering—health &amp; feelings better since I come back from
      Canada than for nine years past—(one of the ferry men told me he heard a lady say
      to another on the boat yesterday as I went off, "He looks older &amp; savager than ever,
      dont he? but there is a something—I dont wonder that Aleck is all taken up with him"
      &amp;c &amp;c—<em>Aleck</em>, the ferry man thought, was her husband)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am selling quite a good many of my books now<sup><a href="#nyp.00416_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—gives me something to do every day—so you see I have enough to put me in quite a
      good humor. Then upon going to look where I had my bound books boxed &amp; stored away,
      up in the garret at Mr. Scovel's, (I hadn't been to look after them in three years)—I
      found them not only in good condition but found I had twice as many as I calculated—yesterday
      I had the express man to bring two boxes of 'em home, &amp; left three boxes there still.
      I got a letter from the PM General, Canada<sup><a href="#nyp.00416_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—the missing letter not there—I am convinced it came to Haddonfield—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>2.40 afternoon</p>
   
   
   <p>I have just had my dinner &amp; am up here in my third story room finishing this—it is
      a bright sunny day here, after the three days' storm—I have been alone all day, but
      busy &amp; contented—my room is just right for all the year except the very hottest months—the
      sun pours in here so nice, especially afternoons—I wish you was here to-day, Hank
      (I havn't got any <em>wine</em> though)—I see Hoag<sup><a href="#nyp.00416_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> yesterday, &amp; Seigfried too—every body is flying around—Election excitement now, very
      hot. Sports, newspaper men, &amp; politicians busy as the devil in a gale of wind—Love
      to you, dear son—I shall be down Saturday<sup><a href="#nyp.00416_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
