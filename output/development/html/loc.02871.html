      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The paper has just been forwarded here which tells me you are still suffering, and
      not, as I was fondly believing, already quite emerged from the cloud of sickness.
      My
      Darling—let me use that tender caressing word once more, for how can I help
      it, with heart so full &amp; no outlet but words?  My darling. I say it over &amp; over to
      myself with voice with eyes so full of love, of tender yearning sorrowful longing
      love. I would give all the world if I might come (but am held here yet awhile
      inexorably by a duty nothing may supersede) &amp; soothe &amp; tend &amp; wait on
      you &amp; with cheerful loving companionship lift off some of the weight of the long
      hours &amp; days &amp; perhaps months that must still go over while nature slowly,
      imperceptibly  but
      still so surely repairing the mischief within, result of the tremendous ordeal to
      your frame of those great overbrimming years of life spent in the Army Hospitals.
      You see dear Friend a woman who is a mother has thenceforth something of that
      feeling toward all men who are dear to her—a cherishing fostering instinct
      that makes her rejoice so in all personal service to them.
      &amp; I should be
      so happy it needs must diffuse a reviving  comforting vivifying warmth around you.
      Might but these words breathed out of the inmost heart of a woman who loves you with
      her whole soul &amp; life &amp; strength fulfil their errand &amp; comfort the
      sorrowful heart, if ever so little—and through that help to revive the
      drooping frame! This love that has grown up far away over here, unhelped by the
      sweet influences of personal intercourse, penetrating the whole substance of a  woman's life,
      swallowing up into itself all her aspirations, hopes, longings, regardless of Death,
      looking earnestly confidently beyond that for fruition blending more or less with
      every thought &amp; act of her life a guiding star that her feet cannot choose but
      follow resolutely—what can be more real than this dear Friend. What can have
      deeper roots, or a more immortal growing power within it? But I do not  ask any longer whether
      this love is believed in &amp; welcome &amp; precious to you. For I know that what
      has real roots cannot fail to bear real flowers and fruits that will in the end be
      sweet and joygiving to you; and that if I am indeed capable of being your eternal
      comrade, climbing whereon you climb, daring all that you dare, learning all that you
      learn, suffering all that you suffer (pressing  closest then) enjoying all that you
      enjoy, you will want me, will not be able to help stretching out your hand &amp;
      drawing me to you. I have written this mostly out in the fields as I am so fond of
      doing—the serene beautiful harvest landscape spread around; returned once
      more, as I have every summer for five &amp; twenty years, to this old village where
      my mother's family have lived in unbroken succession three hundred years, ever since
      in fact, the old Priory they  have inhabited ceased to be a Priory at the dissolution of
      monasteries—My Mother's health is still good—wonderful, indeed, for 88
      though she has been 30 years crippled by rheumatism. Still she enjoys getting out
      in
      the Sunshine in her Bath chair &amp; is able to take pleasure in seeing her friends
      &amp; in having us all with her. Her father was a hale man at 90.—These
      eastern counties are flat &amp; tame but yet under this soft smiling summer sky
      lovely enough too—with  their rich delicious green meadows abundant golden corn crops now
      being well got in &amp; thickly scattered old homesteads each with gay garden, &amp;
      picturesque villages shaded by tall elms. Even the sluggish little river Colne one
      cannot find fault with, it nourishes such a luxuriant border of wild flowers as it
      creeps along, &amp; turns &amp; twists about from sunshine into shade &amp; from
      shade into sunshine so as to make the very best &amp; most  of itself. But as to the human growth
      here, I think that perhaps more than anywhere else in England it struggles along
      choked &amp; poisoned by dead things of the past still holding their place above
      ground.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I did not see William Rossetti before I came
      down but heard he had had a very happy time in Italy &amp; splendid weather all the
      while. Mr. Conway &amp; his wife &amp; three children  are gone to Brittany
      for their holiday.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My boys &amp; girls are well—except indeed that I am afraid Percy finds his
      health somewhat affected by the constant inhaling of unwholesome gases analyzing
      ores all day long, but he is going to have better appliances in his laboratory which
      will I hope remove or lessen very much the evil. In other respects he likes his work
      &amp; is getting good experience
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>May this find you by the sea shore—getting on so fast,—the friend you
      love best with you, comforted, refreshed soul and body—perfect harmony between
      these two restored once more [
      <span class="unclear">so?</span>]
       that you step forth with strong &amp; buoyant step to complete
      your great purpose.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
