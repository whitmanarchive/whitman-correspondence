   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00317_n2">1. See Whitman's letter
      from <br><br>Henry Stanbery
      (1803–1881) was appointed Attorney General on July 23, 1866, and
      served until March 12, 1868, when he resigned to serve as President
      Johnson's chief counsel in the impeachment proceedings. When, at the
      conclusion of the trial, Johnson renominated Stanbery, the Senate refused to
      confirm him. Failing eyesight—to which Whitman referred in letters from ,
      and ,—forced
      Stanbery to retire from legal practice in 1878. Speaking to Horace Traubel
      in 1888, Whitman affirmed his fondness for Stanbery (<em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Company,
      1906–1996], 3:156).
