      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We hav'nt heard from you for some time<sup><a href="#loc.00442_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—you say the bundle was not the right one—I read the label and thought it read the
      same as you described in your letter—would you like me to send the other or right
      one if I can find it—Mother told me she knew the one you meant and that she would
      put it on the table for me<sup><a href="#loc.00442_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—that is the one I sent
   </p>
   
   <p>We had a letter from Mother to-day—she seems pretty well—talks a little of coming
      home but does not say when—I have just written her this eve—We are all as well as
      usual—the baby has a bad boil on its forehead but I suppose it will get well in a
      day or two and then she will be all right again—it looks just now though about as
      bad as anything of the kind I ever saw &nbsp;by-the-way it was me that had the "run around"
      on the finger<sup><a href="#loc.00442_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—and I have just got well of it—and a cussed bad time I had of it too—it accounts for my not writing you before—
   </p>
   
   <p>George is getting along first rate I guess—He dont say any more about getting a position in the Custom House—I hope he wont try but
      I am quite sure that if he can keep devoted to his present undertaking he will make
      a handsome fortune in 8 or ten years<sup><a href="#loc.00442_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—he certainly has the prospect of it—there is an immense amount of building in the
      city this season—though material is wonderful high—brick $12 per thousand—should be
      abt 5 or 6—I have given up all thought of building this fall—at one time I thought I
      would sure &nbsp;perhaps next spring will be better
   </p>
   
   <p>Matters about Brooklyn are much the same—with me just the same—Mr Kirkwood<sup><a href="#loc.00442_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> has been on a visit to Brooklyn and just gone back to St. Louis—I think it more than
      likely that he will build the water works of that city—if so it will be as large a
      job as the Brooklyn works
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The Doctor<sup><a href="#loc.00442_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> returned from the country last week—he looks first rate—says he had a wonderfully
      good time—he was spending the summer up in Vermont near Burlington—speaks of it as
      being a splendid place to live—
   </p>
   
   <p>In her letter to-day Mother says she wants either you or George to come on and come
      home with her<sup><a href="#loc.00442_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—so I suppose she begins to think of coming home
   </p>
   
   <p>Mattie and the children desire to send their love to you—the child[ren] are growing
      first rate—
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish you would write me &nbsp;I want to know how things are going with you</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00442_n1">1. Whitman's most recent
      letter to the family had been written on about September 20 (Edwin Haviland
      Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 1:369).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00442_n2">2. In her letter to Walt
      Whitman of September 5, 1865, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman seemed confident that
      she knew which bundle the poet wanted: "if you want Jeff to send that package of
      papers you must write to him" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University
      Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). It is not clear what
      material Whitman was seeking.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00442_n3">3. Jeff's failure to
      include a period after "says" in his letter to Walt from  created ambiguity. The poet must have understood
      Jeff's letter to mean that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had the "run around" on her
      finger.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00442_n4">4. Jeff was right in
      thinking that George would eventually prosper. At his death in 1901 George left
      an estate valued at $59,348.14. No one has discovered how he accumulated so much
      money (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975], 33).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00442_n5">5. See Jeff's letter to
      Walt from . Kirkwood had been
      appointed chief engineer of the proposed new St. Louis Water Works on April 22,
      1865.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00442_n6">6. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–67) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his
      practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems"
      (Miller, <em>Correspondence</em>, 1:90, n.85). While near
      Burlington, he may have visited Charles and Hannah Heyde.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00442_n7">7. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was especially interested in having Walt come to get her because she and
      Hannah hoped he would buy a place in Birmingham near Burlington, Vermont (Gay
      Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of
         Walt Whitman</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955; rev. ed., New York University
      Press, 1967], 352–53).<a href="#r7">[back]
