   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Samuel Sidney McClure
      (1857–1949) was the co-founder and editor of <em>McClure's
         Magazine</em>. Well-known for its investigative journalism, the illustrated
      monthly initially rejected Whitman's submissions and only posthumously published
      some of his poetry (in 1897).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00809_n1">1. After McClure refused
      "Shakspere-Bacon's Cipher," Whitman sent it on September 6 to Henry Alden, of
      <em>Harper's New Monthly Magazine</em>, who also rejected it.
      On September 13 it was submitted to <em>The Cosmopolitan</em>,
      which paid $20 and printed it in October (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
