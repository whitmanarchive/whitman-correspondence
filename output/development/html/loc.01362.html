   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      addressed: Mrs: Costelloe | 40 Grosvenor Road | the Embankment | London England.

   <p id="loc.01362_n2">2. On , Mary Costelloe had written: "Thee
      can't think what a refreshment to soul and body it is to read 'Leaves of Grass'
      or even to think of thee, in the midst of this artificial town life."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.01362_n4">5. On February 23, 1887 the
      Philadelphia <em>Press</em> reported that on the preceding evening
      "the venerable poet spoke at length concerning his poetry, and in the course of
      his address repeated extracts, among which were 'The Mysterious Trumpeter' and
      'Two Birds' in 'Pauman Oak'" ["The Mystic Trumpeter" and the section beginning
      "Once Paumanok . . ." from "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking"]. The meeting
      was attended by Traubel and Dr. Daniel G. Brinton, a professor at the University
      of Pennsylvania, who on  formally
      conveyed to Walt Whitman the gratitude of the club. According to Whitman's
      Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.), he received $20 for the
      reading. See Traubel's account in <em>In Re Walt Whitman</em>
      (1893), ed. by Horace L. Traubel, Richard Maurice Bucke, and Thomas B. Harned,
      130-131.<a href="#r5">[back]
