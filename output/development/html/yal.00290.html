      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I recd your card yesterday, &amp; also the English paper.<sup><a href="#yal.00290_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> This morning Doctor Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> sends me
      Williams<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r3">3</a></sup> letter. It makes me groan in spirit to think of Williams condition. But
      he evidently 
      exagerates 
        
       it somewhat, 
      for this letter shows streaks of the old fire.<sup><a href="#yal.00290_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> 'Tis a pity he sits down &amp; lets this thing
      creep over him. He could do much to fight it off, or keep it at bay, if he would make the
      effort you have made, or if he would take a sea voyage. I think I must go to W. this
      winter &amp; see him. I have some notion of going south to get a glimpse of the
      tropics.
   </p>
   
   <p>I like your Lippincott paper;<sup><a href="#yal.00290_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> it is very dignified &amp;
      impressive, &amp; contains many very effective sentences. I am so glad you are
      writing again. My own health is pretty good. I think I have been much benefited  the past fall by
      drinking vichy water. It has reduced my weight about 10 per cent. My belly has gone
      away as if I had been confined. It might be good for you. It is good for those who
      make too much blood &amp; fat. It reduces &amp; thins the blood, &amp;, with me, it
      corrects the too much uric acid. I am eating but two meals a day, the last at 
      2 1/2 p.m.
       
       I sleep much better for it.
   </p>
   
   <p>The Quarterly Review article to which O'C. refers I have read.<sup><a href="#yal.00290_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> It is very fine, many strong &amp; penetrating things
      said about you. I should like to know who wrote it. It is in the same number that
      poor Gosse<sup><a href="#n0273" id="r7">7</a></sup> gets such a terrible cutting up. The New Zealanders
      book I had not heard of.<sup><a href="#loc.03321_n1" id="r8">8</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Your book will doubtless have a checkered career in the future as it has had in the
      past, but I have no more doubt that it is one of the few immortal books than I have
      of my own existence. The world can never long pass it by. If it suffers centuries
      of
      eclipse &amp; neglect it is bound to come up again.
   </p>
   
   <p>Study into the causes of your bad spells &amp; I believe you may master them, or
      mitigate them. The bowells are the seat of the difficulty with you, I believe. Dr
      Bucke says he is well, &amp; lecturing on insanity to medical students.<sup><a href="#yal.00290_n5" id="r9">9</a></sup> I enclose O'C.'s letter.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="yal.00290_n1">1. Burroughs is referring to
      Whitman's letter of . It is
      unclear what paper Burroughs refers to.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">3. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00290_n2">4. Burroughs is probably
      referring to William D. O'Connor's letter to Whitman of , which the poet apparently forwarded. In the
      letter, O'Connor laments: "The difficulty of managing pen and ink is
      indescribable, and only equalled by the difficulty of putting even the simplest
      expressions together. I begin to fear that paralysis is not far off. I move
      about with slowness and difficulty. But worst of all is the horrible deadness of
      the mind. I put in an appearance every day at the office, but it is a long time
      since I have been able to do anything."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00290_n3">5. Burroughs is referring to
      "My Book and I," which appeared in the December edition of the magazine.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00290_n4">6. "American Poets," in the
      October number of the <em>British Quarterly Review</em>. O'Connor
      describes it as "disfigured by a few lines, but as a whole it is a glorious
      tribute, and full of splendid and wholehearted ardor."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0273">7. Sir Edmund William Gosse (1849–1928), English
      poet and author of <em>Father and Son</em> (a memoir published in
      1907), had written to Whitman on : "I can but thank you for all that I have learned from you, all the
      beauty you have taught me to see in the common life of healthy men and women,
      and all the pleasure there is in the mere humanity of other people" (see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.65.html">Friday, June 1, 1888</a>). Gosse reviewed <em>Two
         Rivulets</em> in "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/rivulets/anc.00075.html">Walt Whitman's New Book</a>," <em>The Academy</em>, 9 (24
      June 1876), 602–603, and visited Whitman in 1885 (see Whitman's letter
      inviting Gosse to visit on  and
      <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–1977], 3:384 n80). In a letter to
      Richard Maurice Bucke on , Whitman
      characterized Gosse as "one of the amiable conventional wall-flowers of
      literature" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). For more about Gosse, see Jerry F.
      King, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_112.html">Gosse, Sir Edmund (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03321_n1">8. It is unclear what books
      O'Connor included with his letter, but one appears to be "the New Zealand
      professor's book" that O'Connor described in his letter to Whitman of <a href="syr.00028.html">December 10, 1886</a>. The "professor" is likely
      John Macmillan Brown (1845–1935) of New Zealand's Canterbury College, who
      visited Whitman in 1884. It is unclear what the title of the publication is but
      it was apparently reviewed in London's <em>The Nation</em> in the
      early 1880s.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00290_n5">9. Discussing the letter with
      Horace Traubel, Whitman responded: "John was then, is now, about right in saying
      the bowels are the seat of the difficulty, but he was, he is wrong, if he says
      the bowels are the origin of the difficulty. There's something back of all that
      in my history, physiology, accounting for the hole I've got myself into. I have
      lived along pretty conservative lines now for years, but in spite of that I'm
      slowly slipping to the foot of the hill: it seems as though nothing would stay,
      however some things might or do delay, my descent" (<em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.22.html">Monday, February 11, 1889</a>).<a href="#r9">[back]
