   <p>Thanks, my dear friend, for your cheery letter, &amp; for your warm &amp; hospitable invitations—I
      am though crippled 
      as ever perhaps <u>decidedly better</u> this winter—certainly in the way of strength &amp; general vim—&amp; it would be 
      very pleasant to me to come on &amp; stay at your house for about a week, if perfectly
      convenient, &amp; if you have 
      plenty of room—My (adopted) son,<sup><a href="#loc.02552_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> a young man of 18, is with me now, sees to me, &amp; occasionally transacts 
      my business affairs, &amp; I feel somewhat at sea without him—Could I bring him with 
      
      
      
      me, to share my room, 
      &amp; your hospitality &amp; be with me?—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Glad to hear in your note from Joaquin Miller—first news of him now for three months—Will
      sit to Mr Waters with great pleasure<sup><a href="#loc.02552_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>&gt;—&amp; he &amp; you shall have every thing your own way—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I am selling a few copies of my Vols, new Edition, from time to time—most of them
      go to the British Islands——I see Mr Loag<sup><a href="#loc.02552_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> occasionally—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
