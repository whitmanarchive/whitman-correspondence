   <p>My note of yesterday, (or day before,) <em>asking for the bill</em> was
      written in the midst of a splitting headache—&amp; without fully reading yours.

   <p>To-day, better, I have just taken up yours to read a second time, (as I generally
      do with
      my friends' letters,) &amp; see your kind &amp; friendly gift to me of the prints<sup><a href="#yal.00420_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—which I accept with thanks &amp; pleasure. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Two days now of fine weather—which I fancy is telling on me, as well as on the frozen
      ground &amp; sap in the trees—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0360">1. William James Linton (1812–1897), British-born
      wood engraver, came to the U. S. in 1867 and settled near New Haven, Conn. He
      illustrated the works of Whittier, Longfellow, Bryant, and others, wrote the
      "indispensable" <em>History of Wood-Engraving in America</em>
      (1882), and edited <em>Poetry of America, 1776–1876</em>
      (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Walt Whitman's poems as well as his
      picture. Linton's engraving of Walt Whitman appeared in the 1876 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, in <em>Complete Poems
         &amp; Prose</em> (1888–1889), and in <em>The Complete
         Writings of Walt Whitman</em> (1902), 10 vols., II, 156; it inspired the
      poem "Out from Behind This Mask." See Harold Blodgett, "Whitman and the Linton
      Portrait," <em>Walt Whitman Newsletter</em>, IV (1958),
      90–92. According to his <em>Threescore and Ten Years, 1820
         to 1890—Recollections</em> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Walt
      Whitman in Washington and later visited him in Camden, which Whitman reported in
      his , letter to Peter Doyle: "I
      liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, ... a true poet
      who could not write poetry, much of wilfulness accounting for his neglect of
      form." His obituary in the New York <em>Times</em> of January 8,
      1898, called Linton "the greatest wood engraver of his time, an artist in other
      senses, and a poet of no mean ability."<a href="#r1">[back]
