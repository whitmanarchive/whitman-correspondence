      <br></br><br></br>My dear R B
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I sent you over two months ago (Sept 5),<sup><a href="#loc.02844_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> by express prepaid direct to same address as this letter, a package of some 17 or
      18 vols 
      of my books, in wrappers, with names on them. As up to this date I have heard nothing
      of them from you, 
      and Messrs. Strahan have not acknowledged them either, I am a little uneasy about
      them. Have they arrived?
      Have they been distributed?<sup><a href="#loc.02844_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am jogging along much the same. My limbs still lamed from paralysis—but I get around
      yet—strength a little more reliable—spirits cheerful.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letters of April 18 and 28th were very comforting to me. I have read them several
      times—&amp; they are before me now.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wrote to you Sept. 4, announcing the Vols. That was my last. Did it reach you? Your
      letter of April 28th is the last I have rec'd from you.
      
   </p>

   <p id="loc.02844_n3">3. On January 8, 1877,
      Buchanan informed Walt Whitman that he had neglected acknowledge the books
      because "the tone adopted by certain of your friends here became so unpleasant
      that I requested all subscriptions etc. to be paid over to William Michael
      Rossetti, and received no more myself" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.;
