      <br></br>Washington,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Monday forenoon, | December 29, 1862.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear, dear Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Friday the 19th inst. I succeeded in reaching the camp of the 51st New York, and found
      George alive and well—In order to make sure that you would get the good news, I sent
      back by messenger to Washington (I dare say you did not get it for some time) a telegraphic
      dispatch, as well as a letter—and the same to Hannah at Burlington. I have staid in
      camp with George ever since, till yesterday, when I came back to Washington<sup><a href="#loc.00758_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—about the 24th George got Jeff's letter of the 20th. Mother, how much you must have
      suffered, all that week, till George's letter came—and all the rest must too. As to
      me, I know I put in about three days of the greatest suffering I ever experienced
      in my life. I wrote to Jeff<sup><a href="#loc.00758_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> how I had my pocket picked in a jam and hurry, changing cars, at Philadelphia, so that I landed here without
      a dime. The next two days I spent hunting through the hospitals, walking all day and
      night, unable to ride, trying to get information, trying to get access to big people,
      &amp;c—I could not get the least clue to anything—Odell<sup><a href="#loc.00758_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> would not see me at all—But Thursday afternoon, I lit on a way to get down on the
      government boat that runs to Aquia creek, and so by railroad to the neighborhood of
      Falmouth, opposite Fredericksburgh—So by degrees I worked my way to Ferrero's<sup><a href="#loc.00758_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> brigade, which I found Friday afternoon without much trouble after I got in camp.
      When I found dear brother George, and found that he was alive and well, O you may
      imagine how trifling all my little cares and difficulties seemed—they vanished into
      nothing. And now that I have lived for eight or nine days amid such scenes as the
      camps furnish, and had a practical part in it all, and realize the way that hundreds
      of thousands of good men are now living, and have had to live for a year or more,
      not only without any of the comforts, but with death and sickness and hard marching
      and hard fighting, (and no success at that,) for their continual experience—really
      nothing we call trouble seems worth talking about. One of the first things that met
      my eyes in camp, was a heap of feet, arms, legs, &amp;c. under a tree in front a hospital,
      the Lacy house.
   </p>
   
   <p>George is very well in health, has a good appetite—I think he is at times more wearied
      out and homesick than he shows, but stands it upon the whole very well. Every one
      of the soldiers, to a man, wants to get home.
   </p>
   
   <p>I suppose Jeff got quite a long letter I wrote from camp, about a week ago. I told
      you that George had been promoted to Captain<sup><a href="#loc.00758_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—his commission arrived while I was there. When you write, address
   </p>
   
   <p>Capt. George W. Whitman 
      Co. K. 51st New York Vol.
      Ferrero's brigade 
      near Falmouth Va.
   </p>
   
   <p>Jeff must write oftener, and put in a few lines from mother, even if it is only two
      lines—then in the next letter a few lines from Mat, and so on. You have no idea how
      letters from home cheer one up in camp, and dissipate home sickness.
   </p>
    
   
   <p>While I was there George still lived in Capt. Francis's<sup><a href="#loc.00758_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> tent—there were five of us altogether, to eat, sleep, write, &amp;c. in a space twelve
      feet square, but we got along very well—the weather all along was very fine—and would
      have got along to perfection, but Capt. Francis is not a man I could like much—I had
      very little to say to him. George is about building a place, half-hut and half-tent,
      for himself—(he is probably about it this very day)—and then he will be better off,
      I think. Every Captain has a tent, in which he lives, transacts company business,
      &amp;c. has a cook, (or man of all work,) and in the same tent mess and sleep his Lieutenants,
      and perhaps the 1st sergeant. They have a kind of fire-place, and the cook's fire
      is outside, on the open ground. George had very good times while Francis was away—the
      cook, a young disabled soldier, Tom,<sup><a href="#loc.00758_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> is an excellent fellow, and a first-rate cook, and the 2d Lieutenant, Pooley,<sup><a href="#loc.00758_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> is a tip-top young Pennsylvanian. Tom thinks all the world of George—when he heard
      he was wounded, on the day of the battle, he left every thing, got across the river,
      and went hunting for George through the field, through thick and thin. I wrote to
      Jeff that George was wounded by a shell, a gash in the cheek—you could stick a splint
      through into the mouth, but it has healed up without difficulty already. Every thing
      is uncertain about the army, whether it moves or stays where it is. There are no furloughs
      granted at present. I will stay here for the present, at any rate long enough to see
      if I can get any employment at any thing, and shall write what luck I have. Of course
      I am unsettled at present. Dear mother, my love,
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>If Jeff or any one writes, address me, | care of Major Hapgood,9 paymaster, U. S.
      Army, | corner 15th and F streets, 5th floor, | Washington D. C. I send my love to
      dear sister Mat, and little sis—and to Andrew and all my brothers. O Mat, how lucky
      it was you did not come—together, we could never have got down to see George.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00758_n1">1. The Whitman family
      evidently became alarmed about George during the second battle of Bull Run when
      they noticed in the <em>New York Herald</em> of December 16, 1862,
      that "First Lieutenant G. W. Whitmore" was listed among the wounded; see Gay
      Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of
         Walt Whitman</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1955; rev. ed., New York University
      Press, 1967), 281. Moses Lane (see Whitman's letter from ) on the same day asked Captain James J. Dana to
      obtain a pass for Walt Whitman so that he might visit George at Falmouth; on the
      following day Dana wrote to the Provost Marshal, Colonel W. E. Doster. (Both
      letters are in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.) After he lost his money in
      Philadelphia, Walt Whitman managed to go on to Washington, where he tried to
      locate George in the military hospitals. He encountered two men whom he had met
      in Boston in 1860: William D. O'Connor lent him money, and Eldridge obtained a
      pass for him to Fredericksburg. Meanwhile, not having heard from Walt Whitman,
      Jeff wrote anxiously on : "We are
      all much worried at not hearing anything from you. . . . The Times of day before
      yesterday gave his name among the wounded thus 'Lieut Whitman Co. E 51st N. Y.
      V. cheek' [the <em>Times</em> said "face"] and we are trying to
      comfort ourselves with hope that it may not be a serious hurt." Meanwhile,
      George had written to his mother on December 16, 1862, from a camp near
      Falmouth, Virginia.: "We have had another battle and I have come out safe and
      sound, although I had the side of my jaw slightly scraped with a peice of shell
      which burst at my feet" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare
      Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library)."Walter Whitman, a citizen,"
      obtained a pass on December 27, 1862, from General Edwin Vose Summers "to
      Washington [by] Rail R. government steamer" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection;
      Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> 9 vols. [New
      York: Rowan and Littlefield, 1906-1996], 2:157), and, upon his arrival on the
      following day, took rooms where the O'Connors were living; see Whitman's letter
      from 
      . Mrs. O'Connor described
      this meeting (her first) in "Personal Recollections of Walt Whitman," <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, 99 (1907), 825–834.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00758_n2">2. This letter is evidently
      lost.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00758_n3">3. Moses Fowler Odell
      (1818–1866) was a member of the House of Representatives (1861–1865)
      from New York.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00758_n4">4. Edward Ferrero
      (1831–1899) was appointed on October 14, 1861, colonel, Fifty-first New
      York Volunteers, and commanded George's regiment during the following winter.
      After the second battle of Bull Run, he was appointed brigadier general.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00758_n5">5. In an undated letter, but
      unquestionably written shortly after his promotion in December, George informed
      his mother: "Remember your galliant Son is a Capting, and expects you to keep up
      the dignity of the family, and darn the expense" (Trent Collection).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00758_n6">6. George referred
      frequently to Henry W. Francis in his letters to his mother in 1862. His first
      impression, at New Bern, North Carolina, , was favorable: "Our first Leiut. Francis is a first rate fellow
      so I have tip top times." Later George informed his mother that Francis had
      asked his wife, who was staying in Burlington, Vermont, to call on Hannah. On
      August 3, 1862, Hannah informed her mother that "Mrs. Francis called, I liked
      her much." During the battle at Antietam, George commanded his company, "as the
      Captain was not well although he was on the field." George noted on , from near Antietam, that
      Francis had left on a twenty-day furlough, and on , he wrote: "Captain Francis has not come back yet,
      and I am getting almost tired of haveing the whole trouble and responsibility of
      the Company and some one else getting the pay for it." After his return, George
      related on , Francis was too
      unwell to resume command of the company.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00758_n7">7. Tom may be Thomas
      McCowell, mentioned in the letter from 
      . George noted, on
      , that Tom had received a
      letter from Whitman.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00758_n8">8. Samuel M. Pooley visited
      Mrs. Whitman on March 6, 1863 (see his letter to Walt Whitman of March 7, 1863,
      in Trent Collection, Duke University). He was taken prisoner in 1864 along with
      George; see Whitman's letters from 
       and
