   <p>Received your card of Dec 12 at [

       time I [
      <span class="unclear">saw?</span>]
       a remarkably favorable notice of your friend <u>Conway</u> by a female correspondent of a Nashville paper. Why not tell me of <u>your pleasure from his visit &amp;c &amp;c</u>? I have been thinking a long time about sending you some scraps of printed matter—among
      them some written by a Dr (M.D.) F.O. Ticknor of ([
      <span class="unclear">Columbus?</span>]
      ) Georgia. He was a poetical or at least fanciful writer in both verse and prose form
      fully as much so in prose as in verse. He was a <u>brisk</u> or piquant and pleasing scribbler yet an <u>extremist</u> and decidedly a <u>failure</u> as a <u>philosopher</u>. He died a year or so ago. I have not read much of what he wrote after the beginning
      of the war. (After getting from you John Burroughs' picture, I sent him in latter
      part of June '75 a short note and some scraps of Ticknor's <u>fanciful</u> writing about fruit-culture—directed to Esopus New York, his letter to you being

   <p>I got no notice of its receipt by him, which was quite a disappointment, as I would
      have been glad for him to have Ticknor's pieces.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have wanted you to see a notice in the N.Y. Weekly Sun of Dec 8 last of Joaquin
      Millers last volume—I dont doubt it was just—from reading his first volume and scraps occasionally, <u>I</u> call him ☞ a Poet "by the skin of his teeth"—have done so for near two years—he writes
      <u>some</u> pretty passages.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Have you ever read Weems' Life of Washington?—written for children but really best
      suited for "pert" men—I have <u>bragged on</u> it for twenty years.

   <p>(Uncle Walt! oo mus' talk—oo mus' be <u>tonguetied</u></p>
   
   
   <p>You have doubtless read so much about <u>everything</u> that I would like an opportunity to ask you a question or more on Intellectual or
      Moral Philosophy. Do all writers who deny Free Will and yet wish to find <u>room for blame</u>, make the same <u>ridiculous blunder</u> that is made by <u>Abercrombie</u> in his Int. Phil. for Schools? he says we may blame a man to-day (tho' not free) because in time past (when <u>feeling</u> himself free ☞ tho' not so ☜) he did wrong repeatedly and brought himself to be of such a character that
      <u>right motives</u> can't have their proper effect. Absurd, Absurd, &amp;c &amp;c "All is <u>truth</u> without exception".
   </p>
   
   <p>About ten months ago a Presiding Elder of the Methodist church, after "talking around
      the edges" (as I called it) of the <u>great question</u> (Religion), and being much surprised and a little frightened (doubtless) by the quiet
      strength and yet charitable tenderness of the philosopher, admitted the latter was
      perfectly <u>sane</u>, and "yet there must be <u>a screw loose somewhere</u>. Walt! do you think there is "a screw loose somewhere" in all advocates of Orthodoxy?
      I know there is with many, and it is thus—their <u>conceit</u> enables them to hope <u>they</u> will escape "the wrath to come" and with that weak <u>moral sense</u> that will "always praise the bridge that passes <u>me</u> over safely," they <u>are</u> satisfied. If you encourage me to write, and say you will sometimes <u>write to me</u> I will buy <u>me some pens</u>—one of my [
      <span class="unclear">curious?</span>]
       ways I dont write much to anybody but you (What! bestow all they tediousness on me?")

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.
