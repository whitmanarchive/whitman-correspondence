   <p>Thanks, my dear E C S, for the box of noble books with the endless mines in them—&amp;
      double thanks for the loving cheering (I fear flattering) long letter, wh' has done
      me good, &amp; I have read twice—My friendly &amp; liberal presentation 7th Vol. is
      thoroughly appreciated by me—&amp; the picture is certainly printed at its best—The
      whole presentation indeed is by far the best of that sort I ever received. I wish
      to
      convey my best regards to the printers, proof-readers &amp; print-plate presser
      &amp;c<sup><a href="#hun.00055_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been specially laid up for nearly a year almost entirely disabled—imprison'd
      in sick room—last fall &amp; during winter sometimes low, serious, but just now easier,
      comparatively free from pain—getting along better than you might suppose.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Our dear friend O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r3">3</a></sup> is very ill at Washington (lower legs paralyzed, &amp; lately
      attacks of epilepsy)—Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r4">4</a></sup> is pretty well—is at his place West Park Ulster Co:
      with his wife &amp; boy (with a book in press, I believe)—Best regards &amp; love to you &amp;
      yours—Have put off this letter of thanks &amp; good wishes waiting for a day I sh'd
      feel pretty well to write it in, but such day lagging I delay no longer—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="hun.00055_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Edmund C Stedman | 3 east Fourteenth Street | (C E Webster Publisher's) | New
      York City. It is postmarked: Camden (?) | Mar 31 | 5 PM | 89.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hun.00055_n2">2. Stedman, who termed
      himself on  "one of your most faithful
      lovers," gushed about the <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em>:
      "There is no book just like this, &amp; there never will be." Whitman received
      more space in <em>The Library of American Literature</em> than any
      other poet. Stedman printed Linton's wood engraving of the poet. See Whitman's
       letter to Anne Gilchrist
      for his earlier reaction to Stedman's criticism.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">3. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">4. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
