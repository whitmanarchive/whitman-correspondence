      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter came Saturday, with the acc't of the accident 
      &amp; sudden death of little Andrew—poor little child—I believe I have never seen him—it
      was sad enough—but the poor young one 
      is out of this world of sin &amp; trouble—&amp; I don't know as we 
      have any cause to mourn for him—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, my leave of absence will commence early next week, 
      but I will send you word two or three days before-hand, when I shall come on. 
      I have a good long leave, &amp; want to rest myself as much as possible, 
      &amp; have a change of scene, &amp; a quiet time, &amp; no literary or other work to bother me—only
      just have a good quiet moderate time, for somehow I feel as if 
      I wanted to throw off everything like work or thought, for a while—&amp; be with my old
      mammy at least a good part of the time—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr. Evarts<sup><a href="#tex.00188_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> is still away—O'Connor was to move to-day, but it is showery, 
      &amp; he has postponed it till Wednesday—I was up there last evening, 
      &amp; had tea &amp; spent the evening.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wrote to Han Saturday last,<sup><a href="#tex.00188_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; enclosed your letter in mine—I am still at Mrs. Benedict's<sup><a href="#tex.00188_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> 472 M st.—find it about as good as 
      I could probably get anywhere—most of the boarders have left—I and <em>another young man</em> are the only ones left—they were in the Departments, 
      &amp; were discharged—Many have been discharged within the last two months, 
      &amp; many more the end of this month are expected to be. 
      It makes great misery among some, especially with families—O'Connor &amp; Burroughs still
      retain their places—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, Mother, the summer is pretty well over—they say the folks 
      are coming home from the country, &amp;c—I am glad I didn't take my leave 
      1st of August, as I expected to, at one time—but was disappointed—When you get this
      I wish you to write one more letter—but no more till you see me—I think it is going
      to be a fine day—I am feeling well—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, I have a long job of copying to do for Ashton,<sup><a href="#tex.00188_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> so I will wind up my letter, 
      &amp; set about it—I shall write once more before I come—Good bye for this time, dear
      Mother.
      
   </p>
