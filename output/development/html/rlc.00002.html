      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received, (through Mr. Clausen)<sup><a href="#rlc.00002_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> your letter of 19th October, from Kopenhagen—&amp; I cheerfully forward you my poems
      "Leaves of Grass," &amp; a small prose work of mine, "Democratic Vistas." I also enclose
      several articles &amp; criticisms written about my books in England &amp; America within the
      last ten years.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>May I say, there is something about your letter &amp; application that has deeply pleased
      me. I should like to know your country &amp; people—&amp; especially you yourself, &amp; your
      poet Björnson<sup><a href="#rlc.00002_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—and Hans Andersen. How proud I should be to become known to you all.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pray let me hear from you—and if the books &amp; papers reach you safely.</p>
   
   
   <p>Please accept my best, brotherly good will.</p>
   
   
   <p>Any thing by mail will reach me addressed</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="rlc.00002_n1">1. Schmidt, editor of <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em>, wrote to Walt Whitman on
      October 19, 1871, "I intend to write an article about yourself and your writings
      in the above named periodical which is very much read in all the Scandinavian
      countries.…I therefore take the liberty to ask you, if you should not be
      willing to afford some new communications of yourself and your poetry to this
      purpose" (Library of Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00002_n2">2. Carl F. Clausen, termed in
      Schmidt's letter "my old friend and countryman," corresponded with Schmidt after
      he left Denmark in 1860; see Carl Roos, "Walt Whitman's Letters to a Danish
      Friend," <em>Orbis Litterarum</em>, 7 (1949), 34–39. The
      city directory in 1870 listed him as a draughtsman and in 1872 as a patent
      agent. He died of consumption in the middle 1870s; see Thomas Biggs Harned
      Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #108.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="rlc.00002_n3">3. Björnstjerne
      Björnson (1832–1910), Norwegian poet, dramatist, and novelist, was
      co-editor of Schmidt's journal. In his reply on , Schmidt observed: "Hans Christian Andersen would perhaps not
      make you very great joy, if you did know him personally. Björnson would be
      your man." Schmidt later altered his opinion of Björnson; see notes to
      Whitman's  letter to Schmidt.<a href="#r3">[back]
