      Dr. Mr. Whitman—
      
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>
      Our literary people are all agog over Mr. Howell's<sup><a href="#n4317" id="r2">2</a></sup> attempted dethronement of 
      Scott,<sup><a href="#n4277" id="r3">3</a></sup> and the preference which he assigns to Tolstoi over the 
      "Wizard of the North. Mr. Howell's has used a portion of your general 
      indictment of all the old-world literature [illegible]
      that they are saturated in the
      
      aristocratic spirit and lack that enthusiasum for democracy which the coming literature
      must have. Could you not give
      the public your views on the subject which is now cleaving literary Boston in twain?
      If you would not do this would 
      you be so kind as to give me your private view—I would not publish it if you so desired.
      If you desired to submit
      
      a ms. on the subject to the papers or magazines here I would be glad to present it
      for you and would
      get you the best possible terms. You do not now remember me—I therefore give as references—Mr
      A.H.
      Stephenson 214 Chestnut St Philadelphia—or Rev. Dr. A.A. Livermore Meadville, Pa.

   <p id="n4317">2. William Dean Howells
      (1837–1920) was an American realist novelist and literary critic, serving
      the staff of the <em>New York Nation</em> and <em>Harper's Magazine</em> during the mid 1860s. During his tenure as
      editor-in-chief of <em> The Atlantic Monthly</em> from 1871 to
      1880, he was one of the foremost critics in New York, and used his influence to
      support American authors like Hamlin Garland, Stephen Crane, and Emily
      Dickinson. He also brought attention to European authors like Henrik Ibsen,
      Giovanni Verga, and Leo Tolstoy in particular. Howells was highly skeptical of
      Whitman's poetry, however, and frequently questioned his literary merit. In an
      Ashtabula <em> Sentinel </em>review of the 1860 edition <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, Howells wrote, "If he is indeed 'the
      distinctive poet of America,' then the office of poet is one which must be left
      hereafter to the shameless and the friendless. for WALT WHITMAN is not a man
      whom you would like to know." In 1865, Howells would write the first important
      review of <em> Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Round
         Table</em>, demonstrating early signs of his conflicted opinion about
      Whitman. For more information on Howells, see Goodman, Susan &amp; Dawson, Carl,
      <em>William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life</em> (Berkeley:
      University of California Press, 2005).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n4277">3. Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832)
      was a Scottish statesman, historical novelist, playwright, and poet, best known
      for <em>Ivanhoe</em> (1820), <em>The Lady of the
         Lake</em> (1810), and <em>Waverly</em> (1814). For more on
      Scott, see Vickie L. Taft, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_209.html">Scott, Sir Walter (1771)–1832)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
