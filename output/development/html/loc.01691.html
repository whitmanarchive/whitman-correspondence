   <p>Would the accompanying piece, "Passage to India," be available to you, to be printed
      as leading article 
      in either the June or July number of the "Overland"? The price is $200, and I should
      like 20 copies of the number—I reserve the right to print it in future book. My address
      is at this office.

   <p id="loc.01691_n1">2. On , Bret Harte replied for the <em>Overland Monthly</em>: "I fear that the 'Passage to India' is
      a poem too long and too abstract for the hasty and material-minded readers of
      the <em>O. M.</em>." Though Whitman liked "The Outcasts of Poker
      Flat" (Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.34.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996], 4:208), he
      felt that "somehow when [Harte] went to London the best American in him was left
      behind and lost" (Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.15.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996], 1:28). In a
      newspaper interview in 1879, Whitman objected to Harte's "ruffians and delirium
      tremens specimens.…I think it is an outrage. He seems to me to have taken
      Dickens' treatment of the slums of London and transferred it to California." See
      Robert Hubach, "Three Uncollected St. Louis Interviews of Walt Whitman," <em>American Literature</em>, 14.2 (May 1942), 146.<a href="#r2">[back]
