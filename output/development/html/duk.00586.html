   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00586_n8">1. This letter dates to
      December 7, 1869. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "December 7," and
      Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1869. Edwin Haviland Miller cited
      Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). The concurrence of familial,
      social, and public matters provides assurance that the year is correct. Henry
      Clapp, Walt Whitman's friend from Pfaff's Beer Cellar, had resumed contact with
      Abby and Helen Price earlier in the year. George Washington Whitman had begun
      repaying loans to both of his brothers, Walt Whitman and Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman, though his employment as a pipe inspector for the Brooklyn Water Works
      was somewhat unsettled since the appointment of a new Water Board. Also, the
      expected appointment of a new attorney general is almost certainly that of
      Ebenezer R. Hoar. The brief mention of Henry Ward Beecher refers to his
      involvement in a public scandal known as the Richardson-McFarland affair. In
      addition, December 7 fell on Tuesday, and that day of the week is consistent
      with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's surprise that Walt's letter, which she received
      on Monday morning, was sent on Sunday. Weekend overnight mail delivery from
      Washington, D.C. to Brooklyn, New York, was unusual but was shocking to Louisa
      only because the letter was written Sunday afternoon.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00586_n4">2. Walt Whitman's December 5,
      1869 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:362).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00586_n3">3. Adams Express, a packet
      delivery service, was noted for its fast delivery, trustworthiness, and its
      guarantee of privacy for shippers. The Whitmans used Adams Express to transfer
      larger sums of money both during and after the war, but Walt Whitman generally
      sent his mother smaller sums via the postal service. George Washington Whitman
      was repaying in installments a loan that Walt had made to him when George was
      struggling financially in his speculative housebuilding business. For Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's account of George's loans from Walt and from his brother Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman, see her  letter to
      Walt. For more on Adams Express, see Hollis Robbins, "Fugitive Mail: The
      Deliverance of Henry 'Box' Brown and Antebellum Postal Politics," <em>American Studies</em> 50:1/2 (2009), 12–13.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">4. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00586_n7">5. A memorial stone for a
      Rebecca Denton Van Velsor (1791?–1871) is present in Brooklyn's Green-Wood
      Cemetery, and the woman identified by Louisa Van Velsor Whitman as "Aunt Becca"
      may be a great aunt or other distant relative of Walt Whitman. Aunt Becca is
      mentioned also Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters of  and .<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00586_n13">6. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      phonetic spelling "mobeal" refers to Mobile, Alabama. The woman named "old mrs
      man" is the mother of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's former downstairs neighbor at
      the 1194 Atlantic Street, Mary E. Mann. Mary Mann sent for her mother (the "old
      lady") in Mobile, Alabama, shortly after the death of her young son Charley Mann
      (see Louisa's  and  letters to Walt Whitman). Also
      see Mary E. Mann's  letter to Louisa
      (Library of Congress).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00586_n6">7. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      refers to Henry Clapp, Jr. (1814–1875), one of Walt Whitman's close
      friends and a leading figure among the bohemians with whom Whitman gathered at
      the Pfaff's restaurant and beer cellar in lower Manhattan. Clapp was the editor
      of a short-lived but influential literary weekly, the <em>New-York
         Saturday Press</em>. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had reported earlier in the
      year, according to Helen Price, that Clapp "was tipsey nearly all the time" (see
      Louisa's  letter to Walt). For a
      profile of Clapp, see <em>Vault at Pfaffs: An Archive of Art and
         Literature by New York City's Nineteenth-Century Bohemians</em>, ed., Edward
      Whitley (http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/pfaffs/).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n11">8. Helen Price was the
      daughter of Abby and Edmund Price. Abby Price and her family, especially her
      daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman and his mother, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman. Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform
      movements. Price's husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and
      the couple had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in
      1852, at 2 years of age). In 1860, the Price family began to save Walt's
      letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman were included in Richard Maurice
      Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1883), and she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters to
      her mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00586_n14">9. The phrase "falanks Jersey"
      is difficult to decipher. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in her  letter to Walt Whitman said that Henry
      Clapp, Jr., was to "put up at lessey[?] farlands." The quizzical phrase "lessey
      farlands" in that letter may refer to same place as "falanks" in this letter.
      She may refer to a boarding house, or the phrase may be yet another alternate
      spelling for Florence, New Jersey, also the site of an R. D. Wood foundry at
      which George Washington Whitman inspected pipe.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00586_n17">10. Henry Ward Beecher
      (1813–1887), Congregational clergyman and brother of Harriet Beecher
      Stowe, accepted the pastorate of the Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, in 1847, and he
      became one of America's most influential ministers. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      son Edward Whitman attended Beecher's church regularly. Louisa may be
      paraphrasing a short newspaper article, which remarked that Beecher was "getting
      it all around" ("The News," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>,
      December 6, 1869, 2). This late-1869 scandal, known as the Richardson-McFarland
      matter, targeted Beecher because he had performed a deathbed marriage ceremony
      for the prominent New York <em>Tribune</em> correspondent Albert
      Richardson. Richardson was shot in the <em>Tribune</em> office by
      Daniel McFarland, the ex-husband of Abby Sage McFarland, an actress who was
      reported to be Richardson's lover. Abby McFarland had moved to Indiana, with
      Richardson's assistance, to secure a divorce. Upon his ex-wife's return from
      Indiana with divorce papers, Daniel McFarland shot Richardson. The ensuing
      public scandal targeted Beecher: he was accused of endorsing bigamy because
      "Indiana divorces were not recognized in New York State" (see Debby Applegate,
      <em>The Most Famous Man in America</em> [New York: Doubleday,
      1996], 388). Beecher's own extramarital relationships with married women
      including Chloe Beach and Elizabeth Tilton were fodder for Brooklyn gossip, and
      Beecher's shaky standing on marriage was a frequent part of the scandal coverage
      in the <em>New York Sun</em> and the <em>Brooklyn
         Daily Eagle</em> (see Applegate, 365–70; 388). Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman probably followed the Richardson-McFarland scandal in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> (see "Mr. Beecher at the Bedside,"
      December 1, 1869, 2; "The Shooting Cases," December 4, 1869, 2).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00586_n19">11. The new attorney general,
      who had not been announced, would be Ebenezer R. Hoar (1816–1895).
      President Ulysses S. Grant (1822–1885) appointed Hoar to the office on
      December 15, 1869 (see Mark Grossman, <em>Encyclopedia of the
         United States Cabinet</em> [Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2000], 1:79–80).
      Hoar replaced William M. Evarts, and as attorney general he presided over the
      office in which Walt Whitman served as a clerk.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">12. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00586_n5">13. George Washington Whitman's
      position as an inspector for the Brooklyn Water Works became more tenuous after
      the April 1869 reorganization of the Brooklyn Board of Water Commissioners.
      Moses Lane, chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works, resigned shortly after
      the new board was seated. For details on the new water board and the anxiety
      that it provoked in Lane, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00470_n8">14. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
      and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r14">[back]
