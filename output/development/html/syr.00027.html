      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have your postal card of the 17th, and enclose the article from the <u>Nation</u>—an infamous article. I would give a great
      deal to know <u>who</u> is the writer. <u>Is it not possible to find this out</u>?
   </p>
   
   <p>You mention it as in the N.Y. <u>Evening Post</u>, of which
      the <u>Nation</u> is a weekly issue, though without
      containing all its matter. So I am not sure that this libel was in both
      papers.
   </p>
   
   <p>I also enclose a press  copy of my reply, and of the note I subsequently addressed
      with the <u>MS</u> to the <u>Times</u>.
      Montgomery wrote me a very kind note, saying that the <u>Times</u> editor wouldn't print my article for "professional
      reasons"—which simply means, I suppose, that dog will not eat dog, or that
      one member of the journalistic <u>condottieri</u> will stand
      by another in his iniquity.
   </p>
   
   <p>When I read the article over just now, it seemed a little better than I at first
      thought it. I was quite ill and weighed down with  lassitude when I wrote
      it,—spurred only by my indignation. Upon its return from the <u>Times</u>, I had a vague wandering notion of sending it to
      the <u>Critic</u>, as my blue pencil memorandum on the first
      sheet indicates. But I suppose it is no use. I felt rather deterred by the
      remembrance of Gilder's unfriendly spat at me when I was fighting that
      contemptible clergyman, Chadwick, and was so clearly in the right. I had thought
      of him previously as a friend of yours.
   </p>
   
   <p>I also enclose a slip from the <u>Nation</u> which shows  Dr. William
      Hand Browne in the noble and honorable light of trying to edit out of poor
      Lanier's silly lectures, the little praise he had bestowed on you—an
      effort baffled only by the right instincts of the poet's widow. What a lot of
      helldevils the literati are, to be sure!
   </p>
   
   <p>Send me back the slips sometime.</p>
   
   <p>I am glad you saw Marvin. He is the best of friends, and is firm in the
      faith.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope to get away for a few days soon. I am still in charge of the office,
      and much burdened. More anon. I got your curious Shakespeare letter. Is he
      crazy? Au revoir.
   </p>
