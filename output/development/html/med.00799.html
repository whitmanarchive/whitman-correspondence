   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>This correspondent may be Francis
      Fisher Browne (1843â€“1913), the author of <em>The Every-Day
         Life of Abraham Lincoln</em> (1886). Browne, editor of the literary monthly
      <em>The Dial</em>, was familiar with Whitman's work, having
      written <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1881/anc.00087.html">a review</a> of the 1881-82 edition of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>. In his biography of Lincoln, Browne reprinted Whitman's poem "O
      Captain ! My Captain!" under the title "Walt Whitman's Poem on President
      Lincoln's Death." It is possible that Browne sent Whitman a copy of the
      biography, to which Whitman is here responding.
