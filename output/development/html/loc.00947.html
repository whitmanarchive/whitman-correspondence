      <br></br>400 L Street.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>How I wish you were with us this beautiful day! It is so warm that I sit here with
      three windows wide open. I have a little fire in the stove, and the sun pours in full
      and strong. It is a perfect day, &amp; seems more like May than November.
   </p>
   
   <p>How are you? &amp; is there any hope of your coming this way this winter? I have hoped
      you would, but I begin to despair of it, as you have not come yet, and we have not
      heard from you. We have been feeling very blue at the prospect of losing Charley Eldridge.<sup><a href="#loc.00947_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> The Major is to be ordered to Boston, so they hear, tho they have not got their orders
      yet, and of course Charley goes with him. It is two weeks since they first heard a
      rumor of it, but I think they will go before Christmas. As soon as he told us, I thought
      that that lost us one more chance of seeing you, as he had asked you to stay with
      him at his room. How lonely we shall be with both you &amp; Charley gone! I don't think
      of it any more than I can help.
   </p>
   
   <p>Every evening we talk of you, &amp; wish you were here, &amp; almost every evening we read
      from Leaves of Grass, read &amp; admire. I don't believe, dear Walt, that you have in
      all the world, two heartier lovers &amp; appreciators than William &amp; Charley.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>What news of your brother George? I think of him very often. How is your mother now?
      &amp; are the babies well?
   </p>
   
   <p>I presume you have seen Mr. Howells, if so you know that he has moved his family to
      New York.<sup><a href="#loc.00947_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> He has a position in the Custom House, &amp; still retains, or was to retain his room where we
      called on him. Ms. Wood has not come back, &amp; the Dr. talks of leaving, if he does,
      I shall miss Ms. Wood, for I still hope that she will come.<sup><a href="#loc.00947_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>John Johnson was wounded the last of Sept. and is at home now. His arm was shot below
      the elbow. He come in the other day &amp; sat an hour with me. He asked for you. He was
      seventeen years old yesterday, &amp; has been in service more than a year, he is very
      impatient to get well &amp; go back to his company.
   </p>
   
   <p>We had a letter from Mr. &amp; Mrs. Croffut, they both asked for you, you know they live
      in Rochester now. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you remember Mrs. Balch who dined with us once last spring? she &amp; her husband are
      to live up stairs. We expect them this week from Boston. I was so glad to know that
      Mrs. Ginnaty was not to be my neighbor.
   </p> 
   
   <p>The Gwynnes live in their own house now, &amp; I guess very much in the old way.<sup><a href="#loc.00947_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I don't know any more news to tell you. Just now I am very well, but I was quite sick soon after I got back, &amp; thought I had lost all I had gained,
      but I am much better again, &amp; find that I am very much better than I was last autumn.
      Jeannie is well, though she, too, has had an ill turn, she is just learning to read.
      I teach her every day now. William has a terrible cold just now, &amp; sore throat, but
      has been very well &amp; vigorous, as hearty as ever.
   </p>
   
   <p>We got home very well, and had a good journey. I am glad that we had the day with
      you, it was some satisfaction to see you for even so short a time.
   </p>
   
   <p>The election passed-off well, didn't it? &amp; I am so glad that we are to have a better
      Congress next time. The Woods out, &amp; some others like them. This three months will
      soon go.
   </p>
   
   <p>We feel very hopeful about Sherman, especially as this fine weather will help him
      so much. Do you think Grant will do any thing this fall?
   </p>
   
   <p>The Count asks for you every time that he sees William or Charley.<sup><a href="#loc.00947_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> He says he wants to see you, &amp; sends love.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We wished for you on Thanksgiving day. We had a quiet day, no one with us but Charley,
      he dined with us, &amp; we all wished that you were here.
   </p>
   
   <p>William sees Mr. Swinton sometimes, I have not seen him yet.</p>
   
   <p>What about your poems? are you at work on them now? &amp; what about publishing? have
      you done any thing since we came on?
   </p>
   
   <p>Write, won't you? I want to hear from you very much. I have spoken of writing every
      day since I came back, but have hardly touched a pen at all.
   </p>
   
   <p>Tell me what you hear from your brother.</p>
   
   <p>I have not yet been in any hospital since I came home, but I mean to go.</p>
   
   <p>Enclosed I send you the little poem that we spoke of by Ms. Beach.<sup><a href="#loc.00947_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>William says every day that he is going to write you, &amp; he will soon.</p>
   
   <p>How is Ms. Price?<sup><a href="#loc.00947_n8" id="r7">7</a></sup> My love to your mother, &amp; very much to you, always, dear Walt, from

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years, and he speaks often in his letters of their daughter Jean, by nickname
      "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break in late
      1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated black citizens,
      Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence between Whitman and
      Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For
      more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see also Dashae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

      D. Kummings, ed., (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00947_n1">1. In December 1862, on his
      way to visit George at Fredericksburg, Virginia, Whitman stopped in Washington
      and encountered Charles W. Eldridge, who was now a clerk in the office of the
      army paymaster. After he had seen for himself that George had not been severely
      wounded, he returned to Washington, which was to be his home until 1873.
      Eldridge obtained a desk for Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the
      army paymaster.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00947_n3">2. Charles Joseph Howells,
      according to entries in New York Directories, must have been versatile (and
      perhaps eccentric): in 1864–1865 he was an "inventor," in 1865–1866
      an inspector in the Custom House, in 1866–1867 simply an "inspector," and
      in 1867–1868 a seller of hairpins.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00947_n4">3. George Wood
      (1799–1870) worked as a clerk in the Treasury Department in 1822, and he
      held various posts in that bureau until his death. He was the author of several
      satirical works, <em>Peter Schlemihl in America</em>
      (Philadelphia: Carey and Hart, 1848) and <em>The Gates Wide Open;
         or, Scenes in Another World</em> (Boston: Lee and Shepard, 1869); see <em>National Cyclopaedia of American Biography</em>. Undoubtedly
      he became acquainted with Whitman through Ellen and William O'Connor. Ellen
      O'Connor mentioned a Mr. Wood in her letter of . In reply to Whitman's letter, evidently delivered by O'Connor
      and dated "Thursday"—probably —Wood wrote: "You sometimes find a poor soldier whom a Small Sum
      would relieve and I beg you will distribute these pieces of paper as you shall
      see best on your visit to the Hospital."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00947_n5">4. Carey Gwynne was listed
      in the 1866 Directory as a clerk in the Treasury Department.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00947_n6">5. Count Adam Gurowski
      (1805–1866), a Polish exile, published an eccentric three-volume Diary
      (1862–1866), a day-by-day account of the war written with a marked
      partiality toward extreme abolitionists. The Count was a colorful figure: he
      covered his lost eye with a "green blinder," and "he had a Roman head...a
      powerful topknot, in and out: people always stopped to look at him" (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York, Rowman
      and Littlefield, 1961], 3:79, 96). William D. O'Connor, who apparently
      translated Gurowski's manuscripts into English (see the letter from Gurowski to
      O'Connor in Feinberg), reported to Whitman on , that "he is a madman with lucid intervals"—he had
      attempted "to discipline the firemen with a
      pistol."
      Whitman maintained to Traubel in 1888 that "he was truly a remarkable, almost
      phenomenal, man," and that "he was, no doubt, very crazy, but also very sane"
      (3:79, 340). Ellen O'Connor related in a letter on , that the Count had said to her recently: "My Gott,
      I did not know that [Walt Whitman] was such a poet, tell him so, I have been
      trying every where to find him to tell him myself." In the last volume of the
      Diary, Gurowski placed Whitman's name in the first category of his threefold
      evaluation of persons "mentioned in this volume": "Praise," "Half and Half," and
      "Blame." The Count referred in his entry for April 18, 1864, to Whitman as among
      "the most original and genuine American hearts and minds" (187). In a footnote
      (372–373), appended September 12, 1865, Gurowski abused Harlan, who had
      "shown himself to be animated by a spirit of narrow-minded persecution that
      would honor the most fierce Spanish or Roman inquisitor." Gurowski was praised
      by Robert Penn Warren, in Malcolm Cowley, ed., <em>Writers at
         Work: The "Paris Review" Interviews</em>, (New York: Viking, 1958), 189. See
      also LeRoy Fischer, <em>Mississippi Valley Historical Review</em>,
      36 (1949–1950): 415–434, and the <em>Dictionary of
         American Biography, Supplement One</em> (New York: Scribner, 1944).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00947_n7">6. Juliette H. Beach was one
      of those enigmatic women associated with Whitman about whom imaginative
      biographers have spun ingenious theories. Beach was to have reviewed the 1860
      edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> for the <em>Saturday Press</em>, but when her husband's unfavorable review was
      published instead, the journal had to take public note of matrimonial discord in
      order to correct the error (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary
         Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: Macmillan,
      1955; rev. ed., New York University Press, 1967], 260–262). Ellen O'Connor
      contributed her bit to the theory that Beach and Whitman had a love affair when
      she asserted that "Out of the Rolling Ocean, the Crowd," published in <em>Drum-Taps</em>, was composed for "a certain lady" who had
      angered her husband because of her correspondence with the poet (Emory Holloway,
      ed., <em>The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman</em>
      [Garden City, New York: Doubleday, Page, 1921], 1:lviii). "Mrs. Beach's notes"
      may be the letters to Whitman, which later John Burroughs vainly asked Mrs.
      Beach to print; see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1931), 1:120. If these
      were love letters, Whitman hardly treated Mrs. Beach's heart-stirrings
      discreetly. See also Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em>,
      340–342.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00947_n8">7. The Prices were friends
      of Mrs. Whitman. The husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn; see
      Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em>, 199–200. His wife Abby,
      as one might expect, was closer to Whitman, who corresponded with her frequently
      in the 1860s. Whitman always interested himself in the Price children, Helen,
      Emma, and Arthur (another son, Henry, had died at 2 years of age). Helen's
      reminiscences were included in Bucke's biography, and she printed for the first
      time some of Whitman's letters to her mother, in <em>Putnam's
         Monthly</em>, 5 (1908), 163–169.<a href="#r7">[back]
