      <br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Shortly after posting your first letter to Mr. Linton,<sup><a href="#n6008" id="r2">2</a></sup> I 
      re'cd
      
       word from him to forward the block<sup><a href="#loc.03271_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> to Mr Arthur Stedman<sup><a href="#n4177" id="r4">4</a></sup> of Mesrs. Webster
      &amp; Co. #3 East 14th St. N.Y.
   </p>
   
   <p>In acknowledging its receipt Sept 26th, Mr Stedman said that as soon as an electro
      could be taken it would be returned to me—but I have seen nothing of it
      yet.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have heard nothing further from Mr Linton with regard to the block—there
      has been hardly time—but will take the responsibility—of sending it
      on to you as soon as I get it
   </p>

      Very truly yours

   <p id="n6008">2. William J. Linton
      (1812–1897), a British-born wood engraver, came to the United States in
      1866 and settled near New Haven, Connecticut. He illustrated the works of John
      Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, and
      others, wrote the "indispensable" <em>History of Wood-Engraving in
         America</em> (1882), and edited <em>Poetry of America,
         1776–1876</em> (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Whitman's
      poems as well as a frontispiece engraving of the poet. According to his <em>Threescore and Ten Years, 1820 to
         1890—Recollections</em> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Whitman
      in Washington and later visited him in Camden (which Whitman reported in his
      , letter to Peter Doyle): "I
      liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, . . . a true poet
      who could not write poetry, much of 
      wilfulness
      
       accounting for his neglect of form."<a href="#r2">[back]
