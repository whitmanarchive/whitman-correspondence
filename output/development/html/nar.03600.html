   <p>Yours of June 30, informing me of the necessity of terminating my services in the
      Solicitor's office, Treasury, is respectfully acknowledged.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I see that the dismissed clerks in the Treasury, &amp;c. are to have two months extra
      pay, (July &amp; August.) Can this allowance be made to me?

      Very respectfully,
      <br></br>Walt Whitman

      this class who can be discharged with least detriment to the national service"
      (National Archives). On , Williams
      informed the poet of his dismissal. On July 6, 1874, (copy in the National
