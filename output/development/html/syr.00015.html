      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I copy the foregoing from page 709, in the May number of the Contemporary Review
      in an article: "The Interpretation of Litterature" by Professor Dowden,<sup><a href="#n0199" id="r1">1</a></sup> thinking you may not have seen it, and it may give you
      pleasure to see it. At Venice, a year ago, I met Mr. Symmonds,<sup><a href="#n0615" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      an English author of eminence, who greatly admired your writings and was eager
      to hear of you. Whenever I hear your works mentioned it is with a frank and
      outspoken admiration formerly more rare. And though you  must hear this now from all
      sides, still there may be moments when a friendly reiteration of it coming
      unexpectedly may not be uncheering to you. I think your works are doing good in
      the world. The revelation which is in the life all around us and in ourselfs is
      more listened to, more respected. What is true, then, is more respected, what is
      natural is more respected; less violence is done to nature, or at any rate urged
      and insisted on as what ought to be done. Happiness is increased, increasing,
      &amp; is to be probably immeasurably more increased. To have had a share, and so
      large a share, in this work must be a great happiness &amp; cause of thankfulness
      for you. Excuse so long a letter. I meant it to be shorter. It calls for no
      answer. I hope all goes well with you. That you  are in fair health and fair
      spirits, without pains of body or spirit, or cares or anxieties. I remember you
      always with gratitude and affection—both for your books and yourself. 
   </p>

   <p> "We can point to no writer who drew early to his side a small band of eminent
      disciples and at the same time suffered shame and scoffing on total neglect from
      the crowd, who did not in the end prove a power in literature and gradually win
      acceptance from the world. Such was Wordsworth's position in the opening years
      of this century; such a little later was Shelley's position. Such was Carlyle's
      half a century since, and Mr. Browning's at a date more recent. Such also was
      Mr. Whitman's position until of late, when a considerable<sup><a href="#syr.00015_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> 
       company has gathered to
      his side and the voice of opposition has almost fallen silent."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0199">1. Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>). For more, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_93.html">Dowden, Edward (1843–1913)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0615">2. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
