   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00556_n7">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      dated the letter November 25. The year 1868, added by Richard Maurice Bucke, is
      certain because it is consistent with multiple family matters: Martha Mitchell
      Whitman's convalescence from throat surgery, Thomas Jefferson Whitman's recent
      arrival from St. Louis, George Washington Whitman's presence in Brooklyn (he
      returned recently from Camden), and Walt Whitman's correspondence with Dr.
      Samuel Thayer in Burlington, Vermont, about his sister Hannah Heyde's recent
      thumb surgery (also see Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>,
      ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:366). Louisa wrote that she received a letter from Walt "to day wensday," his
       letter; November 25, the
      date in Louisa's hand, fell on a Wednesday in 1868. Therefore, November 25, 1868
      is certain for the date of this letter.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n11">2. See Walt Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman. Walt stated his confidence that his mother had received his Saturday,
      November 21, 1868 letter, but that letter is not extant (see Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:361). Miller dated the missing
      letter November 20?, 1868.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n8">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. Mattie had arrived in Brooklyn for a
      visit and medical evaluation and treatment in mid-October. For a report on
      Mattie's medical condition, see Walt Whitman's  letter to Jeff Whitman. Mattie and Jeff had two
      daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters
      moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the
      position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie's throat ailment led to
      her death in February 1873. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed.,
      <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em>
      (New York: New York University Press, 1977), 1–26. <br><br>
      The money that George Washington Whitman had advanced to Mattie ($50), which
      Jeff did not repay, became a matter of misunderstanding in the accounting of
      the loans that Jeff had extended to George (see Louisa's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n5">5. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
      adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
      he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
      St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      Walt Whitman inquired in his 
      letter whether Jeff had arrived, and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman confirmed his
      arrival in Brooklyn on Friday, November 20.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00469_n13">6. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a French-born landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa
      Whitman (1823–1908), Walt Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington,
      Vermont. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive
      letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman often spoke
      disparagingly of Heyde in her letters to Walt: "i had a letter or package from
      charley hay three sheets of foolscap paper and a fool wrote on them" (see her
       to Walt).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n12">7. Hannah Heyde
      (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided in
      Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles L. Heyde. Hannah in late 1868 is
      suffering from a thumb infection. She wrote: "I am so anxious about my hand I
      fear I shall lose my thumb I cant see it gets &amp; feels or looks much better.
      It pained me last night more than usual." Heyde described Hannah's hand as
      follows: "Her hand is yet very distressing. Dr Thayer says that he cannot decide
      how it will terminate. The finger next her thumb is perfectly torpid and half
      closed and the others are not much better (Charles L. Heyde and Hannah Heyde's
      November 24, 1868 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, Duke University, Trent
      Collection). The complications from the infection led Doctor Samuel W. Thayer to
      lance her wrist in November 1868 and to amputate her thumb the following month
      (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's 
      letter to Walt Whitman; see Charles L. Heyde's December 1868 letter to Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman, Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His
         Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949],
      225–26).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00555_n2">8. Samuel W. Thayer, a
      Professor of Anatomy at the University of Vermont Medical School, performed
      surgeries in Burlington, Vermont during the 1860s. Walt Whitman inquired about
      Hannah's health in his  letter to
      Thayer. For the Whitman family's bitterness toward Charles L. Heyde and the
      stress that Hannah's health crisis introduced between Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and George Washington Whitman, see Horace Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.70.html">Wednesday, January 9, 1889</a>, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> (New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914), 3:499–500.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n1">9. During the 1860s, Abby Price
      and her family, especially her daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman
      and his mother Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. The Price family began to save Walt
      Whitman's letters, and Helen's reminiscences of Whitman are included in Richard
      Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia:
      David McKay, 1883). Helen printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters
      to her mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n9">10. Walt Whitman had visited
      Thomas Davis (1806–1895) in Providence, Rhode Island during his October
      1868 vacation. Davis, a jewelry manufacturer, served both in Rhode Island's
      state house of representatives and state senate. He also served one term as
      Rhode Island's representative in Congress. See the <em>Biographical Directory of the United States Congress</em>. For Walt
      Whitman's visit to Davis during his October vacation, see his  letter to Charles W.
      Eldridge.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n14">11. Walt Whitman had inquired,
      "Has George done any thing about the Portland av. house, yet?" (see his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman).<a href="#r11">[back]
