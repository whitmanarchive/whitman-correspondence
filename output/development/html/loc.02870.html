   <p>Such a joyful surprise was that last paper you sent me, with the Poem celebrating the great events in Spain—the new
      hopes the new life wakening in the hearts
      
      of that fine People which has slumbered so long weighed down &amp; tormented with
      hideous nightmares of 
       superstition. Are you indeed
      getting strong &amp; well again? able to drink in draughts of pleasure from the
      sights &amp; sounds &amp; perfumes of this delicious time,
      "lilac-time"—according to your wont? Sleeping well—[
      <span class="unclear">eating well,</span>]
       dear
      Friend? 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>William Rossetti is coming to
      see me Thursday, before starting for his holiday trip to Naples. His father was a
      Neapolitan, who
      
      narrowly escaped a lifelong dungeon  for having written some patriotic Songs—he fled in disguise
      by help of English [
      <span class="unclear">friends &amp;</span>]
       spent the rest of his life here. So this, his first
      visit to Naples, will be specially full of interest &amp; delight to our friend. He
      is also in great spirits at having discovered a large number of hitherto unknown
      early letters of Shelley's. Of modern English Poets Shelley is the one he loves
      &amp; admires incomparably the most.—Perhaps this letter will just reach you
       on your birthday.
      What can I send you? What can I tell you but the same old story of a heart fast
      anchored—of a soul to whom your soul is as the sun &amp; the fresh, sweet air,
      and the nourishing, sustaining earth wherein the other one breathes free &amp; feeds
      &amp; expands &amp; delights itself. There is no occupation of the day however
      homely that is not coloured, elevated, made more cheerful to me by thought of you
      &amp; by thoughts you have  given me blent in &amp; suffusing all: No hope or aim or
      practical endeavour for my dear children that has not taken a higher larger more
      joyous scope through you. No immortal aspiration, no thoughts of what lies beyond
      death but centre in you. And in moods of pain and discouragement dear Friend I turn
      to that Poem beginning "Whoever you are holding me now in hand" and I don't know but
      that that one revives &amp; strengthens  me more than any. For there is not a
      line nor a word in it at which my spirit does not rise up instinctive and fearlessly
      say—So be it. And then I read other poems &amp; drink in [
      <span class="unclear">the draught that I</span>]
      
      know is for me, because it is for all—the love that you give me on the broad
      ground of my humanity and womanhood. And I understand the reality &amp;  preciousness of that.
      Then I say to myself Souls are not made to be frustrated—to have their
      greatest &amp; best &amp; sweetest impulses and aspirations &amp; yearnings made
      abortive. Therefore we shall not be "carried diverse" forever. This dumb soul of
      mine will not always remain hidden from you—but some way will be given me for
      this love, this passion of gratitude, this set of all the nerves of my being toward
      you, to bring joy 
      &amp; comfort to you. I do not ask the When or the How.— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall be thinking of your great &amp; dear Mother in her
      beautiful old age, too, on your birthday—happiest woman in all the world that
      she was &amp; is: forever sacred &amp; dear to America &amp; to all who feed on the
      Poems of her Son.

   <p>I suppose you see all that you care to see in the way of English newspapers. I
      often long to send you one when there is anything in that I feel sure would
      interest you, but am withheld by fearing it would be quite [

      troublesome even.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
