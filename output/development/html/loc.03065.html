      <br></br>Washington, D.C. 
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">September 20, 1882.                    
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have your postals of the 3rd and the 17th.</p>
   
   <p>Comstock takes the dare! He cowers, like a kicked spaniel, and does not venture to
      carry out his threat. I thought my letter would have the effect of making him cautious.
   </p>
   
   <p>Now for Tobey. Look 
      
      out for the Tribune. I have sent (last Saturday) an elaborate vivisection of the Boston
      postmaster and Oliver Stevens together, which, if the Tribune, publishes, will certainly
      make a big row. I think you will like it as well as my first letter. It is gay and
      stinging until near the close, when it rises and darkens into righteous anger. The
      
      
      Boston journals will surely respond to it, and Tobey will rue the day. Old orthodox
      rascal!
   </p>
   
   <p>Glad to hear your other book is near the launch. I got the programme—very attractive
      and picturesque. I only regretted that you had included your paper on Poe, which I
      think all mistaken. Every one flings a stone at poor Edgar—Stedman's, the worst of
      all. 
      
      No such man as you fancy ever got and held the love of such a woman as Helen Whitman.
      I know so much about him through her, and through much reading of what he wrote, that
      I cannot help deploring all adverse criticism upon him.
   </p>
   
   <p>Frothingham's article is fair, but unworthy of him. The <u>arriere pensee</u> is evident. He thinks better of your book than he dares 
      
      to write. But such cowardice is simply shameful. A scholar ought to be a soldier,
      and face the batteries proudly.
   </p>
   
   <p>I will send the "Modern Thought" to Bucke soon. Hurrah for Molloy! I read his article
      with gratification. Apropos, I wish you would tell me just what Ruskin said about
      L. of G., for 
       
      I discover that it was to you, or some near friend of yours, that he wrote. I want
      to know very much.
   </p>
   
   <p>Is there any chance of Rees Welsh printing Bucke's book? I wish it might be done.
      It would help, and now is the time, while public interest is alive.
   </p>
   
   <p>I will try to get the "American Queen" 
      
      ("spell it with an a," as I once heard Horace Mann say sarcastically) and peruse the
      fury.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad you liked the way I cooked Comstock.</p>
   
   <p>The weather here is very oppressive, and "the weight of the superincumbent hour" is
      hard to bear, together with the load of office work and 
      
      the lassitude and illness that afflict the subscriber. But October will soon be here,
      with healing in his wings.
   </p>
   
   <p>My Jeannie has been very ill this summer, but is getting better, and will go to Providence
      on Friday. She can scarcely walk with weakness, but is on the mend. It has made life
      heavy for me.
   </p>
