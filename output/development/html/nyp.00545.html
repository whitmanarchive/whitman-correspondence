   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00545_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      Answ'd May 25/86. It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service |
      Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Philadelphia, Pa. | Apr | 12 | 1886 | 7 PM |
      Transit; Washington, Rec'd | Apr | 12(?) | 12 PM | 1886 | 1.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00545_n2">2. O'Connor, according to
      his notations on Whitman's letters, did not write to the poet between March 23
      and May 25. Either O'Connor was in error or Whitman had a lapse of
      memory.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00545_n3">3. On  Whitman received $370 from Donaldson and
      $304 from Williams. In his Commonplace Book Whitman noted receiving an
      additional $13 at an unspecified date (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
      The total, according to Whitman, was $687, but in Donaldson's book the amount is
      given as $692. The discrepancy apparently stems from the amount of Donaldson's
      share: he gave it as $375, Whitman as $370. Williams forwarded an additional $8
      on June 11. Whitman read his lecture for the fourth time this year in
      Haddonfield, N.J., on May 18, "without pay, for the benefit of a new Church,
      building fund, at Collingswood" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). For an account of
      the sparsely attended lecture, see <em>Walt Whitman Review</em>, 9
      (1963), 65–66.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00545_n4">4. The item, pasted on the
      first page of the letter, includes the following: "'William D. O'Connor,' says
      the New York <em>Commercial-Advertiser</em> of a former
      Philadelphian, 'is one of the very few clever writers who do not write enough.
      The reason may be that, having a Government position in Washington, the salary
      of which supports him, he has not the need, and without the need the desire for
      composition is perhaps absent.' The same paper, saying that 'Carpenter' is the
      best of Mr. O'Connor's stories, adds: 'It is a story of which Walt Whitman is
      visibly the idealized hero, and it is singularly interesting and
      rememberable.'"<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00545_n5">5. O'Connor's <em>Hamlet's Note-book</em>. On  O'Connor reported to Whitman that "the New York publishers have
      uniformly refused to publish my Baconian reply to R. G. White, even at my
      expense." On  he said that the book was to
      be published by Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Company.<a href="#r5">[back]
