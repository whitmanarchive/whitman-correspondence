   <p>Well, mother dear, New Year has begun—it is the funniest one yet—there is
      a fog as dark as Egypt here, sometimes you cant see a rod before you—it has
      been so for two days steady—very muddy, &amp; spells of drizzling rain—I
      am well &amp; hearty—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am just informed that I am to be transferred over to the Treasury Building, into
      the Solicitor of the Treasury's office (it is in the Department of Justice—is
      a branch of it)<sup><a href="#pml.00032_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Mr.
      Williams,<sup><a href="#pml.00032_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> the new boss, wishes to bring some
      friend of his here—I do not know that I shall dislike the change—I can
      tell better all about it in a week or two—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have applied for a good long leave of absence, to commence about Feb. 1st—I
      shall probably get it, but without pay, (or with only a small part pay)—I am
      willing to take a leave without pay—I want to come home for a while, both to
      be home, &amp; to see about the new edition of my books—I am real well &amp;
      fat &amp; hearty this winter—but I believe I have got a little set against one
      thing &amp; another here, (especially the grub,) &amp; I want a change for a couple
      of months very much—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mama dear, I want to hear about your last week—&amp; George &amp; Lou—I
      sent three letters to you last week, &amp; papers—I knew that policeman
      Doyle<sup><a href="#pml.00032_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> that was shot dead here—he was Peter Doyle's
      brother—I was at the funeral yesterday—it was in the papers I sent
      you—love to you, dear mama—
   </p>

      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I forgot to say Arthur Price<sup><a href="#pml.00032_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> is here, on the iron-clad <em>Mahopac</em>—the vessel is at the navy-yard—expects to sail
      soon—I am going down this afternoon to go on board the ship &amp; see
      him—he is well &amp; hearty.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pml.00032_n1">1. Walt Whitman moved to the
      new office before January 23, 1872; Whitman wrote of his new office in his  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman, saying, "I like this place just as well as the other" but
      bemoaning the overcrowded nature of the office. The official transfer was not
      prepared until March 10, 1873 (National Archives).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00032_n2">2. George Henry Williams
      (1820–1910), U.S. Senator from Oregon, served as Attorney General from
      1871 to 1875. Williams dismissed Walt Whitman on June 30, 1874; Whitman
      "respectfully acknowledged" his dismissal in his  letter to Williams.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00032_n3">3. Francis M. Doyle was
      murdered on December 29, 1871, by Maria Shea, known as "Queen of Louse Alley,"
      when he went to her home to recover a stolen watch and chain. According to the
      Washington <em>Daily Morning Chronicle</em>, Doyle, a native of
      Ireland, was 38, had a wife and three children, and lived at 340 K Street. He
      had been on the police force for four or five years, and had served during the
      War for three years as a fireman on the <em>U.S. Wabash</em>.
      Among the manuscripts at Yale is a draft of an article which Whitman prepared
      for a Washington newspaper to answer criticisms of Doyle for his "arrest of a
      little boy, for theft." Whitman doubted that "the true interests" of the public
      were "aided by this attempt to make martyrs and heroes of the steadily
      increasing swarms of juvenile thieves &amp; vagabonds who infest the streets of
      Washington."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00032_n4">4. Whitman refers to Abby
      Price's son; he wrote of Arthur's visit in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
