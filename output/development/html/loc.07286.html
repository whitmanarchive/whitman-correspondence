   <p>Yours of 20th, dear Walt, came
      yesterday evening. Yes, I am thoroughly satisfied with the big book<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r2">2</a></sup> and more and
      more (if possible) as I look it over. I think it will stand in future ages as the
      cheif glory of the nineteenth century.<sup><a href="#loc.07286_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Yes, I have no
      doubt I get all your letters and papers &amp;c also<sup><a href="#loc.07286_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I shall be very glad to hear of O'C.<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r5">5</a></sup> if you have any
      thing from there to send me—I fear he is very sick, I wrote him lately a
      letter that ought to have been answered and I think would have been if he had been
      able, but it was not—this makes me anxious. No sign of Wm
      Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r6">6</a></sup> and no further letters from him. No sleighing so far,
      we have had a few days cold but mild again today—not much of a winter so far.
      All goes quietly here, we are preparing for Xmas.
   </p>
   
   <p>What will you have for your Xmas dinner? Roast turkey and plum pudding is the regular
      thing here but you will hardly be up to that this year. But by new year I am in
      hopes you will be in pretty fair shape again. The sun is out warm and
      bright—looks almost like a spring day out doors. From the two far corners of
      my office (where I am sitting) the 1st &amp; 2d heads<sup><a href="#loc.07286_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup> look down upon me grandly &amp; calmly.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4151">2. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n2002">5. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n4284">6. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
