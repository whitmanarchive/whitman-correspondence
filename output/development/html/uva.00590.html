   <p>Yours came to-day &amp; I have sent this evn'g: five copies of the big book<sup><a href="#n6155" id="r1">1</a></sup> by
      Express, unpaid, in a package, (nearly one foot thick, two broad, brown paper wrapt)
      to be call'd for at Adams's Central office, Boston—you ought to get it Saturday
      even'g or Monday—please pay the freight &amp; I will return it you—There
      is no special hurry ab't delivering the books—the main thing is I want to be
      sure they get to their destined names—Each one is named on the

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n6155">1. Whitman is referring to his <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em>, which had just been
      published.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="har.00049_n3">2. Elizabeth Fairchild was
      the wife of Colonel Charles Fairchild, the president of a paper company, to whom
      Whitman sent the Centennial Edition on March 2, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). He mailed her husband a
      copy of <em>Progress</em> in April, 1881, shortly after his visit
      to Boston, where he probably met the Fairchilds for the first time (Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6000">3. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="uva.00590_n1">4. Hamlin Garland
      (1860–1940) was an American writer best known for his fiction about the
      Midwest. He strongly endorsed Whitman's work, and he frequently wrote and
      lectured about him. Whitman misspells Garland's name as "Harland." For more on
      Garland's relationship to Whitman, see Thomas K. Dean, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_190.html">Garland, Hamlin</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0915">5. Franklin B. Sanborn
      (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
      he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
      the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
      reviewed <em>Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Boston
         Commonwealth</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00059.html">February 24, 1866</a>. He was editor of the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
      his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
      appeared without Sanborn's name in the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K. Walker,
      "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_206.html">Sanborn, Franklin Benjamin (Frank) (1831–1917)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">6. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">7. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
