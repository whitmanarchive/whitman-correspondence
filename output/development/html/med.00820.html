      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Presumptuous as it may be, I cannot refrain from sending these few lines to you from
      the old country to thank you for the new life your poems have given to me. Since
      reading them—and I have read them again and again—especially the Leaves
      of Grass, I have felt conscious of a new vista opening before me. I am only
      twenty-three—yet I feel as if the past few years (breaking away gradually, as
      I have been, from surroundings orthodox and conventional) were long eras of
      indifference and lethargy. How delightful to feel that there are such great
      possibilities in life! All my sceptical rejection of creeds and dogmas is giving
      place to a sense of the eternal fitness of things. In my blind unreasoning egotism
      I
      mistook the shadow for the substance, and thought that "religion" was what is
      preached from the orthodox pulpit and practiced in the city. And then I came upon
      two lines of your Leaves of Grass:
   </p>
   
   
    "I swear the earth shall surely be complete to
   <br> him or her who shall be complete!
   <br> I swear the earth remains jagged and broken only
   <br> to him or her who remains broken and jagged!"
   <br>
   
   
   
   <p>I wish I could explain to you in what way they touched as with a magnet some latent
      chord. And yet I feel there is no need to explain anything. <em>You
         will understand</em>.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have already reached across the water and clasped your hand. I have found something
      deeper and more precious to me than your printed words. I am looking forward
      hopefully and joyfully to a future which shall not be lacking in strength.
   </p>
   
   <p>Forgive my illogical desultory manner of writing. I think you will understand all
      I
      would convey. The little picture of your home life in Specimen Days has so much
      interested me. Now I feel as if I knew you in the flesh as well as in the spirit.
      Accept the grateful thanks of yours faithfully.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Little is known about Louisa
      Snowden. Whitman told Horace Traubel that she was "one of the beautiful
      unknowns" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
