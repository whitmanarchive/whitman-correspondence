      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours duly received<sup><a href="#loc.00445_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &nbsp;I have had so many things to attend to lately that I have not been able to get time
      to answer and can only do so now so that you may know that I hav'nt forgotten you
   </p>
   
   <p>We are still at work getting out specifications for the settling Reservoirs<sup><a href="#loc.00445_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—a job of about $700 000—and of course we feel mighty anxious to cover all points
      so that we wont be upset by any sharp practice
   </p>
   
   
   <p>On the street to-day I saw a very interesting yet somewhat painful sight—twas that
      of a family moving in from the plains—An old woman—I shoud judge all of eighty—another woman of about 35—a young man and his wife abt 25 a boy of 12 two children 8 and 6 and a little babe—all but the young man and his
      wife were in the wagon drawn by 4 oxen—the wagon covered with dirty white canvass—The
      boy had leading with a rope a fine old cow—a young cow and calf were alongside—under
      the wagon was a large white dog and inside by the old woman was a small black terrier—They
      had met with an accident in the way of b[r]eaking one of the hind wheels and were therefore hard up—The faces
      of all were a study—but particularly of the young man and his wife—neither of them
      was at all handsome but yet I shall remember their faces for a long time—The old woman
      had that peculiar look of crazy stupidity that you can hardly tell whether they are
      really stupid or thinking of by-gone life &nbsp;The talk of the crowd was that they had
      been driven in by the Indians—but I doubt that part of the story—
   </p>
   
   <p>There is a report in town to-day that some of the "bloody injuns" were stealing cows &amp;c just outside town—about where we propose to set our pumping engines—Of course I suppose its all humbug—but yet cannot
      see what such a detailed statement as is in the paper this morning is printed for—<sup><a href="#loc.00445_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I had a letter from Mother a few days ago—she appears to be getting along middling
      well yet I wish she could get a better place to live—<sup><a href="#loc.00445_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>From a letter received from Mat to-day she is having a first rate time yet—I wish
      you would write her—address care of G. F. Mason,<sup><a href="#loc.00445_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Towanda, Give my regards to Mr &amp; Mrs O'Conner<sup><a href="#loc.00445_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> and friends that I met in Washington—
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you may be able to carry out your idea and come out to see us—</p>
   
   <p>good by for the present &nbsp;write me as often as you can</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00445_n1">1. Whitman's
      letter of about August 1 is not extant.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00445_n2">2. Located at
      Bissell's Point, three and a half miles north of city hall.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00445_n3">3. The first
      reports of this incident were, as Jeff says, "humbug." Forty Winnebago Indians
      returning by steamboat to their tribal lands in Wisconsin had stopped for a few
      days in St. Louis and temporarily encamped near the Bissell's Point works (<em>Missouri Republican</em>, August 2 and 3, 1867).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00445_n4">4. After
      Jeff's family left Brooklyn, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman gave up the house at 840
      Pacific Street and in July moved to a new house at 1194 Atlantic Avenue. She
      complained of the small rooms and the "bad smells" from the sewer (see the
      letter from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman of ).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00445_n5">5. Gordon F.
      Mason, father of Jeff's old friend Julius Mason from the Brooklyn Water Works
      (see the letter from Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman of , and <em>Mattie:
         The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em>, ed. Randall H. Waldron [New
      York: New York University Press, 1977], 37). Mattie and the children lived with
      the Masons in Towanda, Pennsylvania, until mid-September 1867, when she and the
      girls returned to Brooklyn.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00445_n6">6. For William
      Douglas O'Connor, see the letter from Thomas Jefferson Whitman to William
      Douglas O'Connor of . Jeff had
      visited Walt Whitman and the O'Connors in February 1867 (Gay Wilson Allen, (<em>The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</em>
      [New York: Macmillan, 1955; rev. ed., New York University Press, 1967],
