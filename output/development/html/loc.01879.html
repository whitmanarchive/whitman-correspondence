      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received with thanks, &amp; read with much interest, the article by Mr. Hinton<sup><a href="#n0305" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
      wh.
      
       you sent me. Besides Mr. Hinton's own share in the article, I was
      particularly glad to see in full Emerson's<sup><a href="#n0218" id="r2">2</a></sup> letter written on
      the first appearance of Leaves of Grass. Of this
      I had hitherto only seen an expression or two extracted.
   </p>
   
   <p>Will you allow me to respond by sending two English notices of the selection. The
      one
      in the Academia I find is written by a Mr. Robertson<sup><a href="#n0513" id="r3">3</a></sup> whom I
      have met occasionally—a Scotchman of acute intellectual sympathies. The
      alterations noted in ink in his article are reproduced by me from the copy 
      wh.
      
       he
      himself sent me: I infer that they are in conformity with the original 
      Ms.
      
      , but cut out by a less ardent editor. The Sunday
      Times
      is edited by a Mr. Knight<sup><a href="#n0336" id="r4">4</a></sup>, of whom also I have some slight
      personal knowledge. I think the review in that paper is very likely done by Mr.
      Knight himself. The Academia is a recently started paper, chiefly scholastic, and
      I
      suppose of a restricted circulation. The Sunday Times has no doubt a very large
      circulation, and a good standing among weekly newspapers—not being however a
      specially <em>literary</em> organ.
   </p>
   
   <p>You will, I think, have seen through Mr. Conway<sup><a href="#n0170" id="r5">5</a></sup> the notice, also
      eulogistic, in the London Review<sup><a href="#n0360" id="r6">6</a></sup>.
      I am told of a hostile one in the Express (evening edition of the Daily News) but
      have now  seen it: the Morning Star<sup><a href="#n0421" id="r7">7</a></sup> (the
      paper most closely connected with John Bright<sup><a href="#n0104" id="r8">8</a></sup>) had a very
      handsome notice about a week ago—but, like all literary reviews in that paper,
      a brief one. These are all the notices I know of at present. Perhaps I ought to
      apologize for saying so much to you about a matter which I know plays but the
      smallest part in your thought and interest as a poet.
   </p>
   
   <p>As to the sale of the book I really know nothing as yet—not having once seen
      the publisher since the volume was issued.
   </p>
   
   <p>A glance at the Sunday Times notice recalls to my attention a sentence therein which
      I should perhaps refer to—about your having given express sanction &amp;c.
      Where the writer gets this from I know not—certainly not from me: indeed the
      P.S. to the selection asserts the exact contrary, and I have not so much as seen Mr.
      Knight for (I dare say) a couple of years.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With warmest regard and friendship,
      <br></br>yours
      <br></br>W. M. Rossetti<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n0522" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>"That was twenty years ago," said W., "and Rossetti is still serving under the
      flag—a pirate flag, somebody said: but it is hardly that: it is more like
      the red flag—the flag of revolution. The best of Rossetti is in the
      natural way he takes this whole Leaves of Grass business, without apologizing
      for, without glorifying, me."

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0305">1. Richard J. Hinton (1830–1901) was born in
      London and came to the U. S. in 1851. He trained as a printer, and, like James
      Redpath (with whom Walt Whitman corresponded on ), went to Kansas and joined John Brown. In fact, but for an
      accident he would have been with Brown at Harper's Ferry. A man mistaken for
      Hinton was hanged. With Redpath, Hinton was the author of <em>Hand-book to Kansas Territory and the Rocky Mountains' Gold Region</em>
      (1859). Later he wrote <em>Rebel Invasion of Missouri and
         Kansas</em> (1865) and <em>John Brown and His Men</em> (1894).
      Apparently Hinton had suggested that Thayer &amp; Eldridge print <em>Leaves of Grass</em>; see the <em>New
         Voice</em>, XVI (4 February 1899), 2. Hinton served in the Union Army from 1861
      to 1865, and saw Whitman while lying wounded in a hospital, a scene which he
      described in the Cincinnati <em>Commercial</em> on August 26,
      1871. After the war Hinton wrote for many newspapers. He defended O'Connor's <em>The Good Gray Poet</em> in the Milwaukee <em>Sentinel</em> on February 9, 1866. Hinton's article in the Rochester <em>Evening Express</em> on March 7, 1868, was a lengthy account
      of Walt Whitman's "Fame and Fortunes in England and America," with quotations
      from O'Connor and Burroughs. Obviously pleased, Walt Whitman sent it to friends,
      including Rossetti, who acknowledged it on . See Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], 2:396; William Sloane Kennedy, <em>The Fight of a Book for the World</em> (West Yarmouth, MA:
      Stonecroft Press, 1926), 19, 67, 110–111, 242; the Boston <em>Transcript</em>, December 21, 1901.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0218">2. Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) was an
      American poet and essayist who began the Transcendentalist movement with his
      1836 essay <em>Nature</em>. On , Whitman informed Ralph Waldo Emerson that "" was "put in type for my own convenience,
      and to ensure greater correctness." He asked Emerson to take the poem to James
      T. Fields, editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, who promptly
      accepted it and published it in February 1869. For more on Emerson, see Jerome
      Loving, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_1.html">Emerson, Ralph Waldo [1809–1882]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0513">3. On ,
      William Michael Rossetti informed Walt Whitman that this review had been
      composed by a Mr. Robertson, "a Scotchman of acute intellectual sympathies."
      Rossetti had restored the passages "cut out by a less ardent Editor" (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], 2:123).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0336">4. John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0170">5. Moncure Daniel Conway (1832–1907) was an
      American abolitionist and frequent correspondent with Walt Whitman. Conway often
      acted as Whitman's agent and occasional public relations man in England. For
      more on Conway, see Philip W. Leon, ""<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_182.html">Conway Moncure Daniel (1832–1907)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998), 148.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0360">6. William James Linton (1812–1897), British-born
      wood engraver, came to the U. S. in 1867 and settled near New Haven, Conn. He
      illustrated the works of Whittier, Longfellow, Bryant, and others, wrote the
      "indispensable" <em>History of Wood-Engraving in America</em>
      (1882), and edited <em>Poetry of America, 1776–1876</em>
      (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Walt Whitman's poems as well as his
      picture. Linton's engraving of Walt Whitman appeared in the 1876 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, in <em>Complete Poems
         &amp; Prose</em> (1888–1889), and in <em>The Complete
         Writings of Walt Whitman</em> (1902), 10 vols., II, 156; it inspired the
      poem "Out from Behind This Mask." See Harold Blodgett, "Whitman and the Linton
      Portrait," <em>Walt Whitman Newsletter</em>, IV (1958),
      90–92. According to his <em>Threescore and Ten Years, 1820
         to 1890—Recollections</em> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Walt
      Whitman in Washington and later visited him in Camden, which Whitman reported in
      his , letter to Peter Doyle: "I
      liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, ... a true poet
      who could not write poetry, much of wilfulness accounting for his neglect of
      form." His obituary in the New York <em>Times</em> of January 8,
      1898, called Linton "the greatest wood engraver of his time, an artist in other
      senses, and a poet of no mean ability."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0421">7. Founded in 1856 by British politicians John Bright
      (1811–1889) and Richard Cobden (1804–1865), the <em>Morning Star </em> was a London daily newspaper oriented toward radical
      politics and in support of peace. On , William Michael Rossetti also noted that the <em>Morning Star</em> "had a very handsome notice ... but like all literary
      reviews in that paper a brief one" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1996],
      2:124).<a href="#r7">[back]
