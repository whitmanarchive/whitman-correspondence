   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00557_n7">1. This letter dates to no
      earlier than November 30, 1868 and no later than December 3, 1868. Richard
      Maurice Bucke dated the letter to December 1, 1868, and Edwin Haviland Miller
      also assigned the letter the date of December 1, 1868 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:366). The letter addresses multiple family matters in common
      with other letters from late 1868 that are consistent with Bucke's and Miller's
      month and day: Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's presence in Brooklyn after
      arriving from St. Louis in late November, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's daughter
      Hannah (Whitman) Heyde's recent thumb surgery, and the diminishing probability
      that Jeff and his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman will visit Walt Whitman
      in Washington. Louisa had mentioned Jeff and Mattie's possible trip to
      Washington in her  letter to
      Walt, so this letter's update that their trip was no longer probable dates this
      letter a week after that November 25 letter. Also, Louisa's  letter to Walt,
      which offers further details about Hannah's thumb problems from Heyde's letter,
      is most likely to follow this one.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00557_n13">2. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman
      (1823–1908), Walt Whitman's sister. They lived in Burlington, Vermont.
      Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor
      treatment of Hannah.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00557_n12">3. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Walter Whitman, Sr., and
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. She resided in Burlington, Vermont, with her husband
      Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. The relationship
      between Hannah and Charles was difficult and marred with quarrels and disease.
      Louisa often spoke disparagingly of Charles in her letters to Walt Whitman. For
      the Whitman family's bitterness toward Charles and the stress that Hannah's
      health crisis introduced between Louisa and her son George, see Horace Traubel,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.70.html">Wednesday, January 9, 1889</a>, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> (New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914), 3:499–500.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00557_n8">4. For the condition of Hannah
      Heyde's thumb, which had been lanced during a surgery in November by Dr. Samuel
      Thayer and would be amputated in December, see Charles L. Heyde's December 1868
      letter to Louisa (Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His
         Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949],
      225–226).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00557_n6">5. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      switched subjects from daughter Hannah Heyde's thumb infection to Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's possible trip to
      Washington. Louisa had written in her  letter to Walt Whitman that "Jeff and she talks of coming to
      washington for a few days the first of next week Jeff will write to inform you
      what day they will come)."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00557_n9">6. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. Mattie had arrived in Brooklyn from St. Louis for medical treatment
      and a holiday visit in mid-October 1868. Jeff joined his wife and children near
      the end of November, and they returned to St. Louis in mid-December. At the time
      of this letter, Mattie was being treated for the throat ailment that will lead
      to her death in 1873. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed.,
      "Introduction," <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r6">[back]
