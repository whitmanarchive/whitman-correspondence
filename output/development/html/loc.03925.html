   <p>I will send Herbert's<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> letter<sup><a href="#loc.03925_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> just

       this morning &amp; add a word myself. 
      Tho'
      
       I have nothing new to say particular—I am comfortable &amp; 
      ab't
      
       the same generally in health, (but slowly going down hill I suppose.) Ed<sup><a href="#n0589c" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      was here an hour or so last evening, &amp; we were glad to have him. Wish <u>you</u> would come &amp; spend the day here—wish George<sup><a href="#n0852c" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      would come &amp; you &amp; he have dinner here with us—Can't you fix a day
      soon? Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r6">6</a></sup> would be glad too—As I write the little bird is singing gayly
      in his cage—first rate cheer &amp; company for me, for I am here mostly
      alone—sun shining to day here, but cold enough outside frozen hard—"O why
      past there 
      bleach'd
      
       these locks, old Time yet left my heart so young"?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).

   <p id="n0262">2. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <p id="loc.03925_n1">3. In a letter dated , Gilchrist informed Walt Whitman that he
      had included in the biography of his mother an account of some conversations at
      the Stafford farm. He also asked specifically about Susan Stafford. In the same
      letter Gilchrist sent a gift of £3 from Miss R. E. Powell of Guildford,
      England. The poet visited the Staffords on January 23 when the weather was
      milder (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
