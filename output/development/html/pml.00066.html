   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Dr. S. Weir Mitchell
      (1829–1914) was a specialist in nervous disorders as well as a poet and a
      novelist. On April 18, Whitman had his second interview with Dr. Mitchell, who
      attributed his earlier paralysis to a small rupture of a blood vessel in the
      brain but termed Whitman's heart "normal and healthy." Whitman also noted that
      "the <em>bad spells</em> [Mitchell] tho't recurrences by <em>habit</em> (? sort of automatic)" (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Mitchell was the first physician to
      indicate the psychosomatic nature of many of Whitman's ailments. Probably the
      impending lecture on the death of Lincoln unconsciously brought back the
      emotional involvements of his hospital experiences with comrades whom he had
      come to love only to be separated from them.
