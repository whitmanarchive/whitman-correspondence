      <br></br><br></br>Dear Herbert Gilchrist
      
   </p>
   
   <p><u>The book</u> came two days ago, &amp; I have been looking over
      all of it, &amp; reading a great part minutely—Surely it has been done well,
      &amp; is a beautiful &amp; (in one sense) sufficient memorial of the noblest mother
      &amp; woman. It appeals to my printer-sense too—is a handsome &amp; generous
      piece of typography &amp; mechanical book making, with its excellent paper &amp;
      press work—Thank you indeed dear H. for sending me an early copy<sup><a href="#upa.00085_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—George and Susan Stafford<sup><a href="#n0852d" id="r2">2</a></sup> are
      still at Glendale—Debby and Jo<sup><a href="#upa.00085_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> have gone to
      Kansas—I was there last Sunday afternoon—they are well as
      usual—Harry has had a surgical operation on his throat. He now comes up from
      Marlton, (or Glendale) every day, to have the doctor watch &amp; dress it—is a
      little reduced in flesh &amp; blood, but is getting along well—Ed and Van and George are
      well—Mont<sup><a href="#upa.00085_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> is married<sup><a href="#upa.00085_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup>—(I went down Sunday to G to take him Harry home, at his request)—I am
      still here in my shanty in Mickle street—probably <u>let
         down a peg or two</u> from when I saw you last, but not much
      different—mentally the same—physically a sad wreck—I am reciting my
      "Death of Abraham Lincoln" lecture<sup><a href="#med.00796_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> when I get a call—(as this is the
      season)—go on to New York for that purpose April 14, if I can get
      there—had a good visit from Chas Rowley<sup><a href="#upa.00085_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup> of
      Manchester yesterday—I am well as usual—Love to you—Spring is
      tardy here—My canary is singing blithely as I write—
