   <p>Your letter to Han was recd and duly 
      deliverd
      
      . She is I think, better than for a long time
      past. Only one new 
      vargary
      
       has originated with her, and that is that I shall go away; rent the house to
      her, and she will take boarders; there is but one step from this to insanity—
   </p>
   
   <p>Han has an idea that she could accomplish that for 3 or 4 persons, easily, which she
      has, under no circumstances, done for me, not ten times in as many years. I have just
      taken up a note against the property: and I think that with reasonable success I may
      clear it all, by next Spring. But the idea that Han runs the house and I am but the
      secondary drudge must be 
      dismissd
      
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I see but one way to bring this matter into a 
      realizistic
      
       shape or condition, and that is, to take her at her word; "to go away" and put
      the place and herself under the guardianship of an attorney.
   </p>
   
   <p>Much of this difficulty has arisen from the miserable teachings of her mother, who
      enjoined upon her, when we were first married not to perform these little services
      for
      me, which 
      naturaly
      
       would suggest themselves to a kind and considerate wife, and endear her to her
      husband: Because I might be 
      spoild
      
      , by it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mrs Whitman has been toward me, a silly old woman—for why I do not know—I
      never was under obligations to her for anything. If she brought a half loaf of bread
      to
      my house, she took butter or tea away in return for it, and I never had a meal at
      her
      table that I did not pay for. But Mrs Whitman never did possess a particle of honest frankness—on the
      contrary, in one instance, I will not her[e] mention, a more than mean, a wicked
      duplicity toward myself.
   </p>
   
   <p>Perhaps I would not look upon "Leaves of Grass" with so much melancholy regard, if
      I was
      not experiencing a practical version of it: Irregular—disorderly: indifferent or
      defiant—the lower animal instincts—no accountability. no moral sense or
      principle—No true, inherent, practical sympathy for anything; myself;
      disappointments, or endeavours. Nothing of me, or of the future to arise for me, out
      of
      my labour, and progressions.
   </p>
   
   <p>Han has no more moral sense of marriage than an Ethiopian, of the field—Gives
      herself to a man and
      nothing more—Your letters and those of her friends shall be 
      allways
      
       forwarded to her. I am simply disgusted with so much selfishness—

   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>There is one more change, to the last notion of Han's, and that is "She" can go
      "home," and cook for her mother: "her mother said so." She sometimes says that she
      has no friends. I believe it, since this "home" is offrd, in a menial capacity, and
      the service that is imagined can be extracted from her. My idea was, that, if I did
      go to Europe, "to let her board, in the most comfortable manner, and raise herself
      from ill health and drudgery—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a French-born
      landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman (1823–1890), Walt
      Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_96.html">Heyde, Charles Louis (1822–1892)</a>," <em>Walt
