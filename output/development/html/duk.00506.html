   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00506_n7">1. This letter dates to October
      22, 1867. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated this letter "22 October," and Richard
      Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1867. Bucke's date is correct because the letter
      asks about the publication of Walt Whitman's article "Democracy" in the <em>Galaxy</em> and discusses Louisa's anxiety about Walt's
      health—"thought you was sick" (see also her  letter to Walt).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00506_n11">2. The letter that Walt
      Whitman sent on October 8, 1867 is not extant, but he may have reported to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman his recent completion of the essay "Democracy" for the
      <em>Galaxy</em>. In her  letter, she referred to the letter that she received from Walt,
      which is undoubtedly the same as "your last the 9th." The one-day discrepancy
      (her 8th and 9th) is because the letter was sent by Walt on October 8 and
      received by Louisa on October 9.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00506_n9">3. The word is "c[h]ristmas,"
      but Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote the letters "crist" over the first five
      letters of the holiday that precedes Christmas, Thanksgiving, which President
      Andrew Johnson proclaimed would be held on Thursday, November 28, 1867. Walt
      Whitman made a visit to Brooklyn a few days after this letter. In his  letter to Alfred Pratt, Whitman
      wrote that he had "been home to Brooklyn, N. Y., on a visit to my
      mother."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00502_n3">5. The nickname "Sis" refers to
      Jessie Louisa Whitman (1863–1957), the daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Jessie and her sister Manahatta "Hattie" were both favorites of
      their uncle Walt. The nickname "Sis" was given first to Manahatta but was passed
      to her younger sister Jessie Louisa when Manahatta became "Hattie."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00440_n3">6. Manahatta Whitman
      (1860–1886), known as "Hattie," was the daughter of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven years of her life in
      the same home with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was especially close to her
      grandmother. Hattie and her younger sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957) were
      both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">7. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00506_n6">8. Though the letter that Walt
      Whitman sent to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman on October 8, 1867 is not extant (see
      Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland
      Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:370), he may have
      reported to his mother his recent completion of the essay "Democracy" (<em>Galaxy</em> 4 [December 1867], 919–933). "Democracy" is
      reprinted in <em>Democratic Vistas</em> (1871). Whitman announced
      the completion of "Democracy" to Francis P. Church and William C. Church in his
       letter and promised to
      forward the manuscript the following week.<a href="#r8">[back]
