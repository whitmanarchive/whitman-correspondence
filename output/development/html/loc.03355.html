   <p>I have for many years, I have harkened for 
      a letter from you. Can you write me 
      three or four lines? (It is not for the
      mere autograph I seek.)

   <p>My friend Carpenter—one of
      your best friends—has sent me a copy
      of his "Songs of [

      two pieces from you works. I suppose
      you have got a copy.

   <p>The verses I enclose were written 
      by a journeyman boiler-maker, in 1871.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Harrison Riley
      (1835–1907) was a British socialist who addressed Whitman as "My dear
      Friend and Master" in a letter on . Twelve
      years earlier he had found a copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> "and
      saw a Revelation.... In all my troubles and successes I have been strengthened
      by your divine teachings" (<em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin
      Haviland Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1964], 3:148 n17).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3013">1. John Ruskin (1819–1900) was
      one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
      via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
      of ). Ruskin, according to Whitman,
      expressed "<em>worry</em> [...] that [<em>Leaves</em> is] <em>too personal</em>, too emotional,
      launched from the fires of [...] spinal passions, joys, yearnings" (see the
      letter from Whitman to William O'Connor of ). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my
      Ruskin with some qualifications." Still, Ruskin "is not to be made little of: is
      of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.4.html">Thursday, January 24, 1889</a>).<a href="#r1">[back]
