   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00570_n1">1. This letter dates to
      August 22 or 23, 1863. Edwin Haviland Miller dated the letter to August
      16–25?, 1863 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:137; 1:373), but a
      more narrow range can be assigned.<br><br>
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had received George Washington Whitman's  letter from near Covington,
      Kentucky, and she forwarded George's letter to Walt with this letter. Walt
      Whitman acknowledged receipt of George's letter and "your lines" on August
      24 (see his  letter to Louisa).
      Walt, who was pleased that George was "back to Kentucky," received George's
      letter with this one from Louisa because his remark echoes George's phrase
      "again back to old Kaintuck" (see George's  letter to Louisa). Walt also responded to this letter's
      discussion of Andrew Jackson Whitman's illness and the possibility that
      George's money could help aid Andrew to take a trip recommended by a
      physician.

   <p id="duk.00570_n7">2. This letter from Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman is inscribed on George Washington Whitman's  letter to Louisa. George Washington
      Whitman (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the
      Union Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War.
      He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was
      taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the
      war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with
      a partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up
      a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00570_n2">3. "Mother, you may expect to
      get 175 or 180 dollars nearly as soon as you receive this" (see George
      Washington Whitman's  letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman). The preceding Wednesday, the day Louisa she received
      George's letter, was August 19, 1863.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00570_n3">4. George Washington Whitman
      generally forwarded money from Kentucky via Adams Express, a packet and letter
      service that was founded in the northeast in the 1840s and spread nationally.
      Adams Express was noted for its trustworthiness and its guarantee of privacy for
      shippers, which made it a favorite for conveying material that was deemed
      valuable or otherwise called for discretion. The Whitmans use Adams Express to
      transfer larger sums of money (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). For more on
      the trust accorded to Adams Express, see Hollis Robbins, "Fugitive Mail: The
      Deliverance of Henry 'Box' Brown and Antebellum Postal Politics," (<em>American Studies</em> 50.1/2 [2009], 12–13).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">5. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n18">6. Andrew Jackson Whitman
      (1827–1863) was Walter Whitman, Sr., and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son
      and Walt Whitman's brother. In the early 1860s, Andrew worked as a carpenter,
      and he enlisted briefly in the Union Army during the Civil War (see Martin G.
      Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 10 [Winter 1993],
      142–8). He developed a drinking problem that contributed to his early
      death, leaving behind his wife Nancy McClure Whitman, pregnant with son Andrew,
      Jr., and their two sons, George "Georgy" and James "Jimmy." For Andrew's family
      after his death, see Jerome Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> (Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975), 13–14.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00570_n5">7. Whether Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman asked George Washington Whitman if she could spend some of his money to
      permit Andrew Jackson Whitman to take the proposed trip to Rockland Lake is not
      known, but Louisa provided money for Andrew to take two trips in late August. A
      few weeks earlier, Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman had conveyed a physician's
      opinion that Andrew must "go out from the seashore if he wants to get well."
      Jeff also sought Walt Whitman's advice: "Andrew wants to go but dont know where
      to go or how to leave his family" (see Jeff's  letter to Walt). In addition, Andrew sought treatment from an
      Italian doctor on Court Street who recommended baths (see George's  letter to Louisa).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00570_n6">8. Rockland Lake is an elevated
      lake on the western shore of the Hudson River, about 45 miles north of Brooklyn.
      It was a recreational area that also served as a source for ice in the city of
      New York (see Addison T. Richards, <em>Appletons' Illustrated
         Hand-book of American Travel</em> [New York: Appleton, 1860], 125). Andrew
      took a late-August trip to Freehold, New Jersey, that Louisa characterized as a
      drinking spree (see her  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00611_n3">9. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a French-born landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa
      Whitman (1823–1908), Walt's sister, in
      1852.
      <a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n4">10. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00570_n18">11. The postscript is inverted
      on the top of the page. Manahatta "Hattie" Whitman (1860–1886) was the
      elder daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman. Though Louisa Van Velsor Whitman was at times irritated with childcare
      responsibilities, she became very close to Hattie, who lived most of the first
      seven years of her life in the same home with her grandmother. Hattie and her
      sister Jessie Louisa were both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r11">[back]
