      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Walt Whitman: 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am grieved to hear that
      you have been so unwell and can only trust that your physician is a true prophet,
      and that you will recover and be as well as ever. I have myself known a case of
      cerebral anæmia in a young lady living near me. She lost her mind and no one
      who saw her believed she could live; but under the superintendence of a good doctor
      she has perfectly recovered and looks plumper and fresher than ever she did
      before.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This is the first letter I have written for weeks, and I am afraid I write rather
      obscurely, for my hand and arm have been crippled with rheumatism (I hope it is not
      gout), and I am not yet perfectly recovered.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was beholden to you for your Democratic Vistas, and if I did not answer and acknowledge them I regret to have
      done so; but if you knew how great the mass of my correspondence is, and how much
      I
      dislike letter-writing, I doubt not, you would forgive me easily.
   </p>
   
   <p>When I next hear of or from you may the news be that you are fully re-established
      in
      your old vigor and body: Meanwhile believe me
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.
