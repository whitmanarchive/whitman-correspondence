      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of Sunday night came this morning—it seems indeed "after a storm
      comes a calm"—You must have had quite an exciting week—still I think it
      must have been kind of good to have had George and Lou home<sup><a href="#n1046" id="r1">1</a></sup>—was Lou as kind and helpful as ever? About being alone, if you feel as I do
      about it, it is a satisfaction to be by one's self, as you grow old—(though
      perhaps not too much)—I was glad to hear about little Jim &amp; Georgey<sup><a href="#pml.00036_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I am glad the Stantons<sup><a href="#pml.00036_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      are gone—they would only have been a continual nuisance—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mama, I shall come home, (if nothing happens more than at present known) and stay
      two
      months, &amp; then return here to my place—I shall write in good time
      before—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mama dear, you must try to take as much comfort as you can—I hope Gracie<sup><a href="#pml.00036_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> comes in frequently—&amp; Mrs. Mormon
      too—(she seems to me a good neighbor)—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1046">1. Whitman's brother, George
      Washington Whitman, and his wife Louisa Orr Haslam (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00036_n1">2. If Walt Whitman was
      replying to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's , his remarks about Andrew's children were inappropriate, for
      his mother described how George—"i think he is a very bad boy
      indeed"—came to beg, and also informed her son that Nancy, Andrew's wife,
      "said in the letter i could take george if i wanted too." According to a letter
      from Mannahatta, Jeff's daughter, to her grandmother on October 26, 1872
      (Library of Congress) George was killed in an accident later in the year.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00036_n2">3. The Stantons lived
      downstairs; according to Walt Whitman's  letter to Thomas Jefferson Whitman, George "turned 'em out for
      impudence to mother."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00036_n3">4. Whitman refers to Grace
      B. Haight. Evidently Whitman forgot, or did not know, that Haight, the daughter
      of the Bruces (a couple mentioned in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman), was in
      Independence, Iowa, whence she wrote to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman on February 7,
      1872 (Library of Congress). After her return to Brooklyn, she wrote to Whitman's
      mother on September 22, 1872 (Library of Congress) and to Whitman on September
      26, 1872 (Library of Congress). Haight and the Bruces visited Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman at Camden the day after Thanksgiving; see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      December 3, 1871 letter to Walt Whitman (Library of Congress).<a href="#r4">[back]
