   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="nyp.00676_n2">3. The <em>Saturday Review of Poetics, Literature, Science, and Art</em> on March 2,
      1889, was not nearly so intemperate as Whitman alleged; it would have none of
      the excesses of O'Connor and Bucke, but the final paragraph was not without
      point: "No; let us, if it be ours to lecture on poetry, hold up Walt Whitman as
      much as any one pleases for an awful example of the fate that waits, and justly
      waits, on those who think (idle souls!) that there is such a thing as progress
      in poetry, and that because you have steam-engines and other things which
      Solomon and Sappho had not, you may, nay must, neglect the lessons of Sappho and
      Solomon. But let us none the less confess that this strayed reveller, this
      dubiously well-bred truant in poetry, is a poet still, and one of the remarkably
      few poets that his own country has produced." An earlier notice of Whitman
      appeared in the journal on May 2, 1868 (see footnote 6 to Whitman's letter to
      John Camden Hotten of .<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
