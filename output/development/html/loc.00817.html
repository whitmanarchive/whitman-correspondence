      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter &amp; sent the one you sent for George immediately—he must have got
      it the next day—I had got one from him before yours arrived—I mean to go to Annapolis
      &amp; see him—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, we expect a commencement of the fighting below very soon, there is every indication
      of it—we have had about as severe rain storms here lately as I ever see—it is middling
      pleasant now—there are exciting times in Congress<sup><a href="#loc.00817_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—the Copperheads are getting furious, &amp; want to recognize the Southern Confederacy—this
      is a pretty time to talk of recognizing such villains after what they have done, and after what has transpired the last three years—After first Fredericksburgh
      I felt discouraged myself, &amp; doubted whether our rulers could carry on the war—but
      that has past away, the war <em>must</em> be carried on—&amp; I would willingly go myself in the ranks if I thought it would profit
      more than at present, &amp; I don't know sometimes but I shall as it is—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, you dont know what a feeling a man gets after being in the active sights &amp; influences of the
      camp, the Army, the wounded &amp;c.—he gets to have a deep feeling he never experienced
      before<sup><a href="#loc.00817_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—the flag, the tune of Yankee Doodle, &amp; similar things, produce an effect on a fellow never such before—I have seen some bring tears on the
      men's cheeks, &amp; others turn pale, under such circumstances<sup><a href="#loc.00817_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I have a little flag (it belonged to one of our cavalry reg'ts) presented to me by
      one of the wounded—it was taken by the secesh in a cavalry fight, &amp; rescued by our
      men in a bloody little skirmish, it cost three men's lives, just to get one little
      flag, four by three—our men rescued it, &amp; tore it from the breast of a dead rebel—all
      that just for the name of getting their little banner back again—this man that got
      it was very badly wounded, &amp; they let him keep it—I was with him a good deal, he wanted to give me something he said, he didn't expect
      to live, so he gave me the little banner as a keepsake—I mention this, Mother, to
      show you a specimen of the feeling—there isn't a reg't, cavalry or infantry, that
      wouldn't do the same, on occasion—
   </p>
   
   <p>Tuesday morning April 12th
      Mother, I will finish my letter this morning—it is a beautiful day to-day—I was up
      in Congress very late last night,<sup><a href="#loc.00817_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> the house had a very excited night session about expelling the men that want to recognize
      the Southern Confederacy—You ought to hear the soldiers talk—they are excited to madness—we
      shall probably have hot times here not in the Army alone—the soldiers are true as
      the north star—I send you a couple of envelopes, &amp; one to George—Write how you are,
      dear Mother, &amp; all the rest—I want to see you all—Jeff, my dear brother, I wish you
      was here, &amp; Mat too—Write how sis is—I am well as usual, indeed first rate every way—I
      want to come on in a month, &amp; try to print my "Drum Taps"<sup><a href="#loc.00817_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I think it may be a success pecuniarily too—Dearest Mother, I hope this will find
      you entirely well, &amp; dear sister Mat &amp; all.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00817_n1">1. Whitman adapted the
      material in this letter for inclusion in <em>November Boughs</em>
      (Richard Maurice Bucke, ed., <em>The Complete Writings of Walt
         Whitman</em> [New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 6:229-230). The sentence
      "this is a pretty time to talk of recognizing such villains" was attributed
      there to "a Pennsylvania officer in hospital." After this paragraph, Whitman
      added in the published version: "Then there is certainly a strange, deep, fervid
      feeling form'd or arous'd in the land, hard to describe or name; it is not a
      majority feeling, but it will make itself felt."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00817_n2">2. In the printed version in
      <em>November Boughs</em>, Whitman once more (see the notes to
      Whitman's letter from ) encouraged
      readers to infer that his services during the war were not confined to hospital
      visits: "M[other], you don't know what a nature a fellow gets, not only after
      being a soldier a while, but after living in the sights and influences of the
      camps, the wounded, &amp;c.—a nature he never experienced before." See <em>Complete Writings</em> (1902) 6:229.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00817_n3">3. Whitman was probably
      thinking of an incident which a soldier of Kilpatrick's cavalry had related to
      him, and which he recorded in "Hospital Book 12" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection) about this time. See the letter from 
       and <em>Complete Writings</em> (1902) 6:171.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00817_n4">4. The expulsion of
      Alexander Long; see the letter from . This paragraph up to "true as the north star" appeared in <em>November Boughs</em> (<em>Complete Writings</em>
      [1902], 6:230).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00817_n5">5. On  George informed his mother that
      Whitman in a recent letter wrote of "publishing a small book this Spring."
