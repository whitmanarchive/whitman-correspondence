   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00505_n7">1. This letter dates to October
      20, 1867. Both Richard Maurice Bucke and Edwin Haviland Miller dated the letter
      to October 20, 1867 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:378). Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman dated the letter "Octo 20" and referred to the day she wrote as Sunday,
      which is correct for the year 1867. The letter's concerns about Thomas Jefferson
      and Martha Mitchell Whitman are consistent with this period, and the letter
      resumes the subjects of Louisa's 
      letter to Walt, which was written "thursday last."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00505_n1">2. For her receipt of the
      "accustomed letter," in which Walt Whitman enclosed $10, see Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman.
      Edwin Haviland Miller dated Walt's lost letter October 20, 1867 (Walt Whitman,
      <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77], 1:370).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00505_n8">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      exaggerated the time since the last letter, but the most recent extant letter
      from Walt Whitman to Louisa is from . Walt Whitman's October 9, 1867 letter (mentioned later in this
      letter) is not extant. One reason for the lack of recent letters was that Walt
      visited Brooklyn from mid- to late-September 1867. Louisa reported her receipt
      of Walt's delayed letter on .<a href="#r3">[back]

      last."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00505_n11">5. Though the letter that
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman received on October 9, 1867 is not extant, Walt
      Whitman may have reported to her his recent completion of the essay "Democracy"
      for the <em>Galaxy</em>. In Louisa's  letter, she referred to the non-extant letter as
      "sent the 8th."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">6. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00505_n21">7. A man known only as Smith
      was George Washington Whitman's partner in building houses on speculation. Walt
      Whitman described Smith as "a natural builder and carpenter (practically and in
      effect) architect," and he advised John Burroughs that Smith was an "honest,
      conscientious, old-fashioned man, a man of family . . . . youngish middle age"
      (see Walt's  letter to
      Burroughs). The lot with the carpenter's shop, which belonged to Smith, was on
      Putnam Avenue (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt). Louisa asked Walt about purchasing the shop as a
      residence for herself (see her  letter to Walt).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">8. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">9. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00505_n5">10. Helen and Emily "Emma" Price
      were the daughters of Abby and Edmund Price and friends with Walt Whitman and
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Helen's reminiscences of Walt were included in
      Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em>
      (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for the first time some of
      Whitman's letters to her mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman to His Mother and an
      Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908],
      163–169).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00505_n9">11. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      postscript runs vertically in the right margin of the first page. The piece to
      which the postscript refers is Walt Whitman's "Democracy" (<em>Galaxy</em> 4 [December 1867], 919–33, reprinted in <em>Democratic Vistas</em> [Washington, 1871]). Walt Whitman announced the
      completion of "Democracy" to Francis P. Church and William C. Church in his  letter and forwarded a copy the
      following week. He presumably reported to Louisa that he had completed
      "Democracy" in the letter that she received on October 9, 1867 (see
      above).<a href="#r11">[back]
