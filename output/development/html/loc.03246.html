      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>May I, here is this old Africa &amp; very unhappy send a message to you in America
      who are helping me to bear my sorrow.

   <p>This [
      <span class="unclear">dry?</span>]
       month  I
      suffered the greatest loss that a young man can suffer by the death of the girl I
      loved, the girl who was to have been my wife. She loved your poems dearly: she
      taught me who loved them too to understand them as I had never understood them
      before. They were among the last things we ever read together but a few weeks ago
      in
      England when my life seemed so happy &amp; there seemed to be no shadow of the
      implacable 
      Death. I am reading your poems now again alone &amp; in the bitterness of my heart
      in this place to which I have come to struggle with my sorrow. They are helping me,
      they are strengthening me &amp; I wish to send you these few words of thanks &amp;
      gratitude for the sake of my dead love &amp; my living grief. Camerado, will you
      give me your hand across the sea.
