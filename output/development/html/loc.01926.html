      <br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>While considering the question of publishing Leaves of Grass we have consulted
      with several eminent literary men and they have advised us most strongly not to
      do it.
   </p>
   
   <p>In view of this fact, though, we are favorably impressed, as we were while we
      first wrote you, with the idea, we deem it injudicious to commit ourselves to
      its publication at the present time.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Abraham Simpson, while working for J. M.
      Bradstreet &amp; Son, had supervised the binding of <em>Drum-Taps</em> (see Walt Whitman's , letter to Peter Eckler). Simpson wrote on , that he was going into business for
      himself: "Hearing you are writing another book, [I] would like to print and
      publish it for you and will give you better advantages than any other publishing
      house. . . . One of my reasons for securing your friendship is my appreciation
      for you as a man, with knowing your life has been devoted to help among those
      most in need of your assistance." On ,
      Simpson informed Walt Whitman that "we have established a Ptg &amp; Publishing
      House." But, in his , letter, he
      advised Walt Whitman that after consultation "with several eminent literary men,
      . . . though we are favorably impressed, . . . we deem it injudicious to commit
      ourselves to its publication at the present time."
