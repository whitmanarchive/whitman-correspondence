      That is a grand letter of Arnolds,<sup><a href="#loc.07320_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> one of the best (most
      useful) letters we have had when you consider the writer and the enormous
      circulation it will have. I feel quite set up over it. No sign of Ed. Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r4">4</a></sup> here yet—he must have gone home (lives some miles from
      here in country) and no doubt he will be here today or tomorrow.<sup><a href="#loc.07715_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> I was out in
      country pretty much all yesterday seeing an old friend who is sick. Yes, I should
      be
      glad to see the "Critic" whenever you have one that you neither want to keep nor to
      send to someone else—It is a paper I always feel interested in looking over. A
      thousand thanks for your assurance as to the 1872 L. of G.<sup><a href="#loc.07320_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> and also for the prospect of "Harrington" which I sincerely hope you may some day
      find. All well here, no further word from Willy Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r7">7</a></sup> in re
      meter but I am satisfied that all is well in that quarter. We are all well.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07320_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey U.S.A. It is postmarked:
      London | AM | OC 25 | 89 | Canada; Camden, N.J. | Oct | 27 | 5 PM | 1889 | [illegible].<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07320_n3">3. Sir Edwin Arnold
      (1832–1904) was the author of the controversial <em>The
         Light of Asia . . . Being the Life and Teaching of Gautame . . . as told in
         verse by an Indian Buddhist</em> (London: Truber &amp; Co., 1879). Arnold
      had visited Whitman on September 13, 1889. Whitman reported the visit to
      Traubel: "[Arnold's] visit was only in transit—he goes back to New York at
      once—then across to San Francisco—then to Japan and the East
      Indies." Whitman found the visitor interesting but too effusive: "My main
      objection to him, if objection at all, would be, that he is too
      eulogistic—too flattering" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.158.html">Friday, September 13, 1889</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">4. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07715_n3">5. In his letter to Whitman of
      , Bucke reported that Wilkins
      visited him on October 29, 1889 and brought him a package of photographs from
      Whitman.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07320_n4">6. Bucke had coveted the
      1872 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> for some time. During his
      visit to Whitman (February to March 1889) Bucke had accidentally come across a
      copy. (See Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.44.html">Tuesday, March 5, 1889</a>.)<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4284">7. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
