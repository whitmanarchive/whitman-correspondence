      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing special to write about, yet I will send you a line. I wrote to Nelly
      between two &amp; three weeks ago<sup><a href="#nyp.00299_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—with a line to you and Charles Eldridge—which I suppose came all right at the time.
      I have been having a comfortable time, absolutely doing nothing, sleeping a good deal,
      eating &amp; drinking what suits me, and going out a few hours a day, a good part of the
      time on the water. Mother has had an attack of illness, somewhat severe, the last
      few days—&amp; I have been sort of nurse &amp; doctor—(as none of my sisters are home at present)—result
      is that Mother is very much better this morning—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>John Burroughs<sup><a href="#nyp.00299_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> has called on me—looking well.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I must tell you that the <em>Westminster</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00299_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> for July has for the 2d article of the number a long article of 33 or 4 pages, headed
      
      
      
      <br><br><span class="indent">"<em>The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</em>"</span><br><br>
      
      
      
      and capped with the names of the three last issued books—rather quiet in tone, but
      essentially very favorable &amp; appreciative—undertakes to define the character of democratic
      art &amp; poetic literature, as discriminated from aristocratic—quotes freely from all
      my books—will please you, I think.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Wednesday's brush in N. Y. you have seen in the papers<sup><a href="#nyp.00299_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—in five sixths of the city, it was curiously almost unfelt, every thing went on the
      same—30 or 40 killed and a hundred wounded—yet it all falls very languidly on our
      people—we have supped full of horror of late years—the <em>Policemen</em> looked &amp; behaved splendidly—I have been looking on them &amp; been with them much, &amp;
      am refreshed by their presence—it is something new—in some respects they afford the
      most encouraging sign I have got—brown, bearded, worn, resolute, American-looking
      men, dusty &amp; sweaty—looked like veterans—the <em>stock</em> here even in these cities is in the main magnificent—the heads either shysters, villains
      or impotents—Love to Nelly, Charles Eldridge &amp; Jeannie—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00299_n1">1. This letter is endorsed,
      "Answ'd July 16 | 71." Its envelope bears the address, "Wm. D. O'Connor, |
      Treasury Department, | Light House Bureau, | Washington, | D.C." It is
      postmarked, "New York | (?) | 14 | 1:30 PM."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00299_n2">2. For this letter, see
      Whitman's  letter to Ellen M.
      O'Connor.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00299_n3">3. Burroughs was one of Walt
      Whitman's staunchest defenders in print during this period; see his "More about
      Nature and the Poets," <em>Appleton's Journal</em>, 4 (September
      10, 1870), 314–316, and Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1931), 58.
      Burroughs issued the expanded second edition of his <em>Notes</em>
      in 1871.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00299_n4">4. An unsigned article by
      Edward Dowden (a professor of English literature at the University of Dublin;
      see also Whitman's  letter to
      Dowden) in the <em>Westminster Review</em>, 96 (1871),
      33–68. A few weeks later Whitman was still pleased with the review; he
      wrote positively about it in his 
      letter to William D. O'Connor and in his  letter to William Michael Rossetti.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00299_n5">5. With the headline "War at
      Our Doors," the New York <em>World</em> reported: "The ides of
      March have come and gone. In spite of the efforts of the clergy, the municipal
      authorities, and all good citizens, New York has been disgraced by a street
      fight in 1871 over the merits of an Irish battle fought and won in 1690." The
      journal devoted two full pages (in an eight-page issue) to the incident, and
      announced that 45 had been killed and 105 wounded. Whitman also wrote of the
      incident in his  letter to Peter
      Doyle.<a href="#r5">[back]
