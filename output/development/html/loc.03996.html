      <br></br><br></br>Dear Harry
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours 
      rec'd—I am just starting off a few miles out from 
      Phila—probably a
      day or two only<sup><a href="#loc.03996_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—will look up the book you require
      (if I can find one) soon as I come back—&amp; send you—I am 
      ab't
      
       as
      usual—nothing very new—
   </p>
   
   <p>—Hank if I'd known you was coming home last Sunday would have come down Saturday
      &amp; staid till Monday any way—You say you wrote a <u>blue
         letter</u> but didn't send it to me—dear boy the only way is to dash
      ahead and "whistle dull cares away"—after all 
      its
      
       mostly in one's self one
      gets blue &amp; not from outside—life is like the weather—you've got to
      take what comes, &amp; you
      
      
      can make it all go pretty well if only think so (&amp; provide in
      reason for rain &amp; snow)—
   </p>
   
   <p>—I wish it was so you could all your life come in &amp; see me often for an hour or
      two—You see I think I understand you better than any one—(&amp; like you
      more too)—(You may not fancy so, but it <u>is</u>
      so)—&amp; I believe Hank there are many things, confidences, questions,
      candid <u>says</u> you would like to have with me, you have never
      yet broached—me the same—
   </p>
   
   <p>—Have you read about Oscar Wilde?—He has been to see me &amp; spent an
      afternoon—He is a fine large handsome youngster—had the <u>good sense</u> to take a great fancy to <u>me</u>!<sup><a href="#loc.03996_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I was invited to receptions in 
      Phila.
      
       
      am'g
      
      
      the big bugs &amp; a grand dinner to him by Mr &amp; Mrs Childs—but did not go
      to any—Awful cold here, this is now the third day,—but you know all about <u>that</u>—(you say you know you are <u>a great fool</u>—don't you know every 'cute fellow secretly knows that
      about himself—I do)—God bless you my darling boy—Keep a brave
      heart—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03996_n1">1. There is no reference in
      Whitman's Commonplace Book to a visit to one of his friends (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). Jeff was with his brother on January 24 and 25, and
      apparently the poet was in Camden on January 26 and 28.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03996_n2">2. See the letter from
      Whitman to Oscar Wilde and Joseph M. Stoddart of . Burroughs, who also met Wilde in 1882, was less impressed
      (see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em>
      [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931], 235).<a href="#r2">[back]
