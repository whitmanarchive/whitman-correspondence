   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00208_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Mrs Anne Gilchrist | Keats' Corner—12 Well Road | Hampstead | London
      England. It is postmarked: Phila. Paid All | Jul | 22 | 1882 | Pa.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="upa.00208_n2">2. Anne Gilchrist wrote on
       and again on June 18. In the earlier
      letter she objected to Whitman's rearrangement of his poems and to the new
      titles in the 1882 edition. In the latter she praised "A Memorandum at a
      Venture": "It is as clear as daylight to me that you speak
      truth—invigorating ennobling truth, full of hope &amp; promise &amp;
      impetus for the race. I have never for a moment wavered in my belief in this
      truth since it burst upon me a veritable sunrise in reading your poems in 1869"
      (University of Pennsylvania). On July 28 Gilchrist in a letter to Burroughs
      offered her defense of Whitman, which she was willing to have submitted to the
      New York <em>Tribune</em> (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman
         and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin,
      1931], 220–221). The newspaper, however, declined to publish it (Barrus,
      242).<a href="#r2">[back]
