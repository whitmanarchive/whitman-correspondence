      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I don't feel that I should apologize for writing to you. I have wanted to do so for
      years. I have loved you for years with my whole heart and soul. No man ever lived
      whom I have so desired to take by the hand as you. I read Leaves of grass, and got
      new conceptions of the dignity and beauty of my own body and of the bodies of other
      people; and life became more valuable in consequence. After a year or
      two—always carrying you in my thoughts—holding imaginary conversations
      with you and dreaming of you day and night—I came across a lady who knew you, Mrs
      Lizzie Denton Seybold, now Baker. She had your portrait painted
      
          
      in oil. I made
      every effort to induce her to let me have the picture but she would not. Since that
      time—I was living in glorious California then—I have read with deepest
      interest every word about you in the papers and magazines, as well as every thing
      you
      have written. Sometimes I have been furious at what immodest people—idiots, have
      dared say of you and have longed to write my own pure and true convictions of you.
      But I cannot. I am too impetuous; I feel my subject too deeply. And yet I am a
      writer and make my living by my pen. Now that I have come east this far, where I am
      employed as editor on the Saturday Express,  I have the hope that I may sometime see
      your dearly beloved face, touch with my hand your beautiful grey hair, and possibly
      feel your arm about my waist. Because I love you so I have
       
      
      written these
      lines. It is nothing to me who sees them; I am proud of my feeling for you. It has
      educated me; it has done more to raise me from a poor working woman to a splendid
      position on one of the best papers ever published, than all the other influences of
      my life.
   </p>
   
   <p>I know you must have many letters from strangers, and so I will not take any more
      of
      your time in reading what I have to say. Of course I have no hope of receiving an
      answer to this. But I thought it no harm to let you know that my love went with you,
      and perhaps in some unknown way was a blessing to you all these years.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good bye dear Walt Whitman—<u>my beloved</u>, and may every
      influence in life contribute to your happiness.
   </p>
