   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07268_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: London | AM | No 12 | 88 | Canada; Camden N.J. | Nov | 13 | 1 PM |
      [illegible] | Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07268_n2">2. Bucke is referring to Julia Ady's
      "Jean-Francois Millet," <em>Nineteenth Century</em>, No. 139
      (September 1888), 419–438.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07268_n3">3. Bucke is referencing Alfred Sensier's <em>La Vie et l'oeuvre de J.F. Millet</em> [Live and Work of J.F. Millet] (Paris, 1881).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">4. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07268_n4">5. Bucke's quotation is a
      conflation of two sentences: He [Millet] thought of Gréville, and painted
      "Le Semeur," which, exhibited at the Salon in 1850, was hailed by at least one
      critic as a fine and original conception. . . . Here [i.e. in "Le Semeur"] the
      true Millet, <em>le Grand Rustique</em>, revealed himself for the
      first time (Ady, p. 428).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1044">6. Ralph Waldo Emerson
      (1803–1882) was an American poet and essayist who began the
      Transcendentalist movement with his 1836 essay <em>Nature</em>.
      For more on Emerson, see Jerome Loving, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_1.html">Emerson, Ralph Waldo [1809–1882]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07268_n5">7. Bucke omits Ady's
      qualifying national adjective: "the French peasant had never been held a fit
      subject for art" (p. 429).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07268_n10">8. Pierre Jules Théophile Gautier (1811–1872) was French
      poet, journalist, and literary critic. He published several collections of poetry,
      and a number of plays and novels.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07268_n6">9. Quite significantly,
      Bucke omits the last part of the quotation from Gautier: "'Here is a man,' said
      Gautier, 'who finds poetry in the fields, who loves the peasant, paints Georgics
      after Virgil'" (Ady, p. 432).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07268_n7">10. Bucke is quoting from 
      Whitman's "A Song of Occupations," 11. 2–3 (<em>Leaves of Grass: Comprehensive
         Reader's Edition</em>, Harold W. Blodgett and Sculley Bradley, eds.,
      1965).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07268_n8">11. The full quotation is:
      "'They wish to drive me into their drawing-room art," he said; "no, no, a
      peasant I was born and a peasant I will die; I will say what I feel and paint
      things as I see them'" (Ady, p. 433).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07268_n9">12. Bucke is attempting to draw a parallel
      between Millet's statement and Whitman's "To a Certain Civilian" (<em>Leaves of Grass: Comprehensive Reader's Edition</em>,
      Harold W. Blodgett and Sculley Bradley, eds., 1965, p. 323). In the poem,
      Whitman sets up a contrast between "[t]he drum-corps' rattle" (1. 6) and "the
      civilian's peaceful and languishing rhymes" (1. 2) As the poet of <em>Drum-Taps</em>, Whitman claims to "have been born of the same
      as the war was born" (1.5) and to "love well the marital dirge" (1. 6).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07230_n2">13. Bucke and his brother-in-law
      William John Gurd were designing a gas and fluid meter to be patented in Canada
      and sold in England.<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
