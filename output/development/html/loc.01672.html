   <p>I ought to have written to you before—but I believe lazy &amp; listless fits
      grow stronger &amp; frequenter on me as I get older—&amp; then I 
      dont
      
       do anything at all, especially just the things I ought to do—But I
      often, often think of you boy, &amp; let that make it up. I certainly am feeling
      better this winter,—more strength to hold out,—walking or like, than for
      nearly now four years—bad enough yet, but still <u>decidedly better</u>—(My loving boy I underscore the words, for I
      know they will make you feel good, to hear)
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I heard about the accident on the road at the time two weeks ago—&amp; was
      uneasy enough until I heard definite particulars—such things seem the
      fortune of RR travel, which I sometimes think more risky than the "fortune of war,"
      which the knowing ones know well is more chance &amp; accident (I mean the victory
      in battles) than it is generalship—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Pete I am sitting up here alone in my room, 8 o'clock p m, writing this—I
      am feeling quite comfortable—I stood the cold snap of the last three days very
      well—to-day has been moderate &amp; nice here—Nothing new or special in
      my affairs—I am selling a few of my books (the new 2 Vol. 10 dollar edition)
      from time to time—mostly to English &amp; Irish purchasers—it is quite
      funny how many of my books are sent for from
      Ireland<sup><a href="#loc.01672_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01672_n1">1. That this letter was
      written in 1876 is evidenced by Whitman's references to his paralysis in the
      first paragraph and to the 1876 edition in the last paragraph and by an entry in
      his Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01672_n2">2. A reference to Edward
      Dowden, who was primarily responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in
      Dublin.<a href="#r2">[back]
