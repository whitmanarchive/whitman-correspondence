   </p>
   
   <p> The lovely spirit fled on Sunday afternoon at five o'clock.....My darling
      mother's<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r2">2</a></sup> life has been ebbing for the last year: but she
      battled along accomplishing much good work in writing with devotion to us and her
      friends just the same...Four years ago mother was attacked by cancer in the breast,
      
      wch
      
       never caused her much pain or was the least distressing in any way but
      gradually sapped her strength. Dilatation of the heart was the immediate cause of
      death. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Ten days ago mother asked me if I  had written to you. I said that I
      had, just a week ago then. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Some day next year I am going to send you a photograph from my last picture of
      mother I painted it this summer. I have painted three elaborate and satisfactory
      portraits of mother &amp; oh how glad I shall be of them. I and brother (Percy
      Carlyle Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0263" id="r3">3</a></sup>) placed her semblance in my father's
      grave<sup><a href="#n0258" id="r4">4</a></sup> this morning at Kensal-Green and on her tomb I shall
      find a line from Leaves of Grass. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p> In a little memoranda addressed to us she noted your name down as the one friend
      in
      America to whom we were to write to, in announcing darling mother's death. 
   </p>
   
   <p> She died in my arms.<sup><a href="#loc.02179_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>

   <p id="n0259">2. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0263">3. Percy Carlyle Gilchrist (1851–1935) was the
      son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, the only of their four children who did not
      accompany their mother to Philadelphia in 1876 when she met Whitman, as Percy
      Gilchrist was newly married to Norah Fitzmaurice at the time. At about the same
      time (1875–1877), Percy Gilchrist collaborated with his cousin Sidney
      Gilchrist Thomas on refining the Bessemer process for the mass production of
