   <p>
      <em>My darling girl</em>, I enclose you a check for $50, hoping it will reach you before you leave Burlington<sup><a href="#mhs.00001_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I got home from Ark yesterday, after a pretty hard time—I had to abandon my Texas
      trip for the reason that I had some bids here to be opened on Monday &nbsp;I did not get
      here till Wednesday—but that was owing to the weather and the Rail Roads &nbsp;I shall
      go out to the cemetery on Sunday and leave Sunday night for Texas. I suppose I shall
      be gone about a week &nbsp;Mr Smith<sup><a href="#mhs.00001_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> of Leavenworth was at my office on Monday last and came for the express purpose of
      carrying me off to New York all expenses paid—but of course I could not go—much as
      I wanted to—No I must make the best of what is wanted now—I presume I shall have lots
      of time after awhile—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well my dear girl I wish you would go and do just what gives you the most fun—and I do hope you will make fast friends of the
      New York and Hartford people—they are good folk to know
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall write Horace<sup><a href="#mhs.00001_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> that you are at Worthens<sup><a href="#mhs.00001_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> after the 1st for ten days—I think he will call and ask you to go to his place—and
      if he does I would like to have you go
   </p>
   
   <p>Nothing new with me—I am feeling fairly well—except I have my old terrible cough—it
      is pulling me down some—but I shall get out all right when the spring comes
   </p>
   
   <p>Wish you would go and see Walt as often as you can</p>
   
   <p>
      <em>Love to all</em>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
