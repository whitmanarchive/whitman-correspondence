   <p>All quiet here. The affairs of the meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> look flourishing though there is a great
      deal to do yet before we get it fairly started. The weather with us keeps wonderful,
      pleasant. I had a long letter today from O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r3">3</a></sup>" he seems
      wonderfully bright and lively considering—His letter was all about you &amp;
      Donnelly.<sup><a href="#n4108" id="r4">4</a></sup> He sticks to you like a grand fellow as he is.
      The last news from Pardee<sup><a href="#n4274" id="r5">5</a></sup> is not good, still I do not know that
      he is really worse—I cannot make out much of a letter today  topics are scarce and I
      am probably somewhat stupid.—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been thinking over the "Riddle Song"<sup><a href="#loc.07228_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> and have made up my mind that the answer
      is "Good Cause" or "Old Cause" or some other words meaning about the same
      thing.—?—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n4108">4. Ignatius Loyola Donnelly
      (1831–1901) was a politician and writer, well known for his notions of
      Atlantis as an antediluvian civilization and for his belief that Shakespeare's
      plays had been written by Francis Bacon, an idea he argued in his book <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in Shakespeare's
         Plays</em>, published in 1888.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n4274">5. Timothy Blair Pardee
      (1830–1889) was a Canadian lawyer and politician, member of the
      Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontaria, Canada, and Minister of the
      Crown. Pardee appointed Richard Maurice Bucke, with whom he was a close friend,
      as the Superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane in Hamilton at its founding
      in 1876, and then the next year as Superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane
      in London. For more on Pardee, see H. V. Nelles, "Pardee, Timothy Blair," <em>Dictionary of Canadian Biography</em> Vol. 11 (Toronto:
