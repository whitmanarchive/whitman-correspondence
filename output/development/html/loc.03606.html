      <br></br><br></br>Dear Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Some while ago I received your kind present of the 2 vols.—Leaves of Grass &amp; Specimen Days: recieved them, I am certain you
      will believe, with extreme pleasure, &amp; with a grateful sense of your continuing
      to remember me across a somewhat long lapse of years. To be remembered by Walt
      Whitman  is what
      any man 
      shd
      
       be proud of, &amp; none is so more than I. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I have read the Specimen Days 
      vol.
      
       right thro: finding various new things, &amp; continual pleasure in
      reviewing my acquaintance with the old ones. Am extremely pleased to find in this
      copy of the book something 
      wh.
      
       is absent even from Mrs Gilchrist's<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r2">2</a></sup> copy—the photographs of your mother &amp; father. If you
      were blessed with an unsurpassably good mother, I can with truth say the same of
      myself. My mother is still with us—aged nearly 85: health &amp; faculties sound on the
      whole, but naturally bowed &amp; stricken with the weight of years. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I have also scanned with a good deal of attention (that of complete re-reading) my
      old &amp; constant admiration, the Leaves of Grass 
      vol.
      
       I observe that some edition (I think the Philadelphia edition is named,
      but my 
      vol.
      
       is not under my hand at the moment for reference) is mentioned as the only
      final &amp; complete form of Leaves of Grass. The 
      vol.
      
       with 
      wh.
      
       you favoured me is not the Philadelphia edition, but I am in hopes that it
      may none the less be regarded as complete. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I am glad to note in this country from time to time symptoms of the increasing
      appreciation of your works: especially something written by Ruskin,<sup><a href="#n3013" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; the Sonata from the Lincoln Dirge. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Accept as heretofore the affectionate respect &amp; regard of </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours always
      <br></br>W M Rossetti

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Walt Whitman | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is postmarked: LONDON, W.O. | 4 |

   <p id="n0259">2. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n3013">3. John Ruskin (1819–1900) was
      one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
      via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
      of ). Ruskin, according to Whitman,
      expressed "<em>worry</em> [...] that [<em>Leaves</em> is] <em>too personal</em>, too emotional,
      launched from the fires of [...] spinal passions, joys, yearnings" (see the
      letter from Whitman to William O'Connor of ). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my
      Ruskin with some qualifications." Still, Ruskin "is not to be made little of: is
      of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.4.html">Thursday, January 24, 1889</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
