      <br></br><br></br>Dear Andy,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter last Saturday—I intended to return day after to-morrow, but shall
      not be able to, till the last of the week, or the early part of next week. The reason
      is that my book, which is a little more than half done, does not get along as fast
      as the printers agreed—&amp; if I do not stay &amp; finish it, (the supervision of it,) it
      will be botched &amp; full of blunders.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am in good health &amp; all goes well. Andy, dear boy, I hope my delay of a few days
      will not put you out—Write to me, &amp; tell me about the office, &amp; my friends there.
      Don't forward any letters that come after Friday next, but put them in my drawer.
      Once more—I send my love to you &amp; all.
   </p>
