      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your welcome letter of December 30 came safe. I have written &amp; sent my application
      to Mr Otto,<sup><a href="#nyp.00196_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; also a few lines to Mr Ashton, with a copy of it.<sup><a href="#nyp.00196_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I am most desirous to get the appointment, as enclosing, with the rest of the points,
      my attentions to the soldiers &amp; to my poems, as you intimate.
   </p>
   
   <p>It may be Drum-Taps may come out this winter, yet, (in the way I have mentioned in
      times past.) It is in a state to put right through, a perfect copy being ready for
      the printers—I feel at last, &amp; for the first time without any demur, that I am satisfied
      with it—content to have it go to the world verbatim &amp; punctuation. It is in my opinion
      superior to Leaves of Grass—certainly more perfect as a work of art, being adjusted
      in all its proportions, &amp; its passion having the indispensable merit that though to
      the ordinary reader let loose with wildest abandon, the true artist can see it is
      yet under control. But I am perhaps mainly satisfied with Drum-Taps because it delivers
      my ambition of the task that has haunted me, namely, to express in a poem (&amp; in the
      way I like, which is not at all by directly stating it) the pending action of this
      <em>Time</em> &amp; <em>Land we swim in</em>, with all their large conflicting fluctuations of despair &amp; hope, the shiftings,
      masses, &amp; the whirl &amp; deafening din, (yet over all, as by invisible hand, a definite
      purport &amp; idea)—with the unprecedented anguish of wounded &amp; suffering, the beautiful
      young men, in wholesale death &amp; agony, everything sometimes as if in blood color,
      &amp; dripping blood. The book is therefore unprecedently sad, (as these days are, are
      they not?)—but it also has the blast of the trumpet, &amp; the drum pounds &amp; whirrs in
      it, &amp; then an undertone of sweetest comradeship &amp; human love, threading its steady
      thread inside the chaos, &amp; heard at every lull &amp; interstice thereof—truly also it
      has clear notes of faith &amp; triumph.
   </p>
   
   <p>Drum Taps has none of the perturbations of Leaves of Grass. I am satisfied with Leaves
      of Grass (by far the most of it) as expressing what was intended, namely, to express
      by sharp-cut self assertion, <em>One's-Self</em> &amp; also, or may be still more, to map out, to throw together for American use, a gigantic
      embryo or skeleton of Personality, fit for the West, for native models—but there are
      a few things I shall carefully eliminate in the next issue, &amp; a few more I shall considerably
      change.<sup><a href="#nyp.00196_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I see I have said I consider Drum-Taps superior to Leaves of Grass. I probably mean
      as a piece of wit, &amp; from the more simple &amp; winning nature of the subject, &amp; also
      because I have in it only succeeded to my satisfaction in removing all superfluity
      from it, verbal superfluity I mean. I delight to make a poem where I feel clear that
      not a word but is indispensable part thereof &amp; of my meaning.
   </p>
   
   <p>Still Leaves of Grass is dear to me, always dearest to me, as my first born, as daughter
      of my life's first hopes, doubts, &amp; the putting in form of those days' efforts &amp; aspirations—true,
      I see now, with some things in it I should not put in if I were to write now, but
      yet I shall certainly let them stand, even if but for proofs of phases passed away—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother &amp; all home are well as usual. Not a word for over three months from my brother
      George<sup><a href="#nyp.00196_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—the probabilities are most gloomy. I see the Howells<sup><a href="#nyp.00196_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> now &amp; then. I am well, but need to leave here—need a change. If you see Miss Howard
      tell her Jesse Mullery<sup><a href="#nyp.00196_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> has been to see me—came yesterday &amp; has just left this forenoon. He talked of nothing
      but her. His life is saved, &amp; he will have tolerably good strength &amp; health, at least
      for present. His address is Ward <sup><a href="#nyp.00196_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>, Centre st Hospital, Newark New Jersey. I was up at Mrs Price's the other night.
      She is better this winter. Mrs Paulina Wright Davis7 is stopping with her this winter.
      I have sent a paper with sketch of Hospital Visits, to Dr Wm F Channing.<sup><a href="#nyp.00196_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> I cannot forgive myself for not acknowledging his assistance for the Hospitals, by
      letter at the time. I send you another paper also, as you might like it. I take it
      by a line in your letter that Charles Eldridge has not gone to Boston.<sup><a href="#nyp.00196_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> I have been reading the strange articles from the Richmond press.<sup><a href="#nyp.00196_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup> A thousand Satans baffled, with terror, hatred, malignant squirming, appear in every
      paragraph. Little California is playing around me as I finish, &amp; has been for half
      an hour. Love to dear Nelly &amp; Jeannie &amp; all.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived with
      William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later John
      Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington years.
      William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor often complained about the
      various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his death. However, his
      government work was relieved by the presence of Whitman, whom he was to love and
      venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
      vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
      pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
      important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
      those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
      O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
      sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
      first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910], 513). For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see Deshae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00196_n100">1. The envelope for this
      letter bears the address: Wm D O'Connor | Light House Board | Treasury
      Department | Washington | D C. It is postmarked: New York | Jan | 6.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00196_n2">2. William T. Otto
      (1816–1905) was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Interior in January,
      1863, and took an active interest in Indian affairs. He resigned from this post
      in 1871, but held various other governmental posts for many years. See also note

   <p id="nyp.00196_n3">3. On December 30, O'Connor
      informed Whitman that Ashton had spoken to Otto "in your behalf. . . . We shall
      fetch it this time. I have every confidence that you will get a good and an easy
      berth, a regular income, &amp;c, leaving you time to attend to the soldiers, to
      your poems, &amp;c" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard &amp;
      Company, 1906–96], 2:401).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00196_n4">4. Of the 1867 edition Gay
      Wilson Allen observes: "What makes it important is Whitman's great exertion to
      rework the book by deletion, emendation, and rearrangement of the poems" (<em>Walt Whitman Handbook</em> [Chicago: Packard and Company,
      1946], 173). He omitted from the "Calamus" poems "Long I thought that knowledge
      alone would suffice me" (#8), "Hours continuing long, sore and heavy-hearted"
      (#9), and "Who is now reading this?" (#16).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00196_n5">5. George's last known
      letter was the one of . Though the
      family did not hear from George for some time, it did everything possible to
      send provisions to him and to arrange for a prisoner exchange. On , David F. Wright wrote to Whitman
      to explain that a gentleman who had a relative in an Ohio prison camp was
      anxious to arrange for an exchange: "Your brother's name was given &amp; the
      party promised to act upon it immediately."<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00196_n7">7. According to Whitman's
      "Hospital Book 12" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection), Sergeant Jesse Mullery,
      Company K, Fifteenth New Jersey, was in Ward A, Armory Square Hospital, on May
      14, 1864. The twenty-year-old boy had been "shot through shoulder, ball in
      lung—(ball still in probably near lung)—lost right finger." On June 23, 1864, he
      went home to Vernon, N. J., on furlough, and then served as assistant cook in
      the army hospital in Newark. On ,
      Mullery proposed a visit to Brooklyn. He was still at the Newark hospital on
      January 23, 1865. According to his letters of  and , he later was able
      to return to active duty. (In the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New
      York Public Library, there are four letters from Mullery and one from his father
      to Whitman.)In several letters Mullery referred to the kindnesses of a Miss
      Howard while he was in the hospital, and another soldier, Charles H. Harris, on
      , asked to be remembered to Miss
      Howard and her sister. On February 20, 1866, Mullery wrote that one of the
      Howard sisters had died the preceding fall, and recalled "the Same Sad Smile on
      her countenance" (The Library of Congress). Probably these were the Misses
      Sallie and Carrie Howard listed in the 1866 Directory, or the Miss Garaphelia
      Howard mentioned in "Letter from Walt Whitman to Ellen M. O'Connor, 3 February
      1874" (<em>Correspondence</em>, 2:271–272).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00196_n8">8. Pauline Wright Davis
      (1813–1876) was a well-known abolitionist and suffragette. She was the
      wife of Thomas Davis (1805–1895), a manufacturer of jewelry in Providence,
      Rhode Island, and a Congressman from 1853 to 1855. Whitman stayed at their home
      in October, 1868.<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00196_n11">11. The <em>New York Times</em> of this date quoted the following from the <em>Richmond Sentinel</em>: "Our authorities <em>must do more</em>. They must take care, whatever befalls us, to save us
      from the Yankees. <em>If adverse gales and devouring billows
         should constrain our storm-lost ship into some port, let it be no Yankee
         port. If an unpropitious Providence should condemn us to a master, let it
         not be a Yankee master</em>. Of all the people on earth, we should have most
      reason to loathe and to dread them. <em>Any terms with any other
         would be preferable to subjugation to them</em>."<a href="#r11">[back]
