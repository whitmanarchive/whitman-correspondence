      Dear Walt,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I write you briefly this morning before starting on my 2 week vacation to Delaware
      Co. I 
      rec<u>d</u> the pocket book copy<sup><a href="#med.00869_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> of L.G. 
      &amp; prize it very highly. It is unique. I was very sorry I could not see you on the
      day you
      was 70 years old. At that time I was having 
      one of my streaks of insomnia, &amp;
        
      was very wretched for two or three weeks. It has worn off &amp; I am feeling much better.
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      The summer has been a very busy one with me. The young grape vines grow so fast that
      it keeps me going to tie them 
      up to the stakes. I go about all day with two balls of 
      twine at my side, training the young vines in the way they should go, &amp; <u>tying</u> them in 
      that way. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I do hope you keep about. I wish some good masculine angel would come &amp; lift you out
      of Camden, bag &amp; baggage 
      &amp; set you down here, or
         
      or by the sea, or in the mountains A change of air now would greatly add to the length
      of your days. You ought to 
      know this, &amp; I will not bore you with it. I hear from Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r3">3</a></sup> now &amp; then, always gladly. 
      I have not seen O'Connor's<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r4">4</a></sup> reviews of Donnelly's<sup><a href="#n4108" id="r5">5</a></sup> Reviewers.<sup><a href="#loc.07305_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> If you have a copy send it to me at 
      Hobart N.Y. &amp; I will return it.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01170_n1">1. Whitman sent this letter from Burroughs to the Canadian physician and psychiatrist
      Richard Maurice Bucke,
      including it as an enclosure with his letter to Bucke of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00869_n3">2. Whitman had a limited pocket-book edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      printed in honor of his 70th birthday, on May 31, 1889, through special
      arrangement with Frederick Oldach. Only 300 copies were printed, and Whitman
      signed the title page of each one. The volume also included the annex <em>Sands at Seventy</em> and his essay <em>A
         Backward Glance O'er Traveled Roads</em>. See Whitman's , letter to Oldach. For more
      information on the book see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">4. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4108">5. Ignatius Loyola Donnelly
      (1831–1901) was a politician and writer, well known for his notions of
      Atlantis as an antediluvian civilization and for his belief that Shakespeare's
      plays had been written by Francis Bacon, an idea he argued in his book <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in Shakespeare's
         Plays</em>, published in 1888.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07305_n3">6. In his pamphlet <em>Mr. Donnelly's Reviewers</em> (Chicago: Belford, Clarke &amp;
      Co., 1889), O'Connor attempted to defend Ignatius Donnelly's Baconian theories,
      as found in <em>The Great Crytogram</em> (1887).<a href="#r6">[back]
