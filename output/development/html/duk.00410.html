   <p>Somehow I was always under the impression that the picture we have had so long was
      Jessie's which occassioned the demand for a photo of Manhatta.<sup><a href="#duk.00410_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> The picture of Jessie<sup><a href="#n1055" id="r2">2</a></sup> which you
      propose to send us, will compose the twain, and we shall not need one of Manhatta:
      I like that name! and my enthusiasm was rekindled in a very lively degree by the presence
      of these two
      blooming girls greeting me so warmly, calling me "Uncle Charlie" — I had just
      returned from a 
      second visit to the Adirondacks the day after they
      arrived. Han was sick — very sick. I doubt that she will ever be hale and strong,
      or normal again. 
      She thinks that, if she could make you a
      visit, and have a good long rest, she would be restored. You could suggest to her
      that, if at any time she would like to make you a visit, you would be prepared to
      recieve her: If, for the time, you could furnish a couple of rooms. It may be
      necessary. I had a talk with Dr Lund<sup><a href="#duk.00396_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> lately: he thought
      it would be beneficial to write to her. Continue the Phila Press: visit the
      Progress. dont need it. George<sup><a href="#n0700b" id="r4">4</a></sup> sent word that she should come,
      at any time, and remain with him as long as she desired.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a French-born
      landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman (1823–1890), Walt
      Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_96.html">Heyde, Charles Louis (1822–1892)</a>," <em>Walt
