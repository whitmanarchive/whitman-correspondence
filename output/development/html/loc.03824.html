      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy Logan
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter has come &amp; is welcomed—Nothing specially new with me—I
      have stood the hot weather pretty well &amp; have just eaten my dinner with
      zest—Young Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> is here yet—the portrait is
      ab't finished—good—he expects to take it to London for the May opening
      Royal Academy—I hear from your folks in London—How happy Mary<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> must be!—
   </p>
   
   <p>Quite a good many visitors come here—they talk &amp; I talk—as I write it
      is cloudy &amp; comparatively cool &amp; I am enjoying all. The carrier just brings
      me a letter from Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup>—he is well &amp;
      busy—comes this way early in September—Love to you, dear
      friend—

      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">3. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
