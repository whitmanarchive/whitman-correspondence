   <p>George is all right, unhurt, up to Tuesday morning, 10th inst—the 51st was in a bad
      battle last Friday, lost 20 killed, between 40 &amp; 50 wounded—I have just seen some of the 51st wounded, just arrived, one of them Fred Saunders, Corp[oral], Co
      K, George's company—he said when he left the 51st was in rear on guard duty—he left
      Tuesday mn'g last—the papers have it that Burnside's Corps was in a fight Tuesday,
      but I think it most probable the 51st was not in it—
   </p>
   
   <p>Fred McReady is wounded, badly, but not seriously—Sims is safe—you see LeGendre is
      wounded—he was shot through the bridge of nose<sup><a href="#loc.00826_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—

   <p>Mother, you ought to get this Friday forenoon, 13th—I will write again soon—wrote
      once before to-day<sup><a href="#loc.00826_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00826_n1">1. In his "Hospital Book 12"
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection), Walt Whitman recorded substantially the same
      information given here and in his letter from . Corporal Saunders (or Sanders) was confined in Finley Hospital.
      Whitman methodically cited the names and locations of the wounded soldiers from
      the Fifty-first Regiment who had been transferred to hospitals in or near
      Washington. For McReady, see Whitman's letter from ; for Sims, the letter from ; and for LeGendre, the letter from .<a href="#r1">[back]
