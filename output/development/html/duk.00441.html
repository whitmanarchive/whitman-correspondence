   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a French-born
      landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman (1823–1890), Walt
      Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_96.html">Heyde, Charles Louis (1822–1892)</a>," <em>Walt
