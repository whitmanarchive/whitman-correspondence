   <p>Han recd your card; was much concerned to learn that you had a fall: Weather is very
      warm here, but fine cool nights: mornings allmost frosty. The grandest genuine
      summer I ever knew. Mountains allways visible, asserting their supremacy. Vivid
      lightnings and startling thunder, with heavy showers. A big tornado passed, or
      crashed over the city, tearing a large luxuriant tree  that grew by the gate, by the
      roots, as if it had been a bramble, and twisting a large to pieces, that grew at the
      corner of the house, dividing the branches literaly, without knocking down the
      chimney nor even splintering a picket. How it razed and thrashed the slate roof; several
      houses were
      unroofed: the worst gale I ever saw: Han was much frightend: she is improving
      steadily, though weak: allright. She thinks if she could see you: talks of you great
      deal. I've not heard of the picture yet sent to George—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a French-born
      landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman (1823–1890), Walt
      Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_96.html">Heyde, Charles Louis (1822–1892)</a>," <em>Walt
