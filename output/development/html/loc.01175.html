      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Here I am back from 
      Pokeepsie
      
       in my little study to-night with a maple &amp; hickory fire burning in the
      open fire place &amp; thinking of you. This little shanty is a real solitude. Cut
      off from the house &amp; standing alone here on the brow of the hill. A wild rabbit
      lives under the floor &amp; the wild [
      <span class="unclear">wood?</span>]
       will scamper over head. But few of my friends
      have
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>visited me here, but here I sit by my open fire &amp; have long long thoughts of
      them. How I make them come trooping in. How many times have I planted you there in
      my big chair by the window, or here in front of the open fire &amp; talked the old
      talk with you. Alas, alas, that I should never see you here in the body as well as
      in the spirit. I talk at O'Connors<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup> picture &amp; think of him
      too so often, the brilliant one whom I shall see no more.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>How sacred is memory! as we grow old how much he lives in the past, how trivial &amp;
      cheap seems the present. A tender &amp; beautiful light fills my mind when I think
      of those years in Washington when we were all there; a light I know that never was
      on sea or land. How solemn &amp; pathetic, as well as beautiful it must seem to you,
      considering all you passed through there!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Chas. Eldridge<sup><a href="#n0210" id="r2">2</a></sup> sends me his wedding cards from California. I am
      glad he is married &amp; hope he is happy &amp; prosperous. I must write to him.
      Give him
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>my love if you write him. I think I told you we were housekeeping in 
      Pokeepsie
      
       for the winter. Mrs B<sup><a href="#n0892" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; Julian<sup><a href="#loc.01151_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> are there now, but I am back in my form &amp; at work
      for the past two days, &amp; I find it much better than hanging about the miserable
      little city. My winter has been flat stale &amp; unprofitable. I mean to delve the
      earth with vigor now to make up for it. I have seen nobody nor been anywhere. Should
      probably have gone to W. had not wife been sick for 5 weeks with the gripe. I get
      a
      glimpse of you now &amp; then in the paper. I hope you are comfortable. Do drop me a
      card if you can, or<sup><a href="#loc.01175_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> ask 
      Trauble
      
      <sup><a href="#n4267" id="r6">6</a></sup> to write me. Our winter has been a perpetual spring
      as I suppose yours has.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n2002">1. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n0210">2. Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

   <p id="n0892">3. Ursula North Burroughs
      (1836–1917) was John Burroughs's wife. Ursula and John were married on
      September 12, 1857. The couple maintained a small farm overlooking the Hudson
      River in West Park, Ulster County. They adopted a son, Julian, at two months of
      age. It was only later revealed that John himself was the biological father of
      Julian.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n4267">6. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
