      <br></br><br></br>Dear friends, all,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just rec'd the letter of the 10th—I sympathise deeply with those of you that
      have suffered with pains &amp; illness—but hope, from the wording of what you write, that
      it is now all over.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Poor Emily—it must have been such agony—that kind of distress<sup><a href="#pml.00019_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> 
      is about as severe as any thing can be, for human endurance—I hope Emily will try
      to go over, soon, and make a good call on Mother—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother isn't well—she has rheumatism pretty bad—I am sorry to hear that Helen has
      attacks of sick head-ache—&amp; that you too have been unwell—I do hope you are now both
      of you well, &amp; may continue so.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing important or new in my affairs here—I am still in the same Office—find
      my work mild &amp; agreeable, &amp; the place one remarkably well suited to a lazy, elderly,
      literary gentleman—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The O'Connors are well as usual—They have to move, the end of this month. 
      Mr. Parker<sup><a href="#pml.00019_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> wrote me, some time since, &amp; I have written an answer &amp; sent it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I still go to the Hospitals—always go Sunday afternoons.</p>
   
   
   <p>We are having a dark, cloudy, rainy time here, just now—not for a novelty—I have good
      health, &amp; good spirits. I send love to you &amp; Helen &amp; Emmy &amp; all, not forgetting Mr.
      Arnold—Remember me to Arthur, when you write—God give you health, in body &amp; in spirit—Farewell,
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pml.00019_n1">1. This letter's envelope
      bears the address, "Abby H. Price, | 279 East 55th street, | New York City." It
      is postmarked, "Washington | Mar | 13 | D.C."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00019_n3">2. Someone, probably Helen
      Price, had written above this word, "(Ear ache)."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00019_n4">3. In 1860, Erastus Otis Parker
      was indicted on seven counts of theft. On , Whitman wrote a letter to Attorney General Henry Stanbery
      successfully petitioning for a pardon on the grounds that "the whole theory on
      which he was convicted was but an inference from an inference" and that Parker
      had "already served four years in prison."<a href="#r3">[back]
