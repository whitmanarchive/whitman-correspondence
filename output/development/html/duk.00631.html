   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00631_n1">1. This letter dates to May 6
      or May 7, 1873. Edwin Haviland Miller dated the letter about May 9?, 1873 (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:217, n. 75), but it is more likely to date
      two or three days earlier. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman instructed Walt Whitman to
      send no more papers. Walt had enclosed two newspapers with his  letter, but he never again forwarded
      newspapers to his mother. The letter is unlikely to date to May 8, 1873 or
      later: "I shall feel anxious until I hear from you," Walt wrote in his  letter to his mother. Had Walt
      received a letter a day or two before writing his, he would have been unlikely
      to express such concern. So this letter from Louisa probably dates before May 8,
      1873.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00631_n3">2. The letter that Louisa
      received on Sunday or Monday, which Walt wrote on May 4 or May 5, 1873, is not
      extant.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00631_n4">3. Walt had enclosed
      newspapers, including the <em>Sunderland Times</em>, an English
      newspaper, with his  letter. Also see
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's 
      letter to Walt, in which the shortness of the letter and deficient handwriting
      suggest another and more serious episode followed. Louisa described the later
      episode, probably a stroke, the following week: "my head and my very brain has
      seemed to be affected" (see her 
      letter to Walt).<a href="#r3">[back]
