   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Kennedy, Burroughs, and Bucke were
      three of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Kennedy (1850–1929) first
      met Whitman while on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> in 1880, and would go on to write a book-length study of the
      poet. Burroughs (1837–1921), a naturalist, met Whitman in Washington, D.C.
      in 1864 and became one of Whitman's most frequent correspondents. He would also
      go on to write several studies of Whitman. Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian
      physician, was Whitman's first biographer, and would later become one of his
      medical advisors and literary executors.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00835_n3">1. This letter is endorsed:
      [Joint letter to myself, John Burroughs &amp; Dr Bucke | sent first to me with
      request to forward].<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00835_n1">3. According to Kennedy's
      notation on his transcription of this letter, it was written on the verso of one
      from Eldridge "describing the state of health of Wm D. O'Connor. Nervous
      prostration with a good deal of rheumatism."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00835_n2">4. According to Whitman's
      Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) he was able to take "a
      ride out" on March 21.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0830">5. Joseph B. Marvin, a friend and
      an admirer of Whitman's poetry, was from 1866 to 1867 the co-editor of the <em>Radical</em>. He was then appointed as a clerk in the Treasury
      Department in Washington, on behalf of which he took a trip to London in the
      late fall of 1875. On , Whitman
      wrote a letter to William Michael Rossetti to announce a visit from Marvin.
      Rossetti gave a dinner for Marvin, which was attended by the following "good
      Whitmanites": Anne Gilchrist; Joseph Knight, editor of the London <em>Sunday Times</em>; Justin McCarthy, a novelist and writer for
      the London <em>Daily News</em>; Edmund Gosse; and Rossetti's
      father-in-law, Ford Madox
      Brown.<a href="#r5">[back]
