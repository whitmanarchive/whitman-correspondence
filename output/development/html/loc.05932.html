   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05932_n1">1. Draft letter. It can be
      assumed that Whitman sent the receipt to Rice at the  he wrote to Redpath. The transaction was recorded in
      Whitman's Commonplace Book on August 15 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4981">2. James Redpath (1833–1891),
      an antislavery activist, journalist, and longtime friend of Whitman, was the
      author of <em>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown</em> (Boston:
      Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the <em>New York
         Tribune</em> during the war, and the originator of the "Lyceum" lectures. He
      met Whitman in Boston in 1860 and remained an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 9
      vols., 3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp." Redpath became
      editor of <em>The North American Review</em> in November 1886. See
      also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins, 1926);
