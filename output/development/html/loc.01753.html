      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete, Dear son,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter the first of the week, &amp; was interested in your acc't of
      your week of laying off, &amp; of the playing of the band under Schneider and
      Petrola<sup><a href="#loc.01753_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—also about City RR. men—I send my love
      &amp; best respects to all of them—
   </p>  
   
   
   <p>—I have had a bad spell again this week—for three days I have had a
      succession of those <u>blurs</u> again—only very much
      worse than ever before—last night I slept pretty well, &amp; havn't had
      any of them yet to-day, but my head feels sore &amp; ready to have them, almost
      if I move across the room—I am sitting here, feeling pretty bad,  my head unsettled
      and dizzy—I don't go out any more—but am up &amp;
      dressed—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Still Pete I do not get discouraged but think it will pass over, &amp; I
      shall feel better, &amp; strong enough to come back to Washington—Still I
      don't know—I think it best to face my situation—it is pretty
      serious. I send you a card—&amp; if I should get bad, I will certainly
      send you word, or telegraph—I will write Monday or Tuesday next—We
      have moved into my brother's new house—I am up in the 3d story room, fronting south—the sun is
      shining in bright—it is beautiful October weather here—My brother
      had a large room, very handsome, on 2d floor, with
      large bay window fronting west built for me, but I moved up here instead, it is
      much more retired, &amp; has the sun—I am very comfortable here indeed,
      but my <u>heart</u> is blank &amp; lonesome utterly
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p><u>11 o'clock a.m.—sitting by the window—1st floor</u>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just been talking with a young married RR man Thomas Osler, I fell in
      with—he has a bad bone-gathering on his left hand, a sort of felon,
      suffered greatly with it 5 days &amp; nights—had it lanced yesterday,
      &amp; is better—he stood by the open window, 1st floor, &amp; talked with me, while I sat in an
      arm-chair inside—he is a regular RR. man—you could tell by the cut
      of his jib, low collar, cap, clean shirt (for holiday) dark complexion, &amp;
      hard dark hands. I took quite a fancy to him &amp; <u>of
         course</u>, I suppose he did to me—I believe he works on the
      locomotive
   </p>
   
   <p>—Pete you must tell me how you put in the past week—I like such a letter as your last
      one—written two or three
      different times—It gave me a good idea of what you are doing—&amp;
      also of how things look in Washington.—I have written a line to Col.
      Hinton &amp; shall write a line to Eldridge—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p><u>3 o'clock p.m.</u>—My head is feeling very sore &amp;
      touchy &amp; sensitive—I dont go out—I have re-written my will<sup><a href="#loc.01753_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—What little I have to leave I have left mainly to my lame brother
      Ed, poor man—Pete I have left you $200 &amp; my gold
      watch—(but it will be much better for us to spend the money together,
      &amp; I have no doubt we shall do so) This house is quite pleasant—it is
      on the corner—fronts south—side to west—plenty of light and
      air—and view—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This afternoon I am quite in hopes I am getting better of my spells to-day—as I have
      not yet had any actual <u>spells</u>, though I have
      felt pretty sick all day. But I have been up all day, &amp; eat quite a
      breakfast, and quite a bite for dinner—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete I have written plainly, because I want you to be prepared, if any thing
      should happen to me—but I tell you <u>honest</u>, I still
      think I shall pull through—&amp; that I shall be able to write better
      news early next week—don't you be alarmed yet
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01753_n1">1. Whitman was fond of
      Salvador Petrola, a cornetist in the Marine Band; see Hans Nathan, "Walt Whitman
      and the Marine Band," <em>The Bulletin of the Boston Public
         Library</em> 18 (1943), 51, 53. Petrola became the assistant to Louis
      Schneider, who was appointed conductor in September, 1873. See also <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>, 10 vols. (New
      York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902), 8:9.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.01753_n2">2. For a previous will, see
      the letter from Walt Whitman to George Washington and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      of . According to Clara Barrus,
      Whitman also made a will on May 16, in which he bequeathed a silver watch to
      Doyle (<em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston:
      Houghton Mifflin, 1931], 82).<a href="#r2">[back]
