   <p>It is now some time since I have written to you, or heard any thing from you.<sup><a href="#rlc.00014_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> I still remain here laid up unwell from my paralysis—but
      keep much the same—no worse. I enclose you some slips—those relating to myself,
      (which tell their own story) because I know you will be interested in any thing about
      me<sup><a href="#rlc.00014_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—and the humorous pieces because I remember you are curious
      about American dialect &amp; fun literature.<sup><a href="#rlc.00014_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I write, it is a dark, rainy, muddy day. I am to recite a piece tonight for the
      benefit
      of the poor fund<sup><a href="#rlc.00014_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup>—it will be printed in the paper, &amp; I
      will send it to you. I tell you this partly to show you I still take some part in
      affairs,
      though I am badly shattered &amp; old. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Remember your letters are always welcome to me. </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0793">1. Rudolf Schmidt, a Dane and
      editor of <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em>, is credited with
      introducing Walt Whitman to Scandinavia by quoting translated passages from <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in a 1872 essay in his magazine. He wrote
      to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871:
      "I intend to write
      an article about yourself and your writings in the above named periodical which
      is very much read in all the Scandinavian countries. ... I therefore take the
      liberty to ask you, if you should not be willing to afford some new
      communications of yourself and your poetry to this purpose" (The Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]

      Springfield <em>Republican</em> and the <em>West

      Schiller's "The Diver" (Clifton Joseph Furness, <em>Walt Whitman's
         Workshop</em> 1928, 205). The program for the "Musical—Literary
      Entertainment, under the auspices of the Walt Whitman Debating Club of Camden,
      N.J.," is in the Oscar Lion Collection, New York Public Library.<a href="#r5">[back]
