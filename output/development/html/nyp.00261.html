      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd Jeff's letter on Monday—I am sorry to hear you suffer so much with the
      rheumatism, &amp; it is so bad in the wrist—Jeff thinks it is because you wash
      &amp; do the rough work, &amp; expose yourself too much—Mother, I would like
      if you would get some woman to come every week, or every other week, for a day,
      &amp; do the washing, &amp;c.<sup><a href="#nyp.00261_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>—As to the little girls, Jeff says they <em>will</em> be
      with you, &amp; bother you sometimes too much—When one is old, one is easily
      tired and annoyed—&amp; I have long been sorry you can't have more quiet to
      yourself &amp; rest.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Every thing goes the same as usual with me—The young man that had bleeding at
      the lungs<sup><a href="#nyp.00261_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> seemed to be getting along pretty well, till Saturday &amp; Sunday last,
      when he had a return of the sweating spells—they weaken him very much—I
      was down there Sunday—He has been very dissipated though only 24 years
      old—I believe I told you he is an only son.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We had a warm &amp; clear day here yesterday—after the usual long spell of
      rainy &amp; dark weather—Washington is nothing but mud—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I took tea at O'Connors last Sunday night—they are all well as usual—have got to move,
      the end of this month—they have found no place
      yet—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Ashton, the Assistant Attorney Gen'l<sup><a href="#nyp.00261_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>, has gone on to Philadelphia with wife &amp; child,
      to spend three or four days—I like my new boarding place very well, take it
      altogether<sup><a href="#nyp.00261_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I am writing this at my table, by the big window I have mentioned several
      times in former letters—it is very pleasant indeed—the river looks so
      fine, &amp; the banks &amp; hills in the distance—I can sit sometimes &amp;
      look out for a long time—It is mighty lucky for me I fell in with such a good
      situation—Mother, if it was only so where I could come home oftener, &amp; see
      you &amp; all—I have not thought any thing decided of the visit I spoke
      of—I will send you word in good time, if I should come—I should rather
      stop home, this
      time,
      if I come, as I should only be for a few days, not more than a week—I can
      sleep in the room George did—or any how. O, I must tell you I am getting a new
      coat—sack-coat, dark blue—I have pants of the same—&amp; shall
      have to get a new vest—when I shall come out quite spruce—I had 6
      shirts made last July, &amp; they are good yet—So much for the clothing
      department. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jeff don't say whether you got my last Tuesday's letter, (March 5,) with the
      envelopes, &amp;c.<sup><a href="#nyp.00261_n8" id="r6">6</a></sup>—but I suppose of course you did—Yesterday was such a fine day, I went off
      about 1 o'clock &amp; had quite a jaunt—went to Georgetown, &amp;c. &amp;
      walked so, I got very tired, when I arrived home—We don't have dinner till 5
      o'clock—but I always take a good lunch in my pocket—the table is
      furnished with plenty, &amp; good—Mother, I think about you a great
      deal—I think, what if mother is sick &amp; bothered, &amp; every
      thing—&amp; I feel as if I should fly—I go evenings up to the office
      frequently—I have got me a splendid astral-lamp, to burn gas by a tube, &amp;
      it works to admiration, (all at the expense of the office)—&amp; there I can
      sit, &amp; read &amp;c. as nice as you please—then I am getting many books
      for the Library (our office Library) that I have long wanted to read at my
      leisure—&amp; can get any book I want, in reason—so you see it is a
      great privilege I have here. Love to dear sister Mat, &amp; little ones, &amp; all.
