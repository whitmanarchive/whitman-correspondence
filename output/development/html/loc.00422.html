      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The enclosed $25 is from my old friend Joseph P. Davis<sup><a href="#loc.00422_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> who is Engineering down in Peru. Although he is far away yet he does not forget home.
      I have written him in some of my letters what you were doing, with short extracts
      from your letters.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well Walt it looks as if we had met rather a bad reverse in the West. If Rosecrans<sup><a href="#loc.00422_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> is whipped I should hardly think that the United States was large enough to contain
      the infernal quacks that administer the military arm of our government. I suppose
      their is at least 30 000 men <em>nibbling</em> around in Kansas and other parts west. Matters that would tumble of their own weight
      if the army in front of Rosecrans was thouroughly whipped. Tis awful to think of. I mailed you a letter from George a few days since,
      did you get it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother is abt the same as usual. I think she fails somewhat. I suppose not more than we must expect
      however. Mattie and the babies are quite well. Hattie is getting to be quite a girl,
      and the little one is also getting to be quite a youngster. Jess is abt the same, he is not well. He needs good living more than anything I think. Andrew
      I suppose Mother wrote you about &nbsp;I think that it is unfortunate that he should be
      so humbuged by the "Italian Dr."<sup><a href="#loc.00422_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> but I suppose he would not otherwise have tried to get well at all &nbsp;The Dr. requirs him to pay $180 in 3 installments in <em>advance</em>. He has paid $46 and is now living his 15 days at the "Foriegn Dr's" as a prepairing course, then he is to take certain baths. The whole thing in my opinion is one of
      the biggest of humbugs. However if Andrew believs in it I suppose it is best to bolster him up in his beliefs.
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall write you again [in] a few days sending you some more money. till then good
      bye

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00422_n1">1. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. A lifelong friend of Jeff Whitman's, he became city engineer of
      Boston (1871–80) and completed his distinguished career as chief engineer
      of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (1880–1908). For his work
      with Jeff in St. Louis, see Thomas Jefferson Whitman's letters to Walt Whitman
      from , , and .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00422_n2">2. Major General William
      Stacke Rosecrans (1819–1898) performed admirably in the Chattanooga
      campaign, but his tactical blunders at Chickamauga (September 1863) were
      disastrous. He was soon relieved of command on the advice of General Grant and
      Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00422_n3">3. Although Jeff
      repeatedly complained about this doctor (see Jeff's letter to Walt from ) George and Walt Whitman were
      willing to let Andrew experiment with him. On , George wrote Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, "I had a letter from
      Walt, dated Sept. 28th &nbsp;he said that Andrew was considerable better and was
      Doctoring with a celabrated Italian Doctor in Court St. I dont have much faith
      in them new fangled foreign Doctors, but if Andrew is realy so much better, it
      is good encouragment to keep on and give him a fair trial" (Jerome M. Loving,
      ed., <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em>
      [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975], 107). Near the end of
      October Andrew changed to Dr. John H. Brodie who lived on Myrtle Avenue (Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman, October 30 [?], 1863 [Trent Collection of
      Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections
      Library]).<a href="#r3">[back]
