   <p>I knew Reuben Farwell as a first-class soldier (it was in
      1863 or '64)<sup><a href="#hsw.00763_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> of a Michigan Regiment—he was in Ward
      A, Armory Square Hospital, Dr Bliss Superintendent<sup><a href="#loc.00876_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I was with him off &amp; on some months &amp; remember the case perfectly
      well. He had a very bad foot wound, &amp; I should judge it something that would
      deteriorate his health &amp; more or less incapacitate him through life
      afterward—till his death—&amp; even toward that event—which as I
      understand occurred about a year ago. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I strongly recommend the granting a pension to his widow Ann E. Farwell.</p>

   <p id="loc.00876_n3">4. D. Willard Bliss
      (1825–1889) was a surgeon with the Third Michigan Infantry, and afterward
      was in charge of Armory Square Hospital. See John Homer Bliss, <em>Genealogy of the Bliss Family in America, from about the year 1550 to
         1880</em> (Boston: John Homer Bliss, 1881), 545. He practiced medicine in
      Washington after the war; see the letter from Whitman to Hiram Sholes of . When a pension for Whitman was
      proposed in the House of Representatives in 1887, Dr. Bliss was quoted: "I am of
      opinion that no one person who assisted in the hospitals during the war
      accomplished so much good to the soldiers and for the Government as Mr. Whitman"
      (Thomas Donaldson, <em>Walt Whitman the Man</em> [New York: F. P.
      Harper, 1896], 169).<a href="#r4">[back]
