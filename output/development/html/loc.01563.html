      <br></br><br></br>Dear Benton Wilson,
      <br></br>Dear loving comrade,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I have just been again reading your last letter to me of December 19, last, I think
      I
      wrote to you on receiving it, but cannot now remember for certain. Sometimes, after
      an
      interval, the thought of one I much love comes upon me strong &amp; full all of a
      sudden—&amp; now as I sit here by a big open window, this beautiful afternoon, every
      thing quiet &amp; sunny—I have been, &amp; am now, thinking so of you, dear young
      man,<sup><a href="#loc.01563_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; of your love, or more rightly speaking, our love
      for each other—so curious, so sweet, I say so <em>religious</em>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We met there in the Hospital<sup><a href="#loc.01563_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>—how little we have been
      together—seems to me we ought to be some together every day of our lives—I don't
      care about talking, or amusement—but just to be together, &amp; work together, or go
      off in the open air together—Now it is a long while since we have been
      together—&amp; it seems a long while since I have had a letter. Don't blame me for not
      writing oftener. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I know you would feel satisfied if you could only realize how &amp; how much I am thinking
      of you, &amp; with what great love,<sup><a href="#loc.01563_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> this afternoon. I can hardly
      express it in a letter<sup><a href="#loc.01563_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup>—but I thought I would just write a
      letter this time off-hand to you, dearest soldier, only for love to you—I thought
      it
      might please you. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing very new or different in my affairs. I am still working here in Atty Gens
      office—same 
      posish
      
      —have good health—expect to bring out new editions of my books before
      very long—how is the little boy—I send my love to him, &amp; to your wife &amp;
      parents.<sup><a href="#loc.01563_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The friendship of Walt Whitman
      with this former soldier can be reconstructed from Benton H. Wilson's
      letters in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection. On , Wilson recalled his confinement in Armory Square
      Hospital (as mentioned in Whitman's , letter to Lewis K. Brown), "when your kind face
      &amp; pleasant words cheered the soldier Boys &amp; won their hearts. I
      never shall forget the first time you came in after David &amp; I got there.
      We Loved you from the first time we spoke to you." In Wilson's first letter,
      written on , he began: "I
      suppose you will think that I have forgotten you long before this time but I
      have not, your kindness to me while in the hospital will never be forgotten
      by me." After a lapse in the correspondence, he wrote on : "I wish if aggreable to
      yourself to keep up a regular correspondence between us ... I think it will
      be of benefit to me morally, and perhaps will not be of any detriment to
      you." In this letter he admitted that he had just discovered that Walt
      Whitman was a poet. On , he
      informed Walt Whitman that he had been reading <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>, but complained: "I wrote to you a year and more ago that I
      was married but did not receive any reply, so I did not know but you was
      displeased with it"; he concluded the letter: "I remain as ever yourBoy
      Friendwith LoveBenton H. Wilson." Walt Whitman replied (lost), and
      sent <em>The Good Gray Poet</em>, which Wilson acknowledged on
      . On , after he informed Walt Whitman
      that his wife had gone to the hospital for her first confinement (the child
      was to be named Walt Whitman), Wilson complained: "I am poor and am proud of
      it but I hope to rise by honesty and industry. I am a married man but I am
      not happy for my disposition is not right. I have got a good Woman and I
      love her dearly but I seem to lack patience or something. I think I had
      ought to live alone, but I had not ought to feel so." On , Wilson acknowledged Walt
      Whitman's reply of : "I do not
      want you to misunderstand my motives in writing to you of my Situation &amp;
      feelings as I did in my last letter or else I shall have to be more guarded
      in my letters to you. I wrote so because you wanted me to write how I was
      situated, and give you my mind without reserve, and all that I want is your
      advice and Love, and I do not consider it cold lecture or dry advice. I wish
      you to write to me just as you feel &amp; express yourself and advise as
      freely as you wish and will be satisfied." On , Wilson wondered why Walt Whitman had not
      replied.<br><br>
      In his letter of , Wilson
      reported that he had moved to Greene, N. Y., but was still selling melodeons
      and sewing machines (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). On , Wilson informed Walt Whitman of
      his father's death two weeks earlier and related that his son "Little Walt
      ... is quite a boy now ... and gets into all kinds of Mischief." Benton's
      father, who "was insane at times," had written to Walt Whitman on , and on  (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection). Evidently Wilson wrote to Walt Whitman for the last time on
      June 23, 1875, when he wanted to know "what I can do to contribute to your
      comfort and happiness" (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York
      Public Library).

   <p id="loc.01563_n3">2. Originally Walt Whitman wrote "dearest
      young man."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01563_n4">3. Walt Whitman struck out the following:
      "How good it was that we met—I remember the times we used to sit there in
      the Ward in Armory Square Hospital."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01563_n5">4. The first reading was: "with what peculiar
      great love."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01563_n6">5. At this point, obviously groping for
      words, Walt Whitman wrote but then deleted: "O if we could only be together now
      even if only Dear Boy, dear, dear friend, my dear solider—dear
      comrade."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01563_n7">6. In 1888 Walt Whitman commented to Horace
      Traubel about this letter: "I can't live some of my old letters over again. . .
      . Comradeship—yes, that's the thing: getting one and one together to make
      two—getting the twos together everywhere to make all: that's the only bond
      we should accept and that's the only freedom we should desire: comradeship,
      comradeship" (Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.71.html">2:370–371</a>).<a href="#r6">[back]
