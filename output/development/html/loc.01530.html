      <br></br><br></br>Dear son,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I see by your letter of the 4th that you are working as usual. I sometimes fancy I
      see
      you—and 14—and Mr. Shedd<sup><a href="#loc.01530_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—going up or down the
      Avenue—or at the end at Georgetown—or Navy Yard—the old familiar route
      &amp; scenes—the Circle, the President's House—Willard's—7th
      street—Capitol Gate—the Hill—&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I keep pretty busy, writing, proof–reading, &amp;c. I am at the printing office several
      hours every day—I feel in capital health &amp; spirits—weigh several pounds
      heavier—but, as a small drawback, &amp; something new for me, find myself needing
      glasses every time I read or write—this has grown upon me very rapidly since &amp;
      during the hot weather, &amp; especially since I left Washington—so I read &amp; write
      as little as possible, beyond my printing matters, &amp;c—as that occupies several
      hours, &amp; tires my eyes sometimes. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are having splendid fall weather, both days &amp; nights. Last night I was out
      late—the scene on the river was heavenly—the sky clear, &amp; the moon shining
      her brightest—I felt almost chilly at last with the cold—&amp; so put for home.
      One of the prettiest sights now is to see the great German steamers, and other ships,
      as
      they lay tied up along shore, all covered with gay flags &amp; streamers—"dress ship"
      as they call it—flaunting out in the breeze, under a brilliant sky &amp; sun—all
      in honor, of course, of the victory of the German armies<sup><a href="#loc.01530_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—all the spars &amp; rigging are hid with hundreds &amp; hundreds of flags—a
      big red–white–&amp; black flag capping all—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Of course you may know that the way the war<sup><a href="#n0245" id="r4">4</a></sup> turns out suits me to death—Louis
      Napoleon fully deserves his fate—I consider him by far the meanest scoundrel (with
      all
      his smartness) that ever sat on a throne. I make a distinction however—I admire &amp;
      love the French, &amp; France as a nation—of all foreign nations, she has my sympathy
      first of all.<sup><a href="#loc.01530_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, I was just reading over your last letter again. Dear son, you must try to keep
      up a
      good heart. You say you do—but I am afraid you are feeling, (or have felt,) somewhat
      unhappy. One soon falls into the habit of getting low spirited or 
      deprest
      
       &amp; moody—if a man allows himself, he will always find plenty to make him
      so—Every one [has] his troubles, disappointments, rebuffs, &amp;c. especially every
      young &amp; proud-spirited man who has to work for his living. But I want you to try &amp;
      put a brave face against every thing that happens—for it is not so much the little
      misfortunes of life themselves, as the way we take them &amp; brood over them, that causes
      the trouble. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>About the "<em>tiresome</em>,"<sup><a href="#loc.01530_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup> all I have to say
      is—to say nothing—only a good smacking kiss, &amp; many of them—&amp;
      taking in return many, many, many, from my dear son—good loving ones too—which
      will do more credit to his lips than growling &amp; complaining at his father. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

      Prussia preceding a vacancy on the Spanish throne, the Franco-Prussian War (July
      1870–May 1871) ended in complete Prussian victory and facilitated the
      unification of Germany, whose previously unaffiliated states had allied with
      Prussia. In the New York <em>Evening Mail</em> on October 27,
      1870, the Washington correspondent reported: "At the commencement of the present
      war in Europe [Walt Whitman] was strongly German, but is now the ardent friend
      of the French, and enthusiastically supports them and their Republic" (Charles
      I. Glicksberg, <em>Walt Whitman and the Civil War</em> [1933],
