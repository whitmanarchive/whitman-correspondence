   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you today a London paper with a sample of the controversy that has been going
      on here for some time about "Leaves of Grass,"<sup><a href="#man.00005_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> I think it is quite likely that a few copies could now be sold in this neighbourhood.
      I have seen [
      <span class="unclear">a?</span>]
       bookseller about it and I am going to propose a plan to you. It is this: I.I. Anderson
      &amp; Co. [
      <span class="unclear">will?</span>]
       keep "Leaves of Grass" and advertise it with their ordinary book-list and they will
      have 10 p.c. i.e. 50¢ a vol. for selling it—I will hand over to them the vols. that are on the way now and they will get others from you as they need them—You will
      always notify me when you send them books &amp; the number of vols. sent—I will be responsible to you for the books sent them and will collect the money
      derived from
      
      sales from them from time to time and remit it to you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is another matter: the tariff on books has lately been altered it is now 15
      p.c. this would be 75¢ a vol. on your books—in making out your invoices your proper plan is to put the books in
      at $5.00 per vol. and allow 40 p.c. discount off—this is about the usual discount to the trade—this
      will make the duty 45 cents a vol. So that I should be able to send you $4.05 for each vol. sold.—Please let me know at once if this plan meets your approval
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Many of my friends have an extraordinary curiosity to see you and I hope that you
      will gratify it by paying us your promised visit this summer—Mrs Bucke and the children
      are almost as anxious as I am that you should come—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="man.00005_n1">2. Bucke's lecture on
      Whitman was delivered in London on February 27, 1880, and was reported in detail
      in the London <em>Advertiser</em> on February 28, 1880. This
      report provoked letters of protest in both the <em>Advertiser</em>
      and the London <em>Free Press</em>. Bucke may have sent Whitman a
      copy of the March 12, 1880 <em>Advertiser</em> in which Bucke is
      charged with "dig[ging] up from the gutter a book stained with filth." (See
      Artem Lozynsky, "Walt Whitman in Canada," <em>American Book
         Collector</em> 23 [July–August 1973], 21-23).<a href="#r2">[back]
