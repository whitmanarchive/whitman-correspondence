   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>C. Sadakichi Hartmann (ca.
      1867–1944) was an art historian and early critic of photography as an art
      form. He visited Whitman in Camden in the 1880s and published his conversations
      with the poet in 1895. Generally unpopular with other supporters of the poet, he
      was known during his years in Greenwich Village as the "King of Bohemia." For
      more information about Hartmann, see John F. Roche, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_113.html">Hartmann, C. Sadakichi (ca. 1867–1944)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00748_n1">1. Hartmann includes this
      transcription at the conclusion of his section recounting his conversations with
      Whitman in 1886: "I never corresponded with Whitman; the only communication I
      received from him is a postal card acknowledging receipt of some money for
      several of his books I had bought" (<em>Conversations with Walt
         Whitman</em>, 34). According to Edwin Haviland Miller's tabulation, based
      upon Whitman's letters and his entries in his Commonplace Book, Whitman's income
      in 1886 amounted to at least $2,289.06: royalties, $120.21; lectures, $742.00;
      sales of books, $203.35; payments for articles and poems, $360.00; and gifts,
      $863.50. (The figures on book sales are to some extent conjectural, since Miller
      assumed that Whitman charged a uniform price.)<a href="#r1">[back]
