      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It did me much good to get your Poem—beautiful earnest eloquent words from the
      soul whose dear companionship mine seeks with persistent longing, wrestling with
      distance &amp; time. It seems to me, too, from your having spoken the Poem  yourself I may
      conclude you have made fair progress. What I would fain know is whether you have
      recovered the use of the left side so far as to get about pretty freely, and to have
      as much open air life as you need &amp; like; and also whether you have quite ceased
      to suffer distressing sensations in the [
      <span class="unclear">head. If</span>]
       you can say yes to the first
      question, will you in sign of it put a dash under the word <u>London</u>, &amp; if yes to the second under <u>England</u>
      when you next send me a paper?  Unless indeed the paper itself contain a notice of your health.
      But if it does not that would be an easy way of gladdening me with good news, if
      good news there is. I wish I could send you good letters, dearest Friend, making
      myself the vehicle of what is stirring around me in life &amp; thought that would
      interest you; for there is plenty. But that is very hard to do—though I watch,
      hear, read eagerly full of interest. Everything  stirs in me a cloud of questions, makes
      me want to see its relationship to what I hold already. I am for ever brooding
      pondering, sifting, testing—but that is not the bent of mind that enables one
      to reproduce 
      ones
      
       impressions in compact &amp; lively form. So please dear Friend, be
      indulgent, as indeed I know you will be, of these poor letters of mine with their
      details of my children &amp; their iterated &amp; reiterated expressions of the love
      and hope and aspiration  you have called into life within me—take them not for what they are, but
      for all they have to stand for—Beatrice is at Colne (having got well through the exam: we were anxious
      about in the autumn) and is a very great comfort to my Mother—as I well knew
      she would be; for a more affectionate, devoted, care-taking nature does not
      breathe—with a strong active mental life of her own too. So, though missing
      [
      <span class="unclear">her sorely, I
         am</span>]
      
      
      [
      <span class="unclear">well</span>]
       satisfied
      she should be there; &amp; the country life &amp; rest are doing her a world
      [
      <span class="unclear">of good.</span>]
      
      My artist boy is working away cheerily at the R. Academy,
      his heart in his work. Percy is coming to
      spend Xmas [
      <span class="unclear">with
         us—he, too, continues</span>]
       well content [
      <span class="unclear">with his work</span>]
       and in good health.
      Gracie is blooming. The Rossettis have had a
      heavy affliction this first year of their married [
      <span class="unclear">life in the premature death of</span>]
       her only
      brother—a young man of [
      <span class="unclear">considerable</span>]
      
       promise—barely
      20.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The Conways are well. I feel
      more completely myself than I have done since my illness—so you see dear
      friend if it has taken me quite four years to recover the lost ground one must not
      be discouraged if two do not accomplish it in your case.—I hope your little
      nieces at St. Louis are
      well—and the brothers you are with, and that you have  many dear friends round you at
      Camden.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think my thoughts fly to you on strongest and most joyous wings when I am out
      walking in the clear cold elastic air I enjoy so much.

      Good bye my dearest Friend.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
