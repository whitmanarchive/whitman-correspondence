   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00573_n4">1. This brief letter appears on
      the verso of George Washington Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. This letter is probably the
      one that Edwin Haviland Miller dated to February 24?, 1865 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:376). Miller's date cannot be correct because Louisa's letter
      apologizes for not sending George's letter earlier. The letter from George was
      originally sent to Boston, and Walt remained unaware that his brother had been
      exchanged at least through February 27, 1865. Louisa did not forward the letter
      earlier because she assumed Walt already knew of George's release. According to
      Louisa's  letter to Walt, she
      forwarded George's letter (this one) "yesterday." Therefore, this letter dates
      to March 4, 1865.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00573_n6">2. Walt Whitman remained
      unaware that his brother George Washington Whitman had been exchanged, at least
      as of his  letter to Captain
      William Cook, in which he inquired why George had not "come up with the main
      body, for exchange." The delay between George's sending the letter and Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's forwarding it to Walt was related to two matters: that
      George's letter was "missent to boston" and that George's name appeared in the
      list of released officers in the <em>New York Times</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00573_n17">3. George Washington Whitman's
      name appeared in the list of returned officers. He is listed as "Capt G W
      Whiteman, 51st New York." The list of names took up almost two full columns of
      type. To save space, the standard newspaper column was split into two columns
      divided by a line. In the fifth full column from the edge of the page (the
      left-most column of names in the article), George's name appears 14 names up
      from the bottom of the page ("Our Returned Prisoners," <em>New
         York Times</em>, February 28, 1865, 1).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00573_n15">4. George Washington Whitman
      arrived the next morning. For a detailed description of George's deteriorated
      physical condition upon arrival, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">5. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">6. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00573_n11">7. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      "Sis" is Manahatta "Hattie" Whitman (1860–1886), the older daughter of
      Thomas Jefferson and Martha Mitchell Whitman. The nickname "Sis" would
      eventually pass from Hattie to her younger sister Jessie Louisa, the latter born
      in June 1863. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven years of her life in the
      same home with Louisa Whitman, was especially close to her grandmother. Hattie
      and Jessie Louisa were both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r7">[back]
