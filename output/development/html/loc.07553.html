   <p>A bad spell again—Wednesday was the worst—the light indeed was faintly
      fluctuating several times—but here I am yet—poor enough now but less <em>non</em>-myself—Osler<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r2">2</a></sup> was here last
      evening—He does not apparently think any thing serious—at least nothing
      new—nothing but we knew before—The worst is this inveterate horrible
      costiveness—then the water works give me great annoyance &amp;
      trouble—my strength, equilibrium, power to stand up of my own volition &amp;
      mastery are quite gone—Ed<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r3">3</a></sup> is very good—I gave him
      your little message<sup><a href="#loc.07553_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—he has just helped me to the
      closet, where I tried an injection of soaped warm water but no result at
      all—One thing is I have not eaten any thing for three days—to day three
      or four mouthfuls &amp; a cup of coffee for breakfast—At present moment I am
      sitting in the big chair at the stove alone writing—weather cloudy
      half-&amp;-half—not cold—
   </p>
   
   <p>Your good letter came this morning—I am having some copies of the big book<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      covered in paper &amp; I will send you one, (perhaps two or three) at once—as
      there is some delay ab't the permanent binding—Yes I shall be hard to suit
      with the binding of the b[ig] b[ook]—As I finish the sun bursts out as if it
      meant to stay awhile strong &amp; clear—I am going to stretch out on the bed
      (rest, <em>tide over</em>, <em>lay fallow</em>, &amp;
      such—are probably my best remedies to meet these spells)—
   </p>
   
   <p><em>Saturday, sunset</em>. Dec 1—Last night bad &amp;
      sleepless—up forty to fifty times—water-works irritation,
      scalding—I have been lying on the bed most of the time, but am now sitting
      here by the stove—declining light—rather pleasant weather—not
      cold—no word of O'C[onnor]<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r6">6</a></sup>—

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4302">2. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on
      Osler, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitman-dev.unl.edu/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_202.html">Osler, Dr. William (1849–1919)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4319">3. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r3">[back]

      Whitman of . He writes: "Remember
      me to Ed. Wilkins, tell him that every thing goes quietly along here since he
      left us."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">5. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
