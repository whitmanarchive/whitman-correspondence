   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00462_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd July 24/82." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service Bureau
      | Washington D C. It is postmarked: Philadelphia | Pa. | Jul 21 82 | 11 PM;
      Washington, D.C. | Jul | 22 | 7 AM | 1882 | Recd.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00462_n2">2. In 1888, speaking to
      Horace Traubel, Whitman observed that he had read O'Connor's letter of  "a dozen times" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell
      Kennerley, 1915], 2:60). O'Connor was so vituperative in dealing with Comstock
      that Traubel omitted the following passage: "It a disgrace to the Government
      that they should employ this vile maggot bred from carrion—the rat of the
      cloaca—this lump of devil's-dung."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00462_n3">3. This edition appeared on
      August 4 (see the letter from Whitman to O'Connor of ).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00462_n4">4. On July 7 O'Connor asked
      Whitman to see whether Rees Welsh &amp; Co. had a copy of the first edition of
      Florio's <em>Montaigne</em> (Charles E. Feinberg Collection,
      Library of Congress, Washington D.C.). See also Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, 2:496.<a href="#r4">[back]
