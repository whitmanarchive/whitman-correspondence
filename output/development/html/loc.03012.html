   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br> William Sloane Kennedy,
      biographer, editor, and critic, was one of Whitman's most devoted friends and
      admirers. Kennedy first met Whitman in Philadelphia in 1880 while working on the
      staff of the <em>American</em>. He soon became a frequent
      correspondent and visitor to Whitman's Camden, New Jersey, home, a constant
      contributor of small gifts, and the author of several essays and newspaper
      articles in praise of Whitman. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine
      Reagan,"<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>"" Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03012_n3">1. This postal card is
      addressed: Walt Whitman | Camden | 328 Mickle | N. Jersey. It has a Boston,
      Mass. postmark in which only the city and the year of 1889 are legible. It is
      also postmarked: Camden, N.J. | May | 18 | 1889 | Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03012_n1">2. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4142">3. Whitman had been given a horse and
      buggy in 1885 as the result of a fund-raising drive by friends.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">4. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">6. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.03012_n2">7. Kennedy is referring to an
      obituary for O'Connor that was written by a man named Hurd (see Horace Traubel,
      <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.41.html">Sunday, May 18, 1889)</a>. The author of the obituary may be Charles E.
