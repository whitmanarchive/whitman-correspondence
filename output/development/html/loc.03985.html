   <p>You cannot imagine how bad I was disappointed in not seeing you to night.<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r1">1</a></sup> I went down to the depot to meet you, and not finding you, I thought perhaps you
      came on the 1 O'Clock train, so I went down
      
      
      
      to the house but did not find you. I have been over in the <u>City</u> to day, but did not get any thing to do, I went around untill I got sick and then I came over here. I have been to see <u>several</u> over here but none could give me any encouragement. You may say that I don't care
      for you, but I do. I think of you all the time. I want
      
      
      you to come up to-morrow night if you can. I have been to bed to night, but could not sleep fore thinking of you so I got up and <u>scribbled</u> a few lines to you, to go in the <u>morning</u> mail. I hope you will not disappoint me. I want you to look over the past and I will
      do my best to ward you in the future. You are all the true
      
      
      friend I have, and when I cannot have you I will go away some ware, I don't know where. Mr Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r2">2</a></sup> has been to see me <u>several</u> times since I was away and he lef me a book and a letter, the letter was to inform me of his intention of going back
      to England, I will show it to you when I see you. good bye.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0590">1. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0141b">2. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
