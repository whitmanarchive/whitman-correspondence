      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I thank you for your kind thought of me.<sup><a href="#yal.00467_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I value the photograph
      much, and I wish that I could see not only this sun-picture, excellent as I
      am told it is, but also the living original. May he still live and flourish for
      many years to be. The coming year should give new life to every American
      who has breathed a breath of that soul which inspired the great founders
      of the American Constitution, whose work you are to celebrate. Truly, the
      mother country, pondering on this, may feel that how much soever the 
      daughter owes to her, she, the mother, has, nevertheless, something to
      learn from the daughter. Especially I would note the care taken to guard a 
      noble constitution from rash and unwise innovators.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am always yours,</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809â€“1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00467_n1">1. Walt Whitman sent
      Tennyson one of Cox's photographs. The text of the letter appeared in the <em>New York Tribune</em> on November 22, apparently before Walt
      Whitman received it (see 1634, , William
      D. O'Connor and Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 23 November 1887).<a href="#r1">[back]
