   <p>I was very glad to get a letter from you and should have answered it before this but
      I had to march for New Mexico. Col Canby<sup><a href="#loc.00587_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> who has command of the Union troops in N.M. has had a terrible encounter<sup><a href="#loc.00587_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> with Sibley<sup><a href="#loc.00587_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> of the Texas Rangers. Canby had only eight hundred white men and one Reg of Mexicans
      under the renowned <em>Kit Carson</em>
      <sup><a href="#loc.00587_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>. Sibley had three thousand men our white men done all the fighting for the Mexicans
      broke and ran at the first fire our men fought like tigers one company of Pikes Peak
      Boys<sup><a href="#loc.00587_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> was cut to peases only seventeen survived the fight&nbsp; they emptied thirty five Texas saddles the first
      fire and loss of killed and wounded was about 225 the Texans about 400 as soon as
      we heard of the battle we made a forced march to the rescue and marched a Reg of men
      350 miles in 14 days we marched 120 miles in three days and 80 miles in 24 hours.
      I think we made the biggest march on record, we understood that Sibley was making
      an attack on Fort Union<sup><a href="#loc.00587_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup> the word came to us about sundown after the men had marched 40 miles and had not had
      their supper and they threw their hats in the air and swore they would march 40 miles
      farther before they slept and they did&nbsp; they started off singing the Star spangled
      banner, Red White &amp; Blue and Yankee doodle&nbsp; so you can imagine what kind of material
      this Reg is composed of&nbsp; we are now at Ft Union without a fight but start in three
      days to attack Sibley where I expect we shall have as great a battle as ever was known.
   </p>
   
   <p>Soldiering suits me although it is rather rough at present. we have travelled through
      mountains and plains and seen many amusing things&nbsp; we have a splendid chance to study
      human nature for we have all kinds of men in the Reg we are within one hundred miles
      of Santa Fe which I suppose is taken by the Texans by this time. men women and children
      and thousands of head of stock arrive here dailey from that country they are all glad to see the soldiers thre or four companies of the 5th infantry Regulars will march with us we go abreast to
      Santa Fe. I am afraid this letter will not be very interesting for I dont feel like writing

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Silas S. Soule (1838-1865)
      was raised by an abolitionist father, Amasa Soule, who moved the Soule family to
      Kansas to help fight for Kansas's anti-slavery status. With his father and
      brother William, Silas was a member of the "Jayhawkers," a band of abolitionists
      who assisted slaves through the Underground Railroad. Silas was among the Kansas
      team assembled and brought to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania by Richard Swinton to
      break John Brown's accomplices Albert Hazlett and Aaron Stevens out of jail in
      Charlestown, Virginia (now West Virginia). In Harrisburg he would have met
      William W. Thayer, who helped Richard Hinton and Thomas Wentworth Higginson plan
      the jailbreak. On February 18, 1860, Soule went to Charlestown from Harrisburg
      and faked public intoxication in order to be imprisoned in the same jail as
      Hazlett and Stevens, only to be talked out of the jailbreak by them. Soule
      attended a public memorial for Hazlett and Stevens in Boston, where Thayer and
      Eldridge were in attendance. After the death of his father in 1860, Soule
      followed the gold rush to Denver, but enlisted in the Union army as soon as news
      of the war reached him. In 1864 Soule defied orders by refusing to join Colonel
      John M. Chivington's attack on a group of unarmed native americans, which later
      came to be known as the Sand Creek Massacre. Soule would later testify against
      Chivington in hearings in Denver. Soule married Hersa Coberly, the daughter of a
      pioneer family, on April 1, 1865. Three weeks later he was murdered on the
      streets of downtown Denver by a private from the Second Colarado infantry and an
      accomplice.
