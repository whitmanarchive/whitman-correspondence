   </p>
   
   
   <p>I write this lying in bed yet—but I sit up several times during the day now, for a
      few minutes at a time—am gradually gaining the use of my left arm &amp; leg—(the
      right side has not been affected at all)—think I shall be able to move round a little
      by Sunday—The Doctor has just been—he says I am doing very well—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>John Burroughs<sup><a href="#yal.00405_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> is here temporarily—he comes in
      often—Eldridge<sup><a href="#n0210" id="r3">3</a></sup> and Peter Doyle are regular still, helping &amp;
      lifting &amp; nursing me—but I feel now that I shall soon be able to help
      myself—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I slept quite well last night—It has been very cold indeed here, they say—but I
      have not felt it—as I write, it looks pleasant &amp; bright, the sun shining in real
      cheerful—I see by Sister Lou's letter that you had no news from St. Louis—poor,
      poor Mat<sup><a href="#n0707" id="r4">4</a></sup>, I think about her often, as I am lying here—I have not written to Han since
      I had the paralysis—Mother, you might send one of my letters to her, Han<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r5">5</a></sup>, when you next write—(this one, or any)—Say I sent my love,
      &amp; will be up before long—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, mother dear, &amp; Sister Lou<sup><a href="#n0368" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; Brother George<sup><a href="#n0700" id="r7">7</a></sup>, I will close for the present, for this week—Will write
      Sunday—but I understand the mails are a little irregular this weather—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0210">3. Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

   <p id="n0707">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman (d. 1873) known as "Mattie,"
      was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and
      Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
      the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat
      ailment that would lead to her death in 1873.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n0285">5. Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908),
      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0368">6. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n0700">7. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
