      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you by this mail a copy of one essay of mine which is just published<sup><a href="#loc.04081_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I do not know whether it will be of any interest to you—it ought to be for it was
      inspired directly by yourself—it is part of a book which I have been engaged upon
      for about six years—the book is on "Man's Moral Nature." this book as I say was inspired
      by yourself about six years ago in the city of London England.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This is a payment of that truth which is said to be stranger than fiction.</p>
   
   
   <p>I hope to publish the book in a year or at most two from this time and I intend if
      you do not object to dedicate it to you.<sup><a href="#loc.04081_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> This letter has rather a mysterious air about it especially as being written by a
      "materialist" to a "materialist"<sup><a href="#loc.04081_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> Some day if ever we meet again as I trust we shall I will explain it.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04081_n5">1. The letter is on
      printed stationary from the Asylum in Hamilton. Bucke has deleted "Hamilton" and
      written in "London." Bucke had moved from Hamilton to London in February 1877,
      but was still apparently using left-over stationary. The letter is endorsed, in
      Whitman's hand: Dr Bucke | Nov 4 '77.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04081_n1">2. "The Function of the
      Great Sympathetic Nervous System" (<em>American Journal of
         Insanity</em>, 43 (October 1877), 115–59).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04081_n4">3. <em>Man's
         Moral Nature</em> bears the following dedication: "I dedicate this book to
      the man who inspired it—to the man who of all men past and present that I
      have known has the most exalted moral nature—to WALT WHITMAN" (v).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04081_n3">4. Bucke's philosophical
      materialism is clearly expressed in his epigraph from Comte: "Les régions
      speculative et active du cerveau n'ont de communcations nerveuses qu'avec les
      sens et les muscles pour aperçevoir et modifier le monde exterieur" (<em>Man's Moral Nature</em> [New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1879],
      2). The application of the term to Whitman is less clear.<a href="#r4">[back]
