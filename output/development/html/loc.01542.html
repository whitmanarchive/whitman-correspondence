      <br></br><br></br>Dear son,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter rec'd this morning, speaks of the mild weather there—but it has been &amp;
      remains 
      very cold here—so much so that I don't go around half as much as I would like. My
      cold hangs 
      on, though not so bad as at first. The state of the weather, &amp; my cold, &amp;c. have rather
      blocked 
      me from having my usual enjoyment here, so far—but I expect to make up for it by and
      by.
      
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>Dear son, I see you are off<sup><a href="#loc.01542_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I take it by your letter that you are feeling well in health, 
      and having as good a time as the law allows—I wish we could be together there, some
      of these
      moonlight nights—but here it is too cold for comfort—(the water pipes here froze again
      last night, 
      causing trouble)—I go out a couple of hours middle of the day, but keep in nights—
      
   </p>  
   
   
   <p>—I have got the new edition of my book under way,—&amp; it will be satisfactory I think—It
      will be in one volume, 
      &amp; will make a better appearance than any of the former ones—Do you go up to the debates
      in the Senate—I see by the papers they are having high times—Senator Schurz appears
      to come out ahead of them all—he is a real good speaker—I enjoy the way he shakes
      them up, (very much like a first-class 
      terrier in a pit, with a lot of rats)<sup><a href="#loc.01542_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, I send you $10 enclosed, as you may need it—Should you want more, you write,
      as I have plenty—I am writing this up in my back room, home—have had a nice breakfast
      of hot potatoes &amp; first-rate Oregon 
      salmon—with the best coffee thats made—home-made bread, &amp; sweet butter—every thing
      tip-top—get along well enough—you must try to do the same—so good bye, for this time,
      my own loving boy—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <p id="loc.01542_n2">2. Senator Carl Schurz
      (1829–1906), of Missouri, alleged that since the U.S. had violated its
      neutrality in the 1870 war by selling arms to French agents, Germany could bring
      claims for damages against the American government. Schurz's opponents charged
      that he had falsified documents. The New York <em>Times</em> on
      February 23 declared: "Schurz was the greatest toady any President ever had
      until he failed to get all the offices he wanted, and then he turned round and
      became a 'patriot' and a 'reformer.'"<a href="#r2">[back]
