   <p>The syndicate is dissolved. Mr. Rice<sup><a href="#n6004" id="r1">1</a></sup> furnishes articles for the <u>Star</u> only. The price of your article<sup><a href="#loc.03292_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> puts it outside of any possible use
      for it in that paper, as the highest price is $10 per thousand. Just wait a few
      days, however, and I will read it and see if it will not do for the North American.
      Your Burns article will be, I expect, in the November number.<sup><a href="#loc.03292_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Redpath (1833–1891),
      an antislavery activist, journalist, and longtime friend of Whitman, was the
      author of <em>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown</em> (Boston:
      Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the <em>New York
         Tribune</em> during the war, and the originator of the "Lyceum" lectures. He
      met Whitman in Boston in 1860 and remained an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 9
      vols., 3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp." Redpath became
      editor of <em>The North American Review</em> in November 1886. See
      also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins, 1926);

         Making of Nineteenth-Century America</em> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University
      Press, 2008); and J.R. LeMaster, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_46.html">Redpath, James [1833–1891]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n6004">1. Charles Allen Thorndike Rice
      (1851–1889) purchased <em>The North American Review</em> in
      1876 and was its publisher, editor, and overall proprietor until his death in
      1889.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.03292_n1">2. After <em>Harper's</em> had rejected Whitman's "Some War Memoranda," Whitman
      submitted it to Redpath, and it appeared in the <em>North American
         Review</em> in January 1887. Whitman received $60 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r2">[back]
