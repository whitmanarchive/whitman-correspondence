   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00585_n9">1. This letter dates to October
      19, 1969. October 19 fell on a Tuesday in the year 1869, which is consistent
      with the year added in Richard Maurice Bucke's hand. Edwin Haviland Miller cited
      Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). The declining possibility
      that daughter-in-law Martha Mitchel "Mattie" Whitman would visit Brooklyn during
      the winter and lingering concerns about the health of daughter Hannah Whitman
      Heyde, whose thumb had been amputated the previous December, are consistent with
      the year.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00585_n13">2. Louisa wrote the letter
      "s" in her spelling "magsine" over her letter "a."<br><br>
      <em>Harper's Weekly Magazine</em> debuted in 1857. Though
      designed like its sister monthly to promote British reprints, <em>Harper's Weekly</em> was notable for its Civil War
      coverage and began publishing American writers in the ensuing decades. Walt
      Whitman's poem "Beat! Beat! Drums!" appeared in the September 28, 1861 issue
      of the newspaper, and two poems by Whitman were first published in the
      periodical in the 1880s (for all works by Whitman, see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_titles/per.00162.html"><em>Harper's Weekly Magazine</em></a>).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00585_n17">3. The application of a
      poultice made from ground or powdered slippery elm bark was a common herbal
      treatment for swelling and infection in the nineteenth century.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00585_n7">4. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt
      Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa.
      In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved
      there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie
      had a long-term cough and throat ailment that would lead to her death in
      February 1873, and she returned to Brooklyn in late-October 1869 and remained
      through late-December for medical treatment. Walt Whitman reported on Mattie's
      medical condition to her husband, his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman,
      in his  letter. For more on
      Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of
         Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      1–26.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n11">5. Helen Price was the
      daughter of Abby and Edmund Price. Abby Price and her family, especially her
      daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman and his mother, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman. Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform
      movements. Price's husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and
      the couple had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in
      1852, at 2 years of age). In 1860, the Price family began to save Walt's
      letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman were included in Richard Maurice
      Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1883), and she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters to
      her mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n4">6. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00585_n1">7. Samuel W. Thayer, a
      Professor of Anatomy at the University of Vermont Medical School, performed
      surgeries in Burlington, Vermont during the 1860s. A serious thumb infection in
      late 1868 led Dr. Thayer to lance Hannah (Whitman) Heyde's wrist in November. In
      early December, he amputated Hannah's thumb. For Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      report to Walt Whitman on the initial surgery from a non-extant letter by
      Charles L. Heyde, see her  letter to Walt Whitman. Walt inquired of Dr. Thayer with regard
      to Hannah's health on .<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n6">8. Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975), 10–11.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00585_n14">9. "Burlng" is a shortened
      form of Burlington, the Vermont residence of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      youngest daughter Hannah Heyde and Hannah's husband Charles L. Heyde
      (1822–1890).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">10. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00585_n15">11. Ansel Van Nostrand was the
      husband of Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van Nostrand (1821–1899), Louisa's
      eldest daughter and Walt Whitman's younger sister.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00585_n18">12. Based on Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's phrase, this John is probably the husband to the third daughter of
      Ansel and Mary Whitman Van Nostrand, Louisa Van Nostrand. For more on Mary's
      daughter Louisa, see <em>Some Notes on Whitman's Family,
         Monographs on Unpublished Whitman Material</em>, no. 2 (Brooklyn: Comet
      Press, 1941), 4.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00585_n20">13. According to the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, the term delerium tremens
      (trembling delirium) is used in medical Latin to describe severe symptoms of
      alcohol withdrawal, which are characterized by violent shakes and
      delusions.<br><br>
      It is possible that Louisa struck through the "s" in her spelling "tremes"
      and inserted the letters "man" to make the form "tremman"; more likely, she
      inscribed a separating line between her word "tremes" and the inserted word
      "man" below. The inserted word "man" concerns her son-in-law Ansel Van
      Nostrand's having been demoted from a "master mason" to a "common man" is
      his Masonic lodge.<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00585_n26">14. For Ansel Van Nostrand's
      participation in a Masonic lodge, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt
      Whitman.<br><br>
      It is possible that the word "man" in the phrase "common man" was inserted to
      complete the phrase "deliru tremman" in the previous line (see note
      above).<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00585_n2">15. William D. O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was one of Walt Whitman's staunchest defenders, and Walt was
      also close with William's wife Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor. Whitman dined with the
      O'Connors frequently during his Washington years, and he wrote often in his
      letters of their daughter Jean "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William
      O'Connor would break in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to
      emancipated black citizens, Ellen remained friendly with Whitman. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r15">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00585_n3">16. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      refers here to Ellen M. O'Connor's sister, Mary Jane "Jeannie" (Tarr) Channing
      (1828–1897). Walt Whitman visited often with Mary Jane and her husband Dr.
      William Ellery Channing during his October 1868 visit to Providence, Rhode
      Island (see Walt's  letter to
      Peter Doyle).<a href="#r16">[back]
