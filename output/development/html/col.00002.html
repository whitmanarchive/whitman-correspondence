      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Conway,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send (in the mail for printed matter,) same time as this, duplicate printed copies
      of a poem I have written, "Passage to India," in which I endeavor to celebrate in
      my
      own way, the modern engineering masterpieces, the Pacific Railroad &amp; the Suez
      Canal—in fact the great modern material practical energy &amp;
      works—&amp; then make of them as heights &amp; apices whereby to reach freest,
      widest, loftiest spiritual fields. But you will see what I have written. It will
      make from 12 to 14, 15, or 16 ordinary pages.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Can I take the liberty of asking you to seek to dispose of the piece, if eligible,
      to
      some London magazine? It will not be printed here in any magazine—I reserve
      the right to print it in future book. The price, time, selection of magazine, and
      in
      fact all the points of that sort, I leave absolutely to you—<sup><a href="#col.00002_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>My address remains as before at this office &amp; city. Nothing new or very different
      with my affairs. I remain in good health &amp; spirits.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="col.00002_n1">1. Moncure Conway acted as
      Walt Whitman's agent in England. He was not able to sell the poem to an English
      journal. Burroughs observed in the second edition of his <em>Notes
         on Walt Whitman as a Poet and Person</em> (1871): "The manuscript of
      'Passage to India' was refused by the monthly magazines successively in New
      York, Boston, San Francisco, and London" (123).<a href="#r1">[back]
