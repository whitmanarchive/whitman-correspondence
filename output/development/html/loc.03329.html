      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>These last days have been so crowded with work &amp; play, that there has been no fair
      chance to do any writing. What with Stedman<sup><a href="#n1043" id="r1">1</a></sup>—who celebrated my 
      last night in America yesterday by toasting me with mint-juleps at the Hoffman House,
      &amp; Col. Bob Ingersoll,<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r2">2</a></sup> who has been
      
      giving me all sorts of wrinkles in oratory at his own house &amp; in public (It was a
      great experience to hear him speak to an audience of 
      actors at Madison Square Theatre on Tuesday,)—&amp; what with endless other episodes of
      a friendly &amp; delightful kind, it 
      is a wonder that I have the heart to say goodbye to America at all. At last the end
      has come however. I sail by the Crystal this 
      afternoon at 3 o'clock for Leith, &amp; with this news I must now say once more Goodbye,
      &amp; be silent again for a while.
   </p>

      With much love!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1043">1. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="n0839">2. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r2">[back]
