      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Bishop Potter<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r1">1</a></sup> suggests that a short letter giving your ideas how
      best "To lift, how little howsoe'er, the hearts of toilers struggling here," would
      perhaps be a better idea than the one suggested in my previous letter. I should like
      to hear from you in response to either of these questions. A letter of one hundred
      words would perhaps be sufficiently long for this purpose.
   </p>

      Very truly yours,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Samuel Sidney McClure
      (1857â€“1949) was the co-founder and editor of <em>McClure's
         Magazine</em>. Well-known for its investigative journalism, the illustrated
      monthly initially rejected Whitman's submissions and only posthumously published
      some of his poetry (in 1897).
