      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received the "Camden Post" on Tuesday morning, the 26th inst, and in the evening
      of
      the same day I received the "Camden Morning News"—the "screed" from "The
      Critic"—and your post card—in reply to which latter I wired to you at
      once.—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>It isn't possible for me to write much at present. I have read all the pieces you
      sent—especially the letter to "The Critic."—It suggests some points I should like to write
      about, but I must only note <u>one</u>—and that is your
      remark that you are "still rejected by the great magazines" +c.—Well—so
      much the worse for <u>them</u>! It is only of a piece with your
      continued rejection by some of your leading men of letters and the absurdly
      inadequate recognition of those who seem friendly.—I could wish it were
      otherwise,—and that the solitude of soul in which you have lived might at
      last, in your old age, be cheered by the advent of a completely intelligent +
      loving recognition + response. That you are still, in a great degree, "despised +
      rejected of men" is, however, only the price you pay for your greatness, and
      corresponds with the experience of other great benefactors + redeemers.—But
      there is a wise encompassing Love which transcends all our thinking—"Love like
      the light silently wrapping all"—which holds both yourself + your work in safe
      and tender keeping—Future generations will love you all the more passionately
      for your rejection by your contemporaries, and we who have already come to partly
      understand you and to love you also love you more proudly and tenderly because of it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your great kindness—most fatherly, most tender—to D<u>r</u> Johnston<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r1">1</a></sup> + myself stirs my heart more deeply than I
      can tell you. We thought it a precious privilege to minister, in however slight a
      degree to <u>you</u>, and, behold! you <u>load</u> us in return with the most unlooked for and unmerited kindnesses!
      Thanks to you from my heart—and God bless you!
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>I cannot write more now but I think I will send you a slip I cut from a newspaper
      last Decbr. I thought of sending it to you at the time + will now do so.—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
