   <p>Here is for your edition, a special concluding note<sup><a href="#nyp.00577_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> to "Specimen Days"—a short
      Preface for it I have already sent you<sup><a href="#nyp.00577_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—also I suppose you have rec'd the
      parcel of pictures I sent you—Nothing very new with me—I have been
      lately ab't the same as usual, but am quite unwell to-day—I shall send an
      additional paper or so to eke out the "Democratic Vistas" volume—I told you in
      the former note that I gave you power to decide in such exigencies as always occur
      in book publishing, &amp; I confirm it—
