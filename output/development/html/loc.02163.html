      <br></br><br></br>Dear Herb
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will just write a line to put in your mother's letter—I am well as usual—we have
      had three awful hot days &amp; nights, (but I have stood 'em capitally) up to last evening,
      when it rained hard, &amp; though warm enough yet again, it is now quite tolerable—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been here 24 hours—(go back to Camden this evening)—your mother, &amp; Bee &amp; Giddy
      are very well—I am writing this up in the 
      
      
      
      bow window room—it is jolly up here—I slept like a top last night—we all sat in the
      big room in the dark, till 10—(had to put down the windows it was so coolish &amp; windy)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Herb your creek picture looks steadily good—don't give out the more you are acquainted
      with it, &amp; examine it—seems to me indeed a <u>true bit of nature</u>—I miss the creek &amp; spring—Miss my dear friends at the house—shall write to Mrs Stafford
      probably same mail with this—rec'd your letter— &amp; thank you for it—as I close it is 6 o'clock, &amp; a fine evening—
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>Love to you from your old Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02163_n1">1. On Saturday, July 28,
      Whitman stayed at the Gilchrists', and Herbert was at Kirkwood with the
      Staffords. Whitman also noted in his Commonplace Book that from July 22 to 30 it
      was "very hot—therm 90-96—in Camden" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
