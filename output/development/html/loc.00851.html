   </p>
   
   <p>I am disconsolate at your long stay.  What has become of you?  On returning the 7th
      of July I found you had gone home sick.  You have no business to be sick, so I expect
      you are well.  I was so unlucky as to be sick myself all the time I was home—and most
      of the time since I came back.  I am quite well now, however, and feel like myself.
      Benton<sup><a href="#loc.00851_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> and I looked for you at 
      Leedsvill
      
      , as I wrote to you to come.  If you have leisure now, you would enjoy hugely a visit
      up there.  I hope you are printing Drum Taps, and that this universal drought does
      not reach your "grass."  But make haste and come back.  The heat is delicious  I have
      a constant bath in my own perspiration.  I was out at the front during the <em>siege of Washington</em> and lay in the rifle pits with the
      
      
      
      soldiers.  I got quite a taste of war and learned the song of those modern minstrels—the
      minnie bullets—by heart.  A line from you would be prized.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Burroughs
      (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864, even
      though Burroughs had frequented Pfaff's beer cellar, where he consistently
      defended Whitman's poetry, in 1862. After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman
      commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs
      was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the correspondence between the two
      men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would
      write several books involving or devoted to Whitman's work: <em>Birds and Poets</em> (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1877), <em>Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</em> (New York: American News Co.,
      1867), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1896),
      and <em>Accepting the Universe</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1920). For more information on Burroughs see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John (1837–1921) and Ursula
         (1836–1917)</a>.
