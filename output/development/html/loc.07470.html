   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07470_n1">1. This letter is addressed:

      | Dec 2(?) | 8 PM | 88.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n4130">2. Elizabeth Fairchild was the wife
      of Colonel Charles Fairchild, the president of a paper company, to whom Whitman
      sent the Centennial Edition on March 2, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). He mailed her husband a copy of <em>Progress</em> in April, 1881, shortly after his visit to
      Boston, where he probably met the Fairchilds for the first time (Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07470_n2">3. Whitman is referring to
      his poem "To the Year 1889" (later titled "To the Pending Year") which appeared
      in <em>The Critic</em> on January 5, 1889 (see his letter to Bucke
      of ). He received $6 for the
      piece (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
