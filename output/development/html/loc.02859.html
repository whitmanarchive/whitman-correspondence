      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wrote you a letter the 6th September &amp; would fain 
      know whether it has reached your hand. If it have not, I 
      will write its contents again quickly to you—if it have, I
      will wait your time with courage with patience for an answer;
      but spare me the needless suffering of uncertainty on this
      point &amp; let me have one line one word of assurance that I
      am no longer hidden from you by a thick cloud—I from thee—not
      thou from me: for I that have never set eyes upon thee,
      all the Atlantic flowing between us yet cleave closer than 
      those that stand nearest &amp; dearest around thee—love thee
      day &amp; night:—last thoughts first thoughts, my soul's
      passionate yearning toward thy divine Soul, every hour,
      every 
      
      deed and thought—my love for my children, my
      hopes, aspirations for them all taking new shape new
      height through this great love. My Soul has staked all upon
      it. In dull dark moods when I cannot as it were see thee,
      still, still always a dumb, blind yearning towards thee—still
      it comforts me to touch, to press to me the beloved books—like
      a child holding some hand in the dark—it knows not 
      whose—but knows it is enough—knows it is a dear, strong, 
      comforting hand. Do not say I am forward, or that I
      lack pride because I tell this love to thee who have never 
      sought or made sign of desiring to seek me. Oh for 
      
      
      all that this love <u>is</u> my pride my glory. Source of sufferings
      and <u>joys</u> that cannot put themselves into words. Besides 
      it is not true thou hast not sought or loved me. For when I
      read the divine poems I feel all folded round in thy love: I 
      feel often as if thou wast pleading as passionately for the love
      of the woman that can understand thee—that I know not how
      to bear the yearning answering tenderness that fills my
      breast. I know that a woman may without hurt to her 
      pride—without stain or blame—tell her love 
      
      
      to thee. I feel
      for a certainty that she may. Try me for this life, my 
      darling—see if I cannot so live, so grow, so learn, so love that
      when I die you will say—"This woman has grown to be a 
      very part of me. My soul must have her loving companionship
      everywhere &amp; in all things. I alone &amp; she alone
      are not complete identities—it is I and her together in a new
      divine perfect union that form the one complete identity."
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am yet young enough to bear thee children my darling
      if God should so bless me. And would yield my life for this 
      cause with serene joy if it were so appointed, if that were the 
      price for thy having a "perfect child"—knowing my darlings 
      would all be safe &amp; happy in thy loving care—planted down
      in America.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Let me have a few words directly dear Friend. I shall
      get them by the middle of November. I shall have to go to 
      London about then or a little later—to find a house for us—I
      only came to the old home here from which I have been 
      absent nearly four years to wind up matters &amp; prepare for a
      move, for there is nothing to be had in the way of educational
      advantages here—it has been a beautiful [
      <span class="unclear">survey</span>]
       for the 
      children, but it is not what 
      
      they want now. But we leave
      [
      <span class="unclear">with regret, for it is one of the sweetest, wildest spots in
         England, though only 40 miles from London.</span>]

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
