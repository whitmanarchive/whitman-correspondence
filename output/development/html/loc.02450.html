      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thanks to you for your kind p.c. of the 18<u>th</u> inst. received
      this morning, from which I am sorry to learn that you were still troubled with the
      grippe etc.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The reading of your p.c. inspired me with a great longing desire to go to you + to
      do
      something to help you in your trouble.
   </p>
   
   <p>How I envy H. T.<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      <u>his</u> great privilege + wish that I could be with you as he
      is! But I am heartily
      glad to know that he <u>is</u> with you daily + I have no doubt
      that his presence is a great comfort to you.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>By this time you will I trust, be in possession of my printed notes and of the
      numbers of <u>Great Thoughts</u> containing Edmund Mercer's
      article upon yourself.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have discovered that he is a young solicitor residing in Manchester which is 11
      miles from Bolton. I have been favoured with two letters from him in one of which
      he
      says:—
   </p>
   
   <p>"Since I first read any of Whitman's poems—5 years ago—I have always more
      or less admired him &amp; a profound knowledge serves to increase that admiration . . . . . I feel to
      him just now as though he were my grandfather or an aged uncle; as though I once
      knew him but my remembrances were like an infant's."
   </p>
   
   <p>He further says that he has long cherished a desire to write to you and had at
      last—thanks to my sending <u>Great Thoughts</u> to
      you—"screwed his courage to the sticking place" to do so.
   </p>
   
   <p>He seems to be a genuinely good fellow + has a deep regard for you.</p>
   
   <p>Thank you also for your kindness in promising to send me a copy of the Ingersoll<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r2">2</a></sup> Lecture. Might I ask you to send one also to J. W. Wallace<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r3">3</a></sup> +
      I will remit the cash on receipt?
   </p>
   
   <p>We had our first fall of snow here today, + very beautiful did the outside world
      look, all robed in its white mantle of purity, glorified into dazzling splendour by
      the radiant beams of the great "silent sun."
   </p>
   
   <p>A similar occasion last year on my birthday Dec. 8<u>th</u>
      suggested the enclosed "Snow Thought"
   </p>
   
   <p>It is now a lovely moonlight night + I have just returned from a most enjoyable
      walk—a professional call—+ the tramp along the snow-caked glistening
      road + through the keen, frosty air has exhilirated me + sent the warm blood
      tingling to my finger tips.
      Novr 29<u>th</u> 1890 I have today
      heard from JWW—to whom I conveyed your loving salutation—that along with
      his copy of the <u>Conservator</u> is another marked copy which
      he presumes that you have sent for me. Thank you for it!
   </p>
   
   <p>Our Librarian informs me that there is a poem of yours in one of this month's
      magazines—probably <u>Scribner's</u>—but I have not
      seen it yet

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4267">1. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0839">2. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6121">3. James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
