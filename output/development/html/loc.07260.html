   <p>All very quiet, rainy weather still continued though varied by an occasional fine
      day. Nothing more from W. Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r2">2</a></sup> but I expect each mail to get a
      letter which will fix the time of my departure for the East (always supposing I get
      leave of absence). No word has reached from O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r3">3</a></sup> since the
      little scrap I sent you some days since, I feel very
      uneasy about him and wish I could run down to Washington to see him while
      I am East but I fear that will be impossible, my time will be short and there will
      be a great deal to do. Your last letter to me was written a week ago today I hope
      one will cross this if so I will write  again at once. In any case will write as soon as I hear from W.
      Gurd to tell you what the prospects are in re going East.

   <p>I have been wondering lately how it came that so much of the mythology of the old
      Greeks, especially the Herakleian-Zodiacal myths came from Semitic-Chaldean sources?
      Could the Greeks have mixed with a Semitic people while in western Asia, before the
      Homeric age? And was this blending of the two high races one cause (hybridization
      is the great secret of advance in the whole organic world) of the extraordinary elevation
      of the Periclean Greeks?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4284">2. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
