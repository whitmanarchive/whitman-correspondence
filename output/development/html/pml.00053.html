   <p id="pml.00053_n1">2. Whitman wrote on the same
      day in his Commonplace Book: "Am slowly getting better." On November 6 he
      observed: "to-day, well as usual, before sickness." The Camden <em>Daily Post</em> on November 1 noted the poet's "reappearance on the
      street," and "Walt Whitman's Illness" appeared in the <em>Progress</em> on November 9 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
