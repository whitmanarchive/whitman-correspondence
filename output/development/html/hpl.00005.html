   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4126">1. William J. "Billy" Thompson
      (1848–1911), known as "The Duke of Gloucester" and "The Statesman," was a
      friend of Whitman's who operated a hotel, race track, and amusement park on the
      beach overlooking the Delaware River at Gloucester, New Jersey. His shad and
      champagne dinners for Whitman were something of a tradition. See William Sloane
      Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> (1896),
      15–16.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hpl.00005_n1">2. The diners included
      Thomas B. Harned, James Matlack Scovel, Judge Hugg, and William Duckett
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Whitman
      had also gone to Thompson's at Gloucester, N.J., on April 24, 1886 (See
      Whitman's letter to Kennedy of ).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hpl.00005_n4">3. A year prior, Whitman noted
      in his Commonplace Book that he had a "planked shad &amp; champagne dinner at
      Billy Thompson's" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4979">4. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02189_n1">5. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hpl.00005_n2">6. Whitman has inadvertently
      written "Logan" here instead of "Lloyd." Lloyd Smith was Robert Pearsall Smith's
      brother and a librarian; Logan Smith was Robert's son.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hpl.00005_n3">7. The paper included "The
      Good Gray Poet Is White Now," an account of Whitman's lecture entitled "The
      Death of Abraham Lincoln," delivered in New York City on Thursday, April 14,
      1887.<a href="#r7">[back]
