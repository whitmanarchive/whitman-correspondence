      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Truly this has been a "red letter day" for me! This morning's post brought a letter
      from Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; the noon post a post card<sup><a href="#loc.02443_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; newspaper from you &amp; a book packet from the
      good doctor containing a copy of "Man's Moral Nature"<sup><a href="#loc.02443_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> a
      newspaper with a story by Dr B. &amp; two pamphlets also by him! Also a copy of the
      original preface to "L of G" 1855.<sup><a href="#loc.02443_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>First let me thank you most cordially for your kindness &amp; for your kind words of
      approval of the photos.<sup><a href="#loc.02443_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> I am glad you like them and
      since you thus encourage me I shall take the liberty of sending you a few more
      before long which I think will interest you
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I feel very highly honored by your wish to utilize my copy of the 1890 photo in your
      forthcoming annex.<sup><a href="#loc.02443_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup> I shall send you the "plate" or
      negative probably by next mail &amp; you may keep it &amp; use it as you think best.
      It is not on glass but on the new substitute celluloid which has the advantage of
      being flexible while retaining its transparency, but it is used exactly in the same
      way as an ordinary glass negative &amp; any photographer can print from it by
      inserting it behind a sheet of clean glass in the printing frame
   </p>
   
   
   <p>By the way I noticed that Mr Wallace's<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r7">7</a></sup> large photo is
      "copyrighted" by the photographer. I don't know how this will
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>affect your reproducing my copy of it but you will know best. Pardon my mentioning
      it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am glad to hear that you are keeping "well" from wh' I conclude that you have
      recovered from your attack of the grippe<sup><a href="#loc.02445_n6" id="r8">8</a></sup> &amp; I
      sincerely hope that your health may continue to improve. May the coming Winter treat
      you kindly &amp; may naught but good be yours.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had a visit the other day from Captain Nowell<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r9">9</a></sup> of the <u>S</u>.<u>S</u>. "British Prince" with whom
      I went to Philadelphia. He was present, along with Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r10">10</a></sup>, at your Birthday Banquet 1889<sup><a href="#loc.07305_n2" id="r11">11</a></sup>
      &amp; was introduced to you
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>he sails again on Wed Sept 24th (due Phila. about Oct 6th) &amp; will probably call
      upon you on account of Mr Wallace &amp; myself, if it will not be troubling you too
      much to see him for a few minutes.<sup><a href="#loc.02445_n7" id="r12">12</a></sup> He is a downright
      good fellow—and a handsome fellow into the bargain!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope "Warry"<sup><a href="#loc.00668_n4" id="r13">13</a></sup> received the book on "Massage" all
      right<sup><a href="#loc.02443_n8" id="r14">14</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Will you please kindly put me down as a subscriber for your new book<sup><a href="#loc.02443_n9" id="r15">15</a></sup> &amp; I will forward the cash as soon as I know the
      price?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am extremely pleased with Dr Bucke's most kind letter. He gives me some details
      of
      poor W.D. O'Connor's<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r16">16</a></sup> illness &amp; death which have a sad
      interest. His death must have been a great blow to you &amp; a loss to all who knew
      him. John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r17">17</a></sup> told me a good
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>deal about him &amp; of the wordy encounters you &amp; he used to engage in at times.
      His (O'C's) intellect must have been of an exceptionally high order—J.B. said
      it was "like a damascus blade, so keen, incisive &amp; penetrating"—he must
      have been an altogether unique man upon whose like we shall not soon gaze again.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am glad to hear that "Warry" &amp; Mrs Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r18">18</a></sup> like the
      photographs &amp; that they are both well.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Please kindly give my regards to them &amp; to all the household</p>

      With continued reverential love to yourself
      <br></br>I remain

   <p>P.S. The boys are anticipating a pleasant evening on Sept 25th when they mean to
      give the Revd FRC Hutton MA<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r19">19</a></sup> a "Surprise Party" on his
      Birthday. Our Birthday present is the copy of the Pocket book edition of L of G
      which was ordered by cablegram
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As a little set off to some of those "sharp notices" of which you remark in
      J.W.W.'s p.c. here is an extract from an article entitled "Carlyle &amp; old
      women" by P.W. Roose in this months <u>National</u>
      <u>Review</u></p>
   
   
   <p>" 'My imagination like my heart has always been with the women—I mean the
      young for I cannot separate that
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>adjective from that substantive'. So at that advanced age wrote Landor. In
      dramatically opposite spirit the more homely, yet more imaginative, American
      bard Walt Whitman sets forth his dictum—
      "Women sit or move to &amp; fro some old some young
      <br>The young are beautiful but the old are more beautiful than the young"
      "

   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>P.P.S. Since writing this letter I have been over to Anderton and have spent a
      delightful afternoon with J.W.W. in charming Rivington—a rural district
      close to Anderton full of delights for Nature-lovers. It has been a splendid
      September afternoon—a veritable halcyon day such as we have had many this
      month—the sun shining with tempered power, a fine fresh breeze blowing in
      our faces &amp; swaying the great arms of the autumn-tinted, majestic trees,
      swallows darting &amp; screaming overhead, wagtails running across our path,
      songsters twittering in the hedgerows. We walked together through the fields
      &amp; along the highroad round by the bottom of the grass clad Pike—a
      high-ish hill with a tower on top—skirting the edge of the lake whose
      purple waters were dappled &amp; ridged &amp; scalloped by the wind, &amp; as we
      wandered on beneath the azure canopy with its rose tinged cumulus clouds JWW
      read aloud your "Song for Occupations." Much did I enjoy listening to his valved
      voice speaking your soul-animating words &amp; their precious message.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In the train I read Dr Bucke's little article "Leaves of Grass &amp; Modern
      Science" in the <u>Conservator</u><sup><a href="#loc.02443_n10" id="r20">20</a></sup></p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="loc.02443_n2">3. <em>Man's
         Moral Nature</em> (1879) was Bucke's first book. He dedicated it "to the man
      of all men past and present that I have known who has the most exalted moral
      nature—Walt Whitman."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n6121">7. James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on

      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,

      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n0129">17. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
