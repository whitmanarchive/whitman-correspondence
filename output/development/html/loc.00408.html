      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We hardly know what to think of not hearing from you &nbsp;we certainly expected to have
      a letter from you this morning. Mother is quite anxious and of course fears that something
      has happened to you. Walt write to me at once wont you. I have written you two letters,
      one containing the $10 that Van Anden owed you, and another I mailed you last Sat.
      eve.<sup><a href="#loc.00408_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Mother gave me a letter to mail you on Monday but I forgot it till to-day. You must
      not tell mother about it. We are all well and as jolly as usual. Andrew does not seem
      to get much better. He was at our house to-day to dinner &nbsp;his voice is still so that
      you can hardly here him speak.<sup><a href="#loc.00408_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We had a letter from George yesterday. He was at Mt Sterling Ken.<sup><a href="#loc.00408_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> He seems to feel quite well and satisfied. Mother had a letter from Heyde. He says
      that she must fix up her third story room for Han an him and a lot of stuff. He says
      that Han must come home. He says that Han wants him to take a house and let her take
      a man and wife to board. He wants to know what he shall do with his business. How
      should he get along. All of which I am sure I dont know how Mother can answer him. He is a case. I dont know what to think abt him. Walt I havnt time to write you a long letter, and indeed I havnt anything to write about. I hope to hear from you soon. All send their love, Hattie
      particularly.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00408_n1">1. By the time Jeff's
      letter reached Walt, the poet had already written to acknowledge receipt of the
      letters from  and . Isaac Van Anden, publisher and
      proprietor of the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>. Walt Whitman
      edited this paper (March 1846–January 1848) until he quarreled with Van
      Anden over political issues. For more on Van Anden see Raymond A. Schroth, "The
      <em>Eagle</em> and Brooklyn," in <em>Brooklyn
         USA: The Fourth Largest City in America</em>, ed. Rita Seiden Miller (New
      York: Brooklyn College Press, 1979), 99–119.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00408_n3">3. On April 3, 1863, the
      Ninth Army marched from Paris, Kentucky, to Mount Sterling, Kentucky. For the
      next two weeks the army camped in this area, although on April 15, 1863, it did
      invade Sharpsburg, Kentucky, only to return to Mount Sterling the same day
      (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington
         Whitman</em> [Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1975], 91).<a href="#r3">[back]
