   <p>Seems to me you couldn't do better—(let me suggest, if there is nothing in the
      way &amp; you have no other imperative destination)—than to go on for a week
      or so &amp; see Dr. B[ucke] at London—I know if you do go you will be glad you
      went.<sup><a href="#nyp.00497_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>

   <p id="nyp.00497_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service | Treasury | Washington D C. It is
      postmarked: Philadelphia | Pa. | Sep 6 (?) | 1 30 PM; Washington, Recd. | Sep |
      7 | (?) | 1883 | 2.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00497_n2">2. Whitman's post card was
      written in answer to a letter from O'Connor on September 4 which is not extant
      (see the letter from Whitman to O'Connor of ). Apparently O'Connor planned a vacation in order to recuperate
      after the death of his child. On August 19 Bucke urged O'Connor to visit Canada
      (The Library of Congress, Washington D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
