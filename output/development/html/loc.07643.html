   <p>The sun is out again after three days—good temperature, neither hot nor cold
      to-day—I neither <em>improve</em> nor really go
      back—Keep my room rigidly yet—have had today a bowel
      movement—&amp; sit up most of the time—eat my meals
      sufficiently—<em>take no brain grip</em> (real writing,
      reading, examining proofs) definitely yet, (nor any thing like it plainly as of
      old)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I will very soon send proof pages onward following from "Sands at Seventy"<sup><a href="#loc.07642_n6" id="r2">2</a></sup> for
      proof pieces of ab't 50 pages further—(you have now ab't 40 proof
      pages)—Of course I have for all June <em>stopp'd</em>
      <em>writing the Herald bits</em><sup><a href="#n4160" id="r3">3</a></sup>—&amp; the H. paper ceases by mail wh' is
      just as satisfactory—I have written, formally completed &amp;c. the <em>will document</em> (witnessed by ocular witnesses as this state
      statute requires)<sup><a href="#loc.07643_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> and the designation of my copyrights to be supervised by you,
      Harned<sup><a href="#n4146" id="r5">5</a></sup> and Horace Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r6">6</a></sup>—&amp; now when "Nov. Boughs"<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r7">7</a></sup> are completed—all

   <p><em>Sunday</em>

   <p>Feeling miserably to-day so far—am sitting up—not rain but cloudy and
      cool and raw—bad feeling in belly and head regions, all day so far—had
      the preluded coca-wine, &amp; then my breakfast, moderate—pretty good
      spirits—Mrs Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r8">8</a></sup> has been up ten minutes, good company, good gossip—a
      pretty rose-bouquet from Agnes Traubel<sup><a href="#n4169" id="r9">9</a></sup>—Tom Harned ret'd last evn'g from NY
      three days (likes NY much)—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07642_n6">2. "Sands at Seventy" is a
      group of poems Whitman first published in <em>November
         Boughs</em>, then added as an "annex" to <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4160">3. Whitman contributed a series of
      poems and prose pieces to the <em>New York Herald</em> at the
      invitation of the editor, James Gordon Bennett, Jr. From December 1887 through
      August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems were published in the paper.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.07643_n2">4. The witnesses were Mary
      O. Davis (see note 8) and Dr. Nathan M. Baker, who was serving at the time as
      Whitman's nurse.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4146">5. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel (1856–1914), was
      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on his relationship with Whitman, see
      Thomas Biggs Harned, <em>Memoirs of Thomas B. Harned, Walt
         Whitman's Friend and Literary Executor</em>, ed. Peter Van Egmond (Hartford:
      Transcendental Books, 1972).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">6. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
