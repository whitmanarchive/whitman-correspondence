      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother Walter
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received a letter from you last night and an order for my annual christmas present
      and I do think you are a dear good brother to remember me so often I thank you ever
      and ever so much and hope you are feeling better this winter but am afraid you are
      not as you did not say any thing about it in your letter
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am not feeling well at all this winter not sick abed but a pain in my side all the
      time but I suppose we must expect
      
      
      
      pains and aches as we are growing old but I am thankful I am no worse can get around
      and do my work Ansel is well has been out of work for two months but we get along
      very well I would like to see you very much and still think you will come this way
      some day. I am ashamed of myself for not writing to you oftener but I have got so
      out of the way of writing it seems a job to get at it. I receive papers and books
      quite often from you and am glad to get them I got a picture from you a while ago
      and as you did not say whose it was 
      
      
      I did not know but suppose it was one of Jeffs daughters I also received hannah's
      but I should not have known her either if her name had not been on it
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I do not suppose I should ever know any thing about the family if it was not for you
      as I never get a letter from any of them but I often think of them all and dear mother
      every day
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Again I say thank you and hope we shall both live to see each other once more</p>
