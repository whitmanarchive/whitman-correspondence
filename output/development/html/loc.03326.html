      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Thanks for note forwarded.—reached me this morning! Here in Boston I have had
      some queer ups-&amp;-downs. The notorious blizzard ruined one lecture completely,
      but since then two have passed off with good success, &amp; I am  safe from
      bankruptcy,—glad to be able to get off with a whole skin to England &amp;
      home. I think of leaving here for New York next Monday or Tuesday, &amp; then taking
      a trip to Washington, returning via. Philadelphia for a last visit of two or three
      days. Spring is probably more forward with you, than up here; I hope the brighter
      weather is giving you good cheer,—after  the long imprisonment of
      winter.
   </p>
   
   <p>Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r3">3</a></sup> has not crossed my sight very recently; I hope to spend
      an evening with him before I leave. He went with me the other day to see the
      collection of Jean François Millet's<sup><a href="#n4256" id="r4">4</a></sup> paintings at Mr. Quincey
      Shaw's, Brookline.<sup><a href="#n4139" id="r5">5</a></sup> A grand array they make,— giving one new insight into the
      human environment of earth &amp; sky &amp; water. How paltry this life of  parlours &amp;
      carpets in comparison!
   </p>
   
   <p>The note from H. Gilchrist,<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r6">6</a></sup> which you sent on the other day,
      shows him full of work &amp; good spirits. Of course he ends with "Love to Walt" as
      usual. Several other young fellows over there, who have written lately, have also
      sent greetings &amp; love, to which adding my own, I am, as always,
   </p>

      Yours affectionately,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3098">1. The St. Botolph Club, founded in
      1880, was a well-known social club in Boston, named after Botwulf of Thorney,
      the patron saint of Boston, England. The club attracted many luminary figures,
      including Henry Cabot Lodge and John Boyle O'Reilly.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.03326_n1">2. This letter is addressed: to
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle St. | Camden, | New Jersey. It is postmarked: BOSTON.
      MASS | APR 4 | 4–AM |1888.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">3. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4256">4. Jean-François Millet
      (1814–1875) was a French Realist painter and founder of the Barbizon
      School. He is noted for his depictions of peasant farmers.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4139">5. Quincy Adams Shaw (1825–1908)
      was a wealthy Boston Brahmin businessman and art collector. He traveled with his
      cousin, the historian Francis Parkman, to the American West in the 1840s and is
      a key figure in Parkman's The Oregon Trail. He amassed a large collection of
      Millet's paintings, which Whitman saw when he was in Boston in 1881.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">6. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
