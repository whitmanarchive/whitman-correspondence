      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your card and, some days later, the gift of your Complete Works<sup><a href="#n4192" id="r2">2</a></sup>, as well as the
      parcel of pamphlets and papers you sent me, safely reached me here in the
      country where I am spending my summer holidays, and whence I shall return to
      Potsdam in the beginning of August.<sup><a href="#loc.01096_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> Your card alone would have been a great
      treasure; but to receive, out of your own kind hands, that glorious book with
      your personal dedication, your portraits, and those various materials which
      confirm what had always been my impression of your character, is more to me than
      words of gratitude could express. So I will only say: Thank you
      heartily. To think that some words of mine brought a pleased smile upon the lips
      of a great and good man, adds something priceless to the value of my life.
   </p> 
   
   <p>My article was hastily written and, though you do acknowledge my good intentions,
      must seem very inadequate to you. But for years it has been my aim some day to
      write an exhaustive essay worthy, as far as it may be in my power, of your work
      and genius. Now your personal touch, if I may say so, has given me a new
      impulse, and I am resolved to set to work at once. If life and strength lasts,
      this pen of mine shall help to reveal you to the German people.
   </p>
   
   <p>When I wrote that paper for the "Deutsche Presse," I did not know of the
      translation published at Zürich, of which you speak. But I got it since then and
      brought it here with me. I came here, together with a medical man, Dr. Rehfeldt,<sup><a href="#loc.01096_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> my faithful
      friend since our common school days, and we are staying in a retired spot which
      belongs to the most picturesque in Northern Germany. The house is situated high
      in a garden from which we overlook two deep, quiet lakes, surrounded by hills
      clad with beach and pine forests. On our island between them clusters the hamlet
      of Lagow, at the foot of an ancient castle. My friend has his wife and children
      with him. Every evening when these my little favourites have gone to sleep, we
      light the lamp under an old lime tree in the garden, and then we call you to
      keep us company. The other night I translated to my friends pp. 5 to 11 from Mr.
      O'Connor's<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r5">5</a></sup> "Vindication", and they were deeply moved.
      The wife whose spiritual beauty would gladden your heart, instructed me to send you her love.
      Generally my friend reads the translation while I compare the English text. So
      Messrs. Knortz<sup><a href="#uva.00476_n1" id="r6">6</a></sup> and Rolleston<sup><a href="#n1027" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      have found in us a rather critical public. In many places the rendering is
      excellent, and faithfully mirrors the beauty and power of your thoughts,
      eliciting warm praise from Rehfeldt and his lady. In not a few instances, however,
      we also
      noticed mistakes which sometimes will make it hard to grasp your meaning, for
      those who cannot read the original. No doubt you are aware that it is very
      difficult to translate you; frequently the entire originality of your language
      seems to defy its being moulded into different forms. I have often experienced
      it in my own attempts at translating you; for I was never quite satisfied with
      the result. In any case there is not, in the German translation, that grand
      harmony by which the original is distinguished, and it
      certainly does not reach the perfection of those examples Freiligrath<sup><a href="#n0248" id="r8">8</a></sup> has given us of your work. But to translate a poet, another
      poet is required, and I think that some day he will appear who will do justice
      to you even in German. However, everything considered, it is a careful and
      diligent book Messrs. Knortz and Rolleston have given us, and as pioneering work
      it is most welcome.
   </p>
   
   <p>To avoid mistakes, I think I ought to tell you that I am living as an independant
      literary man, and am not constantly the editor of the "Deutsche Presse," but was
      so only temporarily, because of a severe illness of the regular editor. However,
      since last autumn I am entrusted with the honorary office of first secretary in
      the Society of German authors, a position the duties of which keep me very busy
      indeed. I am also a member of the "Verein Berliner Presse," and though quietly living at
      Potsdam, I have to go to Berlin about twice or three times every week.
   </p>
   
   <p>Perhaps you did not know of the passages characterizing your mind and work which,
      in my article, I have translated from "Thyrza."<sup><a href="#loc.01096_n4" id="r9">9</a></sup> The author of this book, the
      English novelist George Gissing, is one of my very best friends. I knew him from
      my first coming to England, in 1878, and passed with him, in common studies and
      aspirations, some rich and fruitful years of companionship and curious
      Bohemianism, and our correspondence, since my coming back to Germany, was never
      interrupted. I made him acquainted with your works, after my return from
      America, and it is my own experience he has related in "Thyrza": his hero's
      getting to know "Leaves of Grass" during his American life, and coming home a
      new man.
   </p>     
   
   
   <p>I spent two years in America, from 1881 to 1883, at Rugby, Tennessee, the English
      colony of Thomas Hughes.<sup><a href="#loc.01096_n6" id="r10">10</a></sup> My health had broken down from overwork, and making the
      personal acquaintance of the author of "Tom Brown's School Days," I was induced
      to join his settlement, since I urgently needed a change of air. The sea voyage
      did me much good, and when I arrived at Rugby, I was well enough to help for a
      month or two in nursing those English young fellows who, after coming out to
      Tennessee, were most of them attacked by typhoid fever. A number died, and when
      the others recovered I went into the wilderness. But though I acquired a hundred
      acres of forest land, and got a good house erected there in a solitary and
      romantic spot, all of which is still my property, my farming came to nothing, as
      I longed to get back to my studies, as soon as I had got well again in the rough
      and healthy 
      forest life. Seven squatter's children came to me every morning with their
      spelling-books, and I amused myself with teaching them the three R's, still snow
      blocked the roads. Then I passed the winter in complete solitude, reading
      Shakespeare and the ancient classics, with no companion save a fine collie dog I
      had brought over with me from England. In the spring of 1882, the trustees of
      the "Hughes Public Library" which, in honour of Tom Hughes, had been founded at
      Rugby by the publishers of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, offered me the
      post of librarian, and I accepted it for a year, during which time I had to
      arrange and to catalogue the whole library.
   </p> 
   
   <p>Your works were not among the donations; but reading about you in the "Critic"
      paper, I believe, which was regularly sent to the library, I ordered "Leaves of
      Grass" from Cincinnati, and from the very first I recognized your geniune
      greatness, and loved you with all my heart. However, with a whole library at my disposal,
      in which hundreds and hundreds of books were new to me and attracted my
      curiosity, I was not then in a position to enter very deeply into anything, but
      rather tasted of everything, and I may say the seeds that fell into my heart
      when first reading you, have grown to maturity only after my return to Europe
      when I found time quietly to digest what I had hastily swallowed.
   </p>
   
   <p>I did not want to stay in America, as I felt that my real work lay in Europe with
      which I was most strongly connected by personal and intellectual ties. So in
      June, 1883, I went back first to England, and, about a year after that, to
      Germany. But before leaving, I spent a fortnight in New York, and there I
      purchased "Specimen Days and Collect,"<sup><a href="#n4121" id="r11">11</a></sup> so that your complete works, as far as
      they were then published, accompanied me to Europe.
   </p> 
   
   <p>Since then I have been leading the life of a literary man. In
      1884 I wrote an English book, entitled "The French Prisoners",—the story
      of a friendship between a German boy and a young French soldier. It was
      published by Messrs. Macmillan &amp; Co., of London, and rather well received by
      criticism. One of its chapters is headed by a motto from "Leaves of Grass",
      orig.: "Beautiful thought, beautiful as the sky, that war and all its deeds of
      carnage must in time for even be lost."<sup><a href="#loc.01096_n7" id="r12">12</a></sup> In the following year I published, at
      Leipzig, a German translation of Montesquieu's "Lettres persanes,"<sup><a href="#loc.01096_n8" id="r13">13</a></sup> with
      commentary and critical introduction. In the latter I have also mentioned
      you.
   </p> 
   
   <p>But I may say I am still in the beginning of my literary career. After finishing
      that translation, I devoted about three years to extensive studies, writing very
      little, and it seems to me that only then I acquired what I may perhaps regard
      as my maturity. Now during the last year I have written a number
      of long articles on literary matters, for various papers, and I had the
      satisfaction that almost every one of them brought me letters of approval and
      gifts of books from authors. All that is very encouraging and assures me in the
      hope that I may in time do some really good work. Having devoted much industry
      and thought to the study of philosophy, social science, and literature, I was
      able to form an independent opinion on many things; and as my highest aim in
      writing is truth, I have come to believe that there is some important work to do
      for my pen. And I trust you will find it is no unworthy advocate that is going
      to interpret you to the Germans. You will not wonder, of course, if I tell you
      that in many respects I am opposed to the spirit now current in the German
      empire. I am not a fighting man by nature, but as an author I feel in duty bound to
      defend with unflagging energy what is highest in life and literature, and I
      would rather be silent forever than to foster anything mean and unjust.
   </p>  
   
   <p>July 22nd, 1889.</p>
   
   <p>Yesterday your gift of Dr. Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r14">14</a></sup> book arrived, as well as,
      from Mr. Knortz of New York, his German lecture about you. Thank you from all my
      heart for the kind and welcome help you are giving me in the work that is now
      before me: for indeed all those materials will make my task much more easy. But,
      besides being a help, Mr. Bucke's book contains much, very much that is new to
      me and a key to your work and character. And, beyond all that, everything that
      comes from you is sanctified, and words cannot express what it means to me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have written this very long letter because I felt it due to you to tell you
      something of the disciple who was so kindly received by you. Perhaps, as my work
      progresses, it will please you to hear now and then how I am getting on. But of
      course no answer will be needed, since it is quite sufficient to me to imagine
      that my lines come to you like a pleasant visitor.
   </p>
   
   <p>By-the-by, there was a delay in sending you my article, because I did not know in
      what city you are living. After some weeks only, seeing from a paragraph in the
      London "Athenaeum" that you had been present at the celebration of your birthday
      in Camden, New Jersey,<sup><a href="#loc.03027_n4" id="r15">15</a></sup> I concluded that you were dwelling there.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now good-bye for this once, my dear friend and Master. I send you my sincere
      goodwishes for the improvement of your health and strength. Some weeks ago my
      old grandparents, after sixty years marriage, celebrated their diamond wedding.
      My grandfather who last year had been so ill that hardly any hope remained for
      his life, walks now about again and reads all day long, and is as ardent and
      radical a politician as ever, though now past eighty-six: I trust you too, like
      him, will grow quite strong again.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Ever yours reverently, gratefully, and affectionately,
      <br></br>Edward Bertz.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Bertz (1853–1931),
      also spelled "Eduard," was a German writer and translator from Potsdam, who
      became involved with social democracy movements and signed a petition against
      the criminalization of homosexuality in Germany. In honor of Whitman's
      seventieth birthday, Bertz published an article in the <em>Deutsche Presse</em> of June 2, 1889 (Amelia von Ende, "Whitman and the
      Germans of Today," <em>The Conservator</em> No. 4 [June 1907],
      55–57). Bertz sent Whitman the article in his , letter to the poet. A holograph copy of the article, with
      corrections by Whitman (June 1889) is part of the Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection, held by the Library of Congress. Whitman discussed the letter and
      Bertz's article with Horace Traubel, remarking, "It is interesting to me to know
      what they think of us way over there. It comes from Berlin, which is a center, I
      suppose, an important center" (Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.82.html">Friday, June 28, 1889</a>). For more information on Bertz, see

   <p id="uva.00476_n1">6. Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For

   <p id="n1027">7. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.

   <p id="n0248">8. Ferdinand Freiligrath (1810–1876) was a German
      poet and translator and friend of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In his  letter to Rudolf Schmidt, Whitman
      wrote that Freiligrath "translates &amp; commends my poems." His review in the
      Augsburg <em>Allgemeinen Zeitung</em> on April 24, 1868 (reprinted
      in his <em>Gesammelte Dichtungen</em> [Stuttgart: G. J. Göschen,
      1871], 4:86–89), was among the first notices of Whitman's poetry on the
      continent. A translation of the article appeared in the <em>New
         Eclectic Magazine</em>, 2 (July 1868), 325–329; see also Gay Wilson
      Allen, <em>Walt Whitman Abroad</em> (Syracuse: Syracuse University
      Press, 1955), 3–7. A digital version is available in Walter Grünzweig's
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/german/introduction.html">Whitman in the German-Speaking Countries</a>," which collects several
      examples of German reception of Whitman's poetry. Freiligrath had promised his
      readers "some translated specimens of the poet's productions," not a complete
      translation. William D. O'Connor and Whitman were applying pressure. A
      sympathetic article on Whitman in the New York <em>Sontagsblatt</em> of November 1, 1868, mentioned Freiligrath's admiration
      for the American poet. A translation of this article, which Whitman had a
      Washington friend prepare, is now in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.<a href="#r8">[back]

      Philadelphia firm of Rees Welsh and Company in 1882. The second issue was
      published by David McKay. Many of the autobiographical notes, sketches, and
      essays that focus on the poet's life during and beyond the Civil War had been

         War</em> (1875–1876).

   <p id="n0119">14. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
      the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry

      dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
      addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
      arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks.<a href="#r15">[back]
