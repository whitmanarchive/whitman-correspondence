      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am again intending to cross the Atlantic.<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r1">1</a></sup> I think it is in some way necessary for me that I should see things from your side
      of the water—from the point of view of solution from old world ties (they are tight
      enough here!)—at any rate I am continually impelled to make this voyage.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But I should not write to you on that account, except that seeing you goes along with—is,
      in some sense, the main part of it all. Now I am not going to love you—I know well
      enough what boredom is—nor do I come as a <u>curious</u>, as you well know if you read the enclosed—but I think there are reasons <u>why we should <u>meet</u></u>.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Now what I want you to do is—I do not want you to say Yes, but I want you to say No—if
      No is the word. For I feel that you may be unwell—altogether unable or unwilling to
      see strangers—then if it is so, just the one bit of kindness you can do for me is
      to say it (on a postcard). Will you do that?—and as soon as possible.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am able to get away from my work towards the middle of April, and it would be then
      that I should undertake this journey—having probably
      
      to return to England by the end of May.
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>I enclose 2 or 3 specimens of much that I have been writing in spare hours of late—social
      complications coming into the subjects of many of them: but I shall not publish them
      just yet.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>What must be done—and what you have largely (for a foundation <u>entirely</u>) done—is to form a new organic centre for the thought growth of this age. All seems
      clear to me at times, so simple, so luminously clear—I have no more doubt or trouble
      for myself—but then to <u>express</u> it: that is an
      
      endless business—a thing never finished.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My usual address is 45 Brunswick Square, Brighton.</p>
   
   
   <p>Please however, if you write now, address to York as above.</p>
   
   
   <p>Your two volumes with my name written in them are my faithful companions.</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0141b">1. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
