   <p>Y'r letter has come this forenoon—finds me quite sick &amp; lying down most of the time—Will
      write soon &amp; more at length—I have these spells sometimes &amp; then have to let every
      thing go. Nothing serious—shall be all right in a few days—Keep a stout heart, dear
      boy, &amp; God bless you—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.
