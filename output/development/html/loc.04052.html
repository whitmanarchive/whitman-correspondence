      <br></br><br></br>My Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I feel as if I didn't a bit deserve the glorious budget you sent me yesterday, for
      I have been a laggard, dull correspondent of late, because, leading such an unsettled
      kind of life, I don't seem to have got well hold of myself. Beautiful is the title
      prose poem—the glimpse of the autumn cornfield: one smells the sweet fragrance, basks
      in the sunshine with you—tastes all the varied, subtle outdoor pleasures, just as
      you want us to. A lady who has just been calling on me—Miss Hillard—no relation of
      the odious Dr. H.—said, "Have you seen a lovely little bit about a cornfield by Walt
      Whitman in a New York paper?" She did not know your poems, but was so taken with this.
      By the bye, I am not quite American enough yet to enjoy the sound of the locusts &amp;
      big grasshoppers—ours are modest little things that only make a gentle sort of whirr—not
      that loud brassy sound—couldn't help wishing for more birds &amp; less insects when I
      was at Chesterfield<sup><a href="#n1500" id="r1">1</a></sup>—but I like our English name "ladybird" better than "ladybug". Do your children always
      say when they see one, as ours do, "Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home: your house
      is on fire, your children are flown"? But for the rest—I believe I am growing a very
      good American; indeed, certain am I there is no more lovable people to live amongst
      anywhere in the world—and in this respect it has been good to give up having a home
      of my own here for awhile—for I have been thrown amongst many more intimately than
      I could have been otherwise. What you say of Herby's picture delights me, dear Friend.
      I have been grieving he was not with us, sharing the pleasant times we have had and
      enlarging his circle of friends—but after all he could not have been doing better—he
      must come on here by &amp; bye. I wonder if you are as satisfied with his portrait of
      you as with the landscape. I suppose he is gone on to New York to-day. I have sighed
      for dear little Concord many times since I came away—beautiful city as Boston is &amp;
      many the interesting &amp; kindly people I am seeing here: but the outdoor life &amp; the
      entirely simple, unpretending, cordial, friendly ways of Concord &amp; its inhabitants
      won my heart altogether—one of them came to see me to-day &amp; to ask us to go and spend
      a couple of days with them there again before we leave &amp; I could not say nay, though
      our time is short. There are some portraits in the Art Museum here, which interested
      me a good deal—of Adams, Hancock, Quincy, &amp;c.,—&amp; of some of the women of that time—they
      would form an excellent nucleus of a national portrait gallery, which (together with
      good biographies while yet materials &amp; recollections are fresh &amp; abundant) would be
      a very interesting &amp; important contribution to the world's history.—Tennyson's letter
      is a pleasure to me to see—considering his age &amp; the imperfection of his sight through
      life, matters are better rather than worse with him than one could have expected.
      Since that was written a friend (Walter White)<sup><a href="#n1501" id="r2">2</a></sup> tells me they—the Tennysons—have taken a house in Eaton Sq., London, for the winter.
      And last, not least, thanks for Mr. Burroughs's beautiful letter—that young man is
      indeed, as he says, like a bit out of your poems.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There are two or three fine young men boarding here, &amp; Giddy &amp; I enjoy their society
      not a little. Love to your Brothers &amp; Sister. I shall write soon as I am settled down
      in New York to her or Hattie. Love to Mrs. Stafford. And most of all to you.
   </p>

      Good-bye, dear friend.

   <p>I will send T's letter in a day or two.</p>
