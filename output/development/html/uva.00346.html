      <br></br><br></br>Dear comrade
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been improving for the last two days, &amp; think I shall be up &amp; around soon,
      as well as ever—I have had the services of a good physician, who has allowed me to
      get well quite naturally—he decided that the only thing needing serious watching was
      the throat, &amp; had prepared if the disease there went beyond a certain point to call
      in a skilful New York doctor, for consultation, but fortunately we were saved the
      trouble—I felt a good deal like myself the most of yesterday, &amp; the same to-day—so
      I don't think I am hurrahing before I am out of the woods.
   </p>
   
   <p>We have a letter from my brother George, down to 18th inst. he was all safe.<sup><a href="#uva.00346_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> My mother &amp; folks are all well—
   </p>
   
   <p>I rece'd the letter enveloped to me 25th—I sent a line to Wm O'Connor, 25th, which I suppose
      he rec'd—has Nelly gone yet? I shall write to her next time—remember me to Ashton<sup><a href="#uva.00346_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> with friendship—also to Arnold Johnson<sup><a href="#uva.00346_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> with sincere thanks &amp; tell him I am getting well—&amp; give my best respects &amp; thanks
      to Major Hapgood.

      additional engagements of his regiment, and was confident that "it will not be
      long before the long covetted City of Petersburg will be in our possession. I
      notice by the papers that our Corps is very little spoken of, but for all that
      they have done some splendid fighting, although we seem to be rather outsiders
      here in the Army of the Potomac."<a href="#r2">[back]
