      <br></br><br></br>My dear Conway:<sup xmlns=""><a href="#nyp.00272_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr. Whitman has shown me your letter of October 12, with news of Mr. Hotten's
      proposed London print of Leaves of Grass or selection therfrom, edited by Mr.
      Rosetti, with an Introductory Essay or preface, by Mr. R.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now, in view of the latter, if I may take the liberty, I wish to speak of two or
      three points, or rather, enforce them—for no doubt they will, to a certain
      extent, have occurred to Mr. Rosetti. But as I have made Leaves of Grass &amp; their
      author my study for the last seven years, &amp; have had some fortuitous advantages,
      perhaps Mr. Rosetti would not consider it intrusive in me, that I send this letter,
      which I wish you to hand him.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Considering the attitude of the public, and their average calibre, and also
      considering the general bearing of most of the criticisms on Mr. Whitman's poetry,
      I
      would suggest the expediency, in any forthcoming, friendly examination of his genius
      &amp; writings, of dwelling pretty strongly on the following points, &amp; making
      them unmistakably appear: <br><br>
      <span>1st—That personally the author of Leaves of Grass is in no sense or
         sort whatever the "rough," the "eccentric," "vagabond" or queer person, that
         the commentators, (always bound for the intensest possible sensational
         statement,) persist in making him. He has moved, &amp; moves still, along
         the path of his life's happenings &amp; fortunes, as they befall or have
         befallen him, with entire serenity &amp; decorum, never defiant even to the
         conventions, always bodily sweet &amp; fresh, dressed plainly &amp; cleanly,
         a gait &amp; demeanor of antique simplicity, cheerful &amp; smiling,
         performing carefully all his domestic, social, &amp; municipal obligations,
         his demonstrative nature toned very low, but eloquent enough of eye,
         posture, &amp; expression, though using only moderate words; and offering to
         the world, in himself, an American Personality, &amp; real Democratic
         Presence, that not only the best old Hindu, Greek, and Roman worthies would
         at once have responded to, but which the most cultured European, from court
         or academy, would likewise, on meeting to-day, see &amp; own without demur.
         All really refined persons, and the women more than the men, take to Walt
         Whitman. The most delicate &amp; even conventional lady only needs to know
         him to love him.<sup><a href="#nyp.00272_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup>
         </span><br>
      
      <span>2.<sup><a href="#nyp.00272_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup> Critically, a significant, if not the most
         significant, fact about Leaves of Grass, is, that the genesis &amp;
         fashioning of them have evidently not been for literary purposes, merely or
         mainly. Neither in mass nor detail have their pages been tried by the <em>sine qua non</em> of current literary or esthetic
         standards. Instead of that, the Book is the product of the largest universal
         law &amp; play of things, &amp; of that sense of kosmical beauty, of which
         even literature is but a fraction. This is probably the clue to the
         explanation of the puzzle of the widely-vexatious formal &amp; esthetic
         argument involved in Leaves of Grass.</span><br>
      
      <span>3. The idea, however, which is this man's highest contribution, and which,
         compared even with the vastness of Biblical &amp; Homeric poetry, still
         looms &amp; towers—as, athwart his fellow-giants of the Himalayas, the
         dim head of Kunchainjunga rises over the rest—is the idea of Totality,
         of the All-successful, final certainties of each individual man, as well as
         of the world he inhabits. Joyousness, out of such sure ultimate happiness
         &amp; triumph, rings throughout his verse. He holds the solution of each
         &amp; every problem—the spell, giving full satisfaction; and his
         talisman is <em>Ensemble</em>. This is the word that
         epitomises the philosophy of Walt Whitman. Add the word <em>modernness</em>, &amp; you begin to unlock Leaves of Grass.<sup><a href="#nyp.00272_n6" id="r4">4</a></sup></span><br>
      <br></p>
   
   <p>These are the points, my dear Conway, that I wish, through you, to submit to Mr.
      Rosetti. I have mentioned to Mr. Whitman my intention of writing him, &amp; he, W.,
      has made no objection. I would add, for myself, for Mr. Rosetti, that I hope he will
      not be deterred from giving fullest swing to what I am sure I have discovered in
      him, namely, an intuitional admiration &amp; appreciation of our Poet, by the
      ostensibly timid attitude held at present by the critical &amp; reading world toward
      Leaves of Grass—but hope he will strike at that loftier, honestly enthusiastic
      range of minds &amp; readers, which, perhaps by the time Mr. Hotten's volume gets
      well in the hands of the public, will prove the genuine audience Mr. Whitman is
      certain of.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Again asking pardon of Mr. Rosetti for perhaps intruding these suggestions—yet
      placing them in any &amp; every respect at his service should they be so fortunate
      as to strike him favorably—I remain &amp;c &amp;c

      Address: "M. D. Conway, | 14 Milborne Grove, | Brompton W. | London, |
      England."<br><br>
      This draft letter was prepared by Walt Whitman for William D. O'Connor to
      copy and send to Conway, who was Walt Whitman's agent for the forthcoming
      English edition; see Whitman's letters of  and  to Moncure
      D. Conway. In 1888 Whitman did not remember whether O'Connor "had used it or
      not." "I must," he said to Horace Traubel, "have been intending to assist
      him in something he was to say to Conway. If he used it at all he probably
      recast it in his own manner" (<em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.89.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996],
      1:381–382). The probabilities are that O'Connor sent it without
      substantial alteration. William Michael Rossetti noted in his diary, on
      November 28, 1867, that O'Connor "has written another letter (not yet in
      Conway's hands) setting forth the points he would wish insisted on in any
      prefatory work of mine. I replied to him in cordial terms, but to the effect
      that the Preface and part of the Selection are now in print, and cannot well
      be remodelled" (<em>Rossetti Papers</em> [London: Sands &amp;
      Co, 1903], 244). <br><br>
      A draft of this letter in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.,
      includes two notations, written at different times: "Part of Wm O'Connor's |
      letter to Conway. | Nov. 10, 1867. . . . Good for | use in | review of
      Leaves | of Grass." <br><br>
      That Whitman took pains in composing the letter is evidenced by the many
      changes he made in the draft which he retained and which Horace Traubel
      printed. He observed to Traubel: "It gives my idea of my own book: a man's
      idea of his own book—his serious idea—is not to be despised. I
      do not lack in egotism, as you know—the sort of egotism that is
      willing to know itself as honestly as it is willing to know third or fourth
      parties" (<em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.90.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996], 1:83).

   <p id="nyp.00272_n4">2. This paragraph does not
      appear in Walt Whitman's first draft. However, toward the end of that version
      appears this simple statement—"Personally the author is a man of normal
      characteristics, &amp; of moderate, healthy, following a regular employment,
      averse to any display" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.; Horace Traubel,
      <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.90.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996],
      1:384).<a href="#r2">[back]

      at this point.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00272_n6">4. In criticizing Conway's
      article in the <em>Fortnightly Review</em>, O'Connor wrote on
      December 5, 1866: "The great, paramount, unmistakable thing about 'Leaves of
      Grass' is its modernness" (Yale). In <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, As
         Poet and Person</em> (New York: American News Company, 1867), Burroughs
      wrote: "As we gaze and gaze, and wish the unlocking word, gradually the dimness
      and the many-tinted, many-twining lines become illumined, definite, showing
      clearly the word—MODERNNESS" (36). For Walt Whitman's critique of Conway
      see his  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
