   <p>It is 4 P.M. I am writing in my office. I can just see to write without the gas and
      that is all. It is warm and has rained all day (raining hard now). This is the
      funniest winter yet. La Grippe is having a lively time here. Knocking the folk over
      right and left (but they soon get up again). Nearly every one at my house is more
      or
      less sick—some of them pretty bad (but nothing dangerous so far). Two of the
      D<u>rs</u> at the Asylum are doubled up in bed. Beemer<sup><a href="#loc.07330_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; I
      keep around yet. Quite a number of attendants &amp;c (no patients, so far) sick. If
      the disease increases it may cripple us pretty badly for a short time. Willy
      Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r3">3</a></sup> has been very sick for 3 days, a little better
      today

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07330_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey U.S.A. It is postmarked:

   <p id="loc.07330_n2">2. Dr. Beemer was in charge of
      the "Refractory Building" at Bucke's asylum. Whitman met Beemer during his visit
      there in the summer of 1880. See James H. Coyne, <em>Richard
         Maurice Bucke: A Sketch</em> (Toronto: Transactions of the Royal Society of
      Canada, 1906), 52.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4284">3. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
