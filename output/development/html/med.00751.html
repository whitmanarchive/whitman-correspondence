   </p>
   
   <p>I have been somewhat <em>down</em> for days, even weeks past, but am
      better now—have been out a little to-day, driven in the phaeton. Come over
      very soon &amp; see me. Nothing particular, but it will cheer me up. Bring anybody
      you like with you.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Talcott Williams
      (1849–1928) was associated with the New York <em>Sun</em>
      and <em>World</em> as well as the Springfield <em>Republican</em> before he became the editor of the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in 1879. His newspaper vigorously defended Whitman
      in news articles and editorials after the Boston censorship of 1882. For more
      information about Williams, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_108.html">Williams, Talcott (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00751_n1">1. The Philadelphia <em>Press</em> dutifully printed the following on February 1:
      "Yesterday was Walt Whitman's best day for a long time. He went out
      phæton-riding in the mid-day sun and enjoyed it. Yesterday, too, he
      received a warm letter from Alfred Tennyson commencing 'Dear Old Man.' Life
      continues tenacious and cheery with Whitman, but he is very feeble." <em>The Press</em> is referring to the letter from Tennyson to
      Whitman of .<a href="#r1">[back]
