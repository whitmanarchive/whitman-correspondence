      <br></br>400 L Street.  
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Did you arrive home safely, dear Walt? and did you vote?
      did you vote seven time "as the Count did when he first become a citizen of these
      United
      States?<sup><a href="#loc.00940_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> If not in your own person, I hope that you caused
      as many as seven raving Democrats to vote right this time, however as the result was
      all
      right we argue that you did your part.
   </p>
   
   <p>Now, now, Walt, are you aware that your "ten days" expire to-morrow? Not that I at
      all
      expect to see you then for ten days would be a short time to stay at home after nearly
      a
      year's absence,—but we have 
      been counting the days
      in the <u>very faintest</u> hope that you might come then.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr. Eldridge comes as usual every evening, and we always ask each other—"have you
      heard
      from Walt?"<sup><a href="#loc.00940_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> He has sent you two letters, one the next day
      after you left, and one since. We have drank your health on several occasions, and
      in a
      variety of liquids, <u>tea</u> on one occasion.
   </p>
   
   <p>By the way, all of the Piatts including the sweet Patsy &amp; the baby have dined with
      us since you left.<sup><a href="#loc.00940_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> I shall save all details to tell you when
      you come. But you were asked for, and we all wished you present.Of course Mr. Eldridge &amp; Mrs. Cooper
      formed two of the dinner party.<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> Mrs. C. is still with me,
      being detained much longer than she expected to be, for which I am very glad. I shall
      not know how to get along without her, especially while you are gone. She is very
      bright
      and keeps us alive, she knows how to cook nice things too, and has exercised her genius
      for me several times, and if you will come back before she is gone, we will have a
      nice
      dinner for you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I fully intended to be able to tell you something about your boys in hospital, but
      I
      have had so bad a cold since you left and such an annoying troublesome cough
      with it, that I have not been able to go to see them. They must miss you sadly, poor
      boys, I pity them.
   </p>
   
   <p>How did you find all at home? Did your good mother look as when you left her? &amp; did
      you remember to give her my love? how did little Hattie look? had she grown much?
      &amp;
      what do you think of the <u>new</u> baby? did you kiss them both for me?
      If not you must.
   </p>
   
   <p>How about all the other members of the family? I hope you found all better than you
      expected. You know I feel personally acquainted with each member of your family.
   </p>
   
   <p>And what about your New York boys? Of course you have seen all, and have had that
      great
      <u>time</u> which we are to hear all about when you come back.
      Indeed, won't you have "lots" to tell us! You know you must come back prepared to
      give
      us a full account.
   </p>
   
   <p>Have you seen Mrs. Price.<sup><a href="#loc.00940_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> I wrote her the very day you left.
      Do you find her much worse than when you left last year?
   </p>
   
   <p>And Walt, have you seen Mr. Howells?<sup><a href="#loc.00940_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup> If not I beg that you
      will, and with all the skill and talent of which you are master do what you can to disenchant
      him with those people. I know more about it than when you were here, and I assure
      you
      that you will be rendering a service not only to Mrs. H. &amp; the family, but to all
      who care for him if you can only get him out of this. If he could but know the real
      truth in regard to "the great head" and leader of the reform it would surely open
      his
      eyes. He evidently thinks Mr. A. a "great light" &amp; a saint of a man, sincere and
      true. Oh! can't he be enlightened? It is awful, and unless his eyes are soon opened
      I
      don't see what will be the end. I depend on youWalt, to see him, at any rate, &amp; your
      own intuition will tell you whether you can do more, but I feel that you can. He has
      great regard for your opinions of people and things.
   </p>
   
   <p>William is well as usual, he is at the office or would send lots of love.<sup><a href="#loc.00940_n8" id="r7">7</a></sup> Mrs. Cooper has gone in to the other house to dress for
      dinner, or she too, would send love. Do you know that in the innocence of her heart
      she
      fully believes that you are going to stop and see her on your return through
      Philadelphia, and <u>I</u> have not the heart to undeceive her, and tell
      her what a <u>promising</u> youth you are so I don't see but that you really must
      make the promised visit,—&amp; you would have a very good time, I assure you of that
      beforehand. She wants me to go home with her, but I doubt if I shall. Can't afford
      it.
   </p>
   
   <p>By the way, one bit of intelligence in regard to our dear friend and neighbor Gwynne
      I
      must tell you.<sup><a href="#loc.00940_n9" id="r8">8</a></sup> They think of moving &amp; renting the house
      up here, &amp; a lady whom I know came to look at it. G. was much pleased at the idea
      of
      having such a nice family as hers for tenants, &amp; offered to rent it for one hundred dollars a month unfurnished.
      The lady politely declined &amp; told him that she rents her present house <u>furnished</u> for that sum. Mrs. G. &amp; the new baby are well. I
      can't think of any more news to tell you.
   </p>
   
   <p>To tell you that we miss you <u>awfully</u> would not be news would it?
      You expected that, but I do have a most uncomfortable sense of "goneness" all the
      time,
      &amp; I shall welcome you home here <u>very heartily</u>.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Can I do any thing for you in your absence?</p>
   
   <p>Don't forget the three things you were to bring for <u>my</u> especial benefit. The picture, letter, &amp; "Drum
      Taps"—
   </p>
   
   <p>Now good bye—and very much love from us all. I have said nothing of Jeannie, she is
      not as well as I want to see her looking, she is out playing, or I would ask her what
      message to you. She asks for you often, and hopes you will soon be back.

   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Do write <u>very soon</u>, &amp; direct to Corner of 14th &amp; L

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years, and he speaks often in his letters of their daughter Jean, by nickname
      "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break in late
      1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated black citizens,
      Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence between Whitman and
      Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For
      more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see also Dashae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00940_n2">1. Count Adam Gurowski
      (1805–1866), a Polish exile, published an eccentric three-volume Diary
      (1862–1866), a day-by-day account of the war written with a marked
      partiality toward extreme abolitionists. The Count was a colorful figure: he
      covered his lost eye with a "green blinder," and "he had a Roman head...a
      powerful topknot, in and out: people always stopped to look at him" (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York, Rowman
      and Littlefield, 1961], 3:79, 96). William D. O'Connor, who apparently
      translated Gurowski's manuscripts into English (see the letter from Gurowski to
      O'Connor in Feinberg), reported to Whitman on , that "he is a madman with lucid intervals"—he had
      attempted "to discipline the firemen with a
      pistol."
      Whitman maintained to Traubel in 1888 that "he was truly a remarkable, almost
      phenomenal, man," and that "he was, no doubt, very crazy, but also very sane"
      (3:79, 340). Ellen O'Connor related in a letter on , that the Count had said to her recently: "My Gott,
      I did not know that [Walt Whitman] was such a poet, tell him so, I have been
      trying every where to find him to tell him myself." In the last volume of the
      Diary, Gurowski placed Whitman's name in the first category of his threefold
      evaluation of persons "mentioned in this volume": "Praise," "Half and Half," and
      "Blame." In his entry for April 18, 1864, the Count referred to Whitman as among
      "the most original and genuine American hearts and minds" (187). In a footnote
      (372–373), appended September 12, 1865, Gurowski abused Harlan, who had
      "shown himself to be animated by a spirit of narrow-minded persecution that
      would honor the most fierce Spanish or Roman inquisitor." Gurowski was praised
      by Robert Penn Warren, in Malcolm Cowley, ed., <em>Writers at
         Work: The "Paris Review" Interviews</em>, (New York: Viking, 1958), 189. See
      also LeRoy Fischer, <em>Mississippi Valley Historical Review</em>,
      36 (1949–1950): 415–434, and the <em>Dictionary of
         American Biography, Supplement One</em> (New York: Scribner, 1944).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00940_n3">2. In December 1862, on his
      way to visit his brother George at Fredericksburg, Virginia, Whitman stopped in
      Washington and encountered Charles W. Eldridge, who was now a clerk in the
      office of the army paymaster. After he had seen for himself that George had not
      been severely wounded, he returned to Washington, which was to be his home until
      1873. Eldridge obtained a desk for Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood,
      the army paymaster.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00940_n4">3. John J. Piatt met Whitman
      on New Year's Day, 1863. Piatt was a versifier and author of <em>Poems by Two Friends</em> in collaboration with W. D. Howells; see Clara
      Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs: Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin, 1931), 43. On February 12, 1866, he wrote a sympathetic account of
      Whitman and <em>The Good Gray Poet</em> for the Columbus (Ohio)
      <em>Morning Journal</em>; see <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs: Comrades</em>, 10, and William Sloane Kennedy, <em>The Fight of a Book for the World</em> (West Yarmouth, Massachusetts: The
      Stonecraft Press, 1926), 17. The Washington Directory of 1866 listed Piatt as a
      clerk in the Treasury Department; according to <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs: Comrades</em>, 12, he was later librarian of the House of
      Representatives and then consul at Cork.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00185_n2">4. The identity of Mrs. Cooper
      is unclear. A Mrs. Cooper is mentioned in Whitman's notation on Ellen O'Connor's
      letter of , and on , O'Connor informed Whitman that
      Eldridge was going to stay at Mrs. Cooper's home in Philadelphia for several
      days. This is undoubtedly the Hattie B. Cooper (listed in the Directory as C. H.
      B. Cooper, "gentlewoman") who in an undated letter sent a "Christmas Greeting"
      to Whitman. Fred Vaughan referred to who is likely a different Mrs. Cooper on
      ; the Mrs. Cooper of Vaughan's
      letters was the mother of his roommate Robert "Bob" Cooper after Vaughan left
      Whitman's Classon Avenue apartment.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00940_n6">5. Abby H. Price
      (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
      husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
      children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
      age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
      were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
      Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for
      the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother in <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 (1908): 163–169. In a letter to Ellen M.
      O'Connor from , Whitman declared

      according to entries in New York Directories, must have been versatile (and
      perhaps eccentric): in 1864–1865 he was an "inventor," in 1865–1866
