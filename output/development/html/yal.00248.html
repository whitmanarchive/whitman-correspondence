   </p>
   
   
   <p>Supposing you may receive this Monday morning, I feel to say to you &amp; Mrs. J. &amp; all
      the childer too, <em>Happy 
         new year, for the first thing</em>—&amp; you take this home to Mrs. J to read the printed letter on the other 
      side—(it is one I sent to Rossetti in London, &amp; he had some copies printed as a sort
      of circular)—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>vThe watch came last evening, &amp; I received and examined it this forenoon—I think it is going
      to do 
      just right—thanks—very cold here, the gale whistling &amp; blowing about the house, as
      I write—but 
      the sun shining bright enough. Note in the box rec'd &amp; welcomed—I am feeling quite
      well for me—If 
      you see J Miller tell him <em>I like much</em> his piece to me in the January Galaxy—it is full of the fieriest horses, held well in hand—tell him to write to me—I shall
      send you 
      a newspaper to-morrow with some little poems to me extracted, Miller's among them—When
      you read it 
      &amp; are through, give it to J M—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
