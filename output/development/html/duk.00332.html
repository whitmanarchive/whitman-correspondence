      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>All is quiet along the Rappahannock and we are still lying here in Camp. The weather
      has been Cold here, for the last day or two, and this morning the ground is covered
      with snow, but the sun is out now, warm and pleasant and promises fine weather. We
      were paid, a few days since, and one of our Officers leaves this afternoon for Washington
      to take money to the Express Office. I shall send you $300. The Expressage will not
      be paid so you will pay it when you receive the money. I suppose you will get it soon
      after you get this.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been out with my Co on Picket but we are now back to Camp, &nbsp;I had charge of
      the line, for more than a mile, so that I had to keep my Eyes open, &nbsp;we were posted along the bank of the river which is very narrow, and so Shallow that
      it is very easy to cross, at some places, &nbsp;The Rebs are posted on the opposite bank
      in plain sight and we could talk to each other, but there was no shooting as I had
      strickt orders not to alow a rifle fired, unless the Rebs commenced the performance, &nbsp;Capt Francis,<sup><a href="#duk.00332_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> came back last night but he is not very well and will not take command of the Co
      for a few days yet. I received Walts letter, (enclosing a note from You and Mattie)
      when I was on Picket, and was so pleased to hear from you all, that I read them over
      three or four times, and wished we could have one good big square fight that would
      settle the Rebs, and the war at the same time, so that I could come home and see you
      all, and drink that wine <em>Matt has</em> saved for me.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hardly think there will be a fight here at Fredericksburg, as we have orders to fix up our tents as though we were expected
      to stay here some time.
   </p>
   
   <p>The rebels seem to be buisy, building breastworks, and prepareing for us, but I should think it would not be much trouble for us to drive them out
      of Fredericksburg if we went about it. I see by the papers the great Banks Expedition<sup><a href="#duk.00332_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> has sailed, but everyone is in the dark as to its destination, &nbsp;I only hope they
      are going to act, with us in the capture of Richmond, which it seems to me should
      be taken, without any more blowing and talking.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother you ask if my throat troubles me any now. Not a bit, &nbsp;I never felt better in
      my life, &nbsp;one thing I have learned in this war, and that is, that I can stand almost
      any amount of exposeure, as I have found by experience, Mother dont fail to let me hear from you as soon as you get the money, and when you write to Han tell
      her to be Sure and write to me.
   </p>

   <p id="duk.00332_n2">2. This was a series of
      land-sea operations, commanded by the luckless General Banks (see George
      Washington Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman from ),
      to capture the coastal territory in the South. It culminated in the costly siege
      of Port Hudson, Louisiana (May 21, 1863 to July 9, 1863), which was compelled to
      surrender only after the capitulation of Vicksburg on July 4, 1863.<a href="#r2">[back]
