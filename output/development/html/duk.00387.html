      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I want to write to you of yourself. It is better to translate you than Epictetus or
      Marcus Antoninus.<sup><a href="#duk.00387_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> To translate you one must be in sympathy
      with you. I think I am in sympathy with you. I can see that you are a limpid man,
      a
      realist, one who looks through all words and shows and bearing into the secret nature
      with a terrible perception. You look inward, inward at the soul of things. You are
      terrible for finding a way into the depths. Your poetry is of a new order. You breathe
      the Modernesque, nothing of the Antique in you. Something flows in your veins warmer
      than ice-water. Conscientious, earnest, you talk plain words, and command your publisher
      not to alter a line. Thus, some of your passages seem profane, sometimes blasphemous
      to
      the world—you do not hesitate to shock any weather-worn creed or belief.
   </p>
   
   <p>Damn your critics!</p>
   
   <p>Hear this what I say—</p>
   
   <p>You are a greater Stoic than Xeno or Scævola or Xenophanes,<sup><a href="#duk.00387_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> greater, because nothing of impurity clings to you. You are a
      man whose core and whose breath is conscience, and now I say that not one of these
      critics (?) not one of the old giants of literature, not one of Europe's best but
      could
      come to you and say <em>Peccavi.</em>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have lived twenty-one years and society has just begun with me. <em>You</em> I have found and with you I talk. I am in moods and anxieties, but you
      elevate me. And when I am above them, and in those grand still moments in which one
      sees
      infinite things, even then I find you far above, and out of your experience and
      helpfulness looking down at me.
   </p>
   
   <p>How long have I been a stranger to this foreign land in which I have
      wandered—foreign, and yet within my own heart? For when most you talk to me of
      yourself, then most do you talk to me of myself. Is this not true?
   </p>
   
   <p>Emerson<sup><a href="#loc.01149_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> told me to seek you. 'You shall find much of genius
      there,' said he, in his kind, quaint way; and Thoreau,<sup><a href="#n0633" id="r4">4</a></sup> you know how
      he speaks of you in his 'Letters.' But Emerson did not say the best thing. I find
      Genius
      here, indeed, but so I can find it in Shakespeare, and Mrs. Browning,<sup><a href="#n3045" id="r5">5</a></sup> and in the effete books.
   </p>
   
   <p>But human heartedness, but self-giving, but brave sense, mettle, hard and heavy force,
      laconic energy, when books swim in loquacious impotence, how shall I seek them
      elsewhere? All lives beside are comparatively objectless and dull and dreary in the
      prospect. Amid all shame and falsehood around and in me, in you I ever find clearly
      acknowledged and outspoken the truth.
   </p>
   
   <p>You are of great practical value.</p>
   
   <p>You are a royal fellow.</p>
   
   <p>Can I serve you?</p>
   
   <p>God damn Sec'y Harlan!</p>
   
   <p>One word of myself: I am twenty-one. Twenty-one looked venerable to me six years ago.
      And, alas, nothing looks venerable to me now. I am pressing the vintage just now for
      the
      wine of hell and stammer curses pretty well. I think there was a devil born in me.
      I
      have got the dual existence the Germans tell us about, body at night, and mind in
      the
      morning, you understand. I am in this village a thousand miles from home, trying to
      study and write verse. But enough of me.
   </p>
   
   <p>I look at your picture in 'Leaves of Grass.' I fancy you are growing old and (is it
      but
      fancy) that you suffer.
   </p>
   
   <p>Will you trust me with one line of yourself. I know you are a poet, older than I,
      and we
      are strangers. But if you could see me you would trust me, for I swear there is
      congruity between us.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your earnest, unique, lyrical words—God bless you for them!</p>
   
   <p>I love you.</p>
   
   <p>(A friend has defended you with a pamphlet has he not. I endeavor in vain to get it.
      Will you not tell me where to send.)

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Johnson Woodbury
      (1844–1927) was a senior at Williams College in 1865 when Ralph Waldo
      Emerson visited the campus. Woodbury, who later worked as an editor and oil
      company executive, published his memories of conversations with Emerson in <em>Talks with Emerson</em> (New York: Baker &amp; Taylor, 1890).
      Whitman objected to the book's characterization of his relationship with
      Emerson; see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden,</em>
      (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1992), 7:49-52; Jerome Loving,

      California: University of California Press, 1999), 471.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00387_n1">1. Epictetus (c. 55–135
      AD) was a Greek stoic philosopher and former slave, whose works had a lasting
      impact on the politics of Marcus Antoninus (121-180 AD), the Roman
      Emperor.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00387_n2">2. While the Greek philosopher
      Zeno of Citium (c. 334–262 BC) is generally considered to be the founder
      of the stoic school of philosophy, such a moniker fits the Roman politician and
      law scholar Quintus Mucius Scaevola (c. 159 - 88 BC) as well as the Greek
      theologian and philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon (c. 570 - c. 475 BC) less
      well. While the former was at least schooled in stoicism (by Panaetius of
      Rhodes), the latter's life predates the philosophical movement and he can at
      best be argued to anticipate stoic thought (although the fragmentary nature of
      Xenophanes' surviving works render such a judgement problematic).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01149_n3">3. Ralph Waldo Emerson
      (1803–1882) was an American poet and essayist who began the
      Transcendentalist movement with his 1836 essay <em>Nature</em>.
      Having read Whitman's first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>,
      Emerson wrote a letter to Whitman, famously pronouncing him to be "at the
      beginning of a great career." In his response, Whitman eagerly addressed the
      Concord philosopher as "Master." Whitman published both Emerson's letter and his
      response in the second edition of .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0633">4. Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) was an American author, poet,
      and abolitionist best known for writing <em>Walden</em> and <em>Civil Disobedience</em>. He was a contemporary of Ralph Waldo
      Emerson and Walt Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3045">5. Elizabeth Barrett Browning
      (1806–1861) was a popular British poet (e.g. <em>Aurora
         Leigh</em>) and the wife of poet and playwright Robert Browning
      (1812–1889).<a href="#r5">[back]
