      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You will be surprised to get a letter from me away off here—I have been taking
      quite a journey the last two months—have been out to the Rocky Mountains and
      Colorado (2000 miles)—(Seems to me I sent you a paper six weeks ago from
      Denver)—I got along very well till about three weeks ago when I was taken sick
      &amp; disabled, &amp; hauled in here in St Louis for repairs, have been here ever
      since—am fixed comfortable—Still somewhat under the weather, (but have
      no doubt I shall be well as usual for me before long)—Shall stay here probably
      two or three weeks longer, &amp; then back east to Camden—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete this is a wonderful country out here, &amp; no one knows how big it is till he
      launches out in the midst of it—But there are plenty of hard-up fellows in
      this city &amp; out in the mines, &amp; all over here—you have no idea how
      many run ashore, get sick from exposure, poor grub &amp;c—many young men, some
      old chaps, some boys of 15 or 16—I met them every where, especially at the RR
      stoppings, out of money &amp; trying to get home—But the general run of all
      these Western places, city &amp; country is very prosperous, on the rush, plenty of
      people, plenty to eat, &amp; apparently plenty of money—Colorado you know is
      getting to be the great silver land of the world—In Denver I visited a big
      smelting establishment, purifying the ore, goes through many processes<sup><a href="#loc.01628_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—takes a week—well they showed me silver
      there by the cart load—Then in middle Colorado, in one place, as we stopt in a
      mining camp I saw rough bullion bars piled up in stacks outdoors five  or six feet high
      like hay cocks—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—So it is—a few make great strikes—like the prizes in the
      lottery—but most are <u>blanks</u>—I was at Pike's
      Peak—I liked Denver City very much—But the most interesting part of my
      travel has been <u>the Plains</u>, (the great American <u>Desert</u> the old geographies call it, but it is no desert)
      largely through Colorado &amp; Western Kansas, all flat, hundreds &amp; even
      thousands of miles—some real good, nearly all pretty fair soil, all for stock
      raising, thousands of herds of cattle, some very large—the herdsmen, (the
      principal common employment) a wild hardy race, always on horseback, they call 'em
      <u>cow-boys</u> altogether—I used to like to get among
      them &amp; talk with them—I stopt some days at a town right in the middle of
      those Plains, in Kansas, on the Santa Fe road—found a soldier<sup><a href="#loc.01628_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> there who had known me in the war 15 years ago—was
      married &amp; running the hotel there—I had hard work to get away from
      him—he wanted me to stay all winter—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The picture at the beginning of this letter is the St Louis bridge over the
      Mississippi river<sup><a href="#loc.01628_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I often go down to the river, or
      across this bridge—it is one of my favorite sights—but the air of this
      city don't agree with me—I have not had a well day, (even for me,) since I
      have been here—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Well Pete dear boy I guess I have written enough—How are you getting along?
      I often think of you &amp; no doubt you often do of me—God bless you, my
      darling friend, &amp; however it goes, you must try to keep up a good
      heart—for I do—
   </p>

      So long—from your old
      <br></br>Walt
