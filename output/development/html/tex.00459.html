      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was glad to get your card &amp; to hear that your 
      health was improved. I thought surely we should see you 
      as you returned from Canada in Sept. I had made great reckoning
      of a long visit with you. We have all been well. I send you 
      a late picture of Julian, but it does not flatter 
      him. He talks everything
      
      
      I showed him your picture in Scribner, &amp; asked him 
      who it was. "It is uncle Alt" he said. I think 
      that picture a good one, better than the photo from which 
      it was taken. Stedman was here in June &amp; I let 
      him have two or three pictures to choose from. He said 
      he had had a big fight with Holland, but had conquered, 
      Holland would have neither piece nor picture. I am 
      satisfied with the essay. It is better than I expected 
      It is my philosophy always 
      
      
      to accept the good &amp; let the bad go to the dogs. The good 
      in the essay will help us; the bad no body will heed 
      It will bring you readers &amp; friends &amp; that is enough. The 
      article is candid &amp; respectful &amp; that is all we can ask. 
      This is a free country &amp; Stedman can think &amp; say what he 
      pleases, so long as he keeps within the bounds of legitimate 
      criticism. His argument is very weak in places, notably 
      on the procreation business. To 
      compare sex &amp; what goes with it, to mud &amp; slime that 
      nature covers up, is a fatal error. In fact it seems 
      
               
      to me that the adverse criticisms in the paper are all 
      weak &amp; ineffectual, &amp; that he is truly at home only when 
      he is appreciative. How gingerly he does walk at times to be 
      sure, as if he feared the ground underfoot was mined. He 
      wrote a propitiatory letter to both me &amp; O'Connor, before 
      the article appeared. He evidently had a wholesome 
      dread of O'Connor's war whoop &amp; scalping knife. But 
      S. is a generous fellow, think how much better he is than 
      the set to which he belongs. 
      A young man from Cambridge Mass. (W.S. Kennedy) 
      writes me that he had a 
      
      
      furious talk with Stedman about the article, &amp; that he 
      himself has written a paper that will appear in the 
      <u>Californian</u> soon, which he 
      thinks does you fuller justice. I do not know him, but he says he expects 
      to go to Phila. soon to work 
      on the <u>American</u>, a news 
      paper started there. He says 
      his paper was accepted by the <u>International</u>, &amp; then
      returned on account of Mr Lodge, one of the editors.
      Dr Bucke is a good fellow, but between me &amp; 
      you, I am a little shy of him; I fear he lacks 
      
      
      balance &amp; proportion &amp; that his book will not be 
      pitched in the right key. But I hope I do him 
      injustice. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p> It is a lovely day here &amp; I am in a mood to bet 
      that Garfield will carry every Northern State. When 
      this reaches you you will know whether I would have 
      lost or won. Write to me.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see

      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
