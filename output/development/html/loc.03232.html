      <br></br><br></br>Dear Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We have started here a plan for some Author's Readings in aid of International
      Copyright, to be given at Madison Square Theatre April 28, 29 &amp; 30, from 4
      o'clock to 6 in the afternoon.
   </p>
   
   <p>The use of the theatre is given free. Five or six authors will read each day. A
      committee of ladies, of prominent &amp; influential position, will dispose of the tickets, &amp;
      all that authors have to do is to give their services. Howells, Warner, Mark Twain,
      Dr. Eggleston &amp; Frank Stockton have all promised to take part. We have hopes,
      also, of Holmes &amp; others. I am asked to invite you to come &amp; read on one of
      the days, &amp; I add to this my own earnest request that you will do so. It will be
      a great help to us, to have you. Regarding the selection you may prefer, please give
      me your views. I know there is a great desire to have you give "When Lilacs Last in
      the Door-yard Bloomed"—or at least a part of it. Will you not heed this
      desire? It would be a revelation—a thing to be remembered for many years.
   </p>
   
   <p>I feel pretty sure that you are in accord with the object, &amp; that you will respond
      to
      the idea that it is well for the authors to help themselves &amp; their foreign
      brothers in this matter—by standing up &amp; <u>doing</u>
      something practical to help on the International Copyright agitation. We shall be
      able with little effort, by this plan, to raise a substantial fund with which to
      prepare for hard work in Congress next December.—The question of expense need
      not stand in your way. We will pay all your expenses.—Please write me
      speedily, in a day or two, so that I may announce your participation.
   </p>

      Always faithfully yours
