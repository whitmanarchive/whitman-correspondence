      <br></br><br></br>Dear Son Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing very new with me—I continue about the same—my general strength the best 
      it has been yet—I go out a little most every day, but it is very cold weather here—I
      was quite non-plus'd at that affair in Bergazzi's with Frank Rives<sup><a href="#loc.01623_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—who is he? Is he some one I know? Was he drunk or loony? tell me more of it—what
      he said—the exact words—It seems unaccountable to me—from what I gather 
      from your letter you did exactly right. If I hadn't met with some queer characters
      myself—&amp; been the subject of such strange &amp; unaccountable remarks—I should hardly
      think any thing of the sort possible—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have occupied myself lately writing—have sent a letter to the Graphic, describing
      the Capitol, 
      which they have accepted, and may publish Saturday or Monday.<sup><a href="#loc.01623_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Have also written a poem which I have sold<sup><a href="#loc.01623_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—will send you one when it appears.—As I write this holding the paper on my lap 
      I am sitting here in the parlor, by the heater—have had my dinner—drank quite a goblet
      of wine, 
      which I believe has flown into my head. (My brother west, &amp; another friend here, 
      have both sent me presents of good wine—&amp; I drink it occasionally, half water—but
      this time I have taken a little extra)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Pete, I thought I would send you a couple of shirts—so I have ordered them made here,
      
      got as near the measure as I could—they will be done in some ten days, perhaps less, 
      &amp; then I will send them. I like mine so well, I have had yours made like them, with
      collars on. 
      I have had no new togs made this winter. I wear my old gray suit, &amp; the old black
      overcoat,—&amp; when very cold, or stormy my gray shawl—If you should see me now leaning
      against Milburn's 
      counter, you wouldn't <u>see any difference from last winter</u>—(but my heart tells a different story)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been in all day, &amp; must get out a little—the evenings are the most tedious
      
      with me—I can manage to put in <u>the days</u>, but these long <u>cold evenings</u>, I think if 
      I only had the right quarters in Washington, <u>my own quarters &amp; a good wood fire, 
         &amp; you with me as</u> often as possible, I should be comparatively happy
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <p id="loc.01623_n1">1. Probably Franklin Rives,
      of F. &amp; J. Rives and George A. Bailey, publishers in Washington. The nature
      of the barroom brawl (see the letter from Whitman to Doyle of ) is not ascertainable.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.01623_n2">2.  "Halls of Gold and
      Lilac" appeared in the New York <em>Daily Graphic</em> on November
      24; reprinted in <em>The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt
         Whitman</em>, ed. Emory Holloway (1921), 2 vols., 2:42–49. Editorially
      the newspaper commented: "Walt Whitman's prose is as remarkable in its way, as
      is his poetry, and is characterized by the same curious rhythm and same wealth
      of color. . . . The public will be glad to learn that Mr. Whitman has in a great
      degree recovered from his recent illness—an illness which had its origin
      in the exposures undergone by Mr. Whitman in the army, and which at one time
      threatened his life. Though not yet as strong as he hitherto has been, he is
      still well enough to resume in a measure his duties at Washington and to wield
      his pen with as much effectiveness as ever."<a href="#r2">[back]
