   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still here in Washington, &amp; work in the same office—My health is good, 
      &amp; there is nothing specially new or important with me since I wrote you last. 
      I have received your letters. Dear boy, I would like to see you, that we might be
      together once more, 
      even if but for a little while—I have thought I would try to journey out your way,<sup><a href="#loc.01687_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> for a few days—but it dont seem practicable just at present—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope you are well—you must write me a good long letter all about your affairs &amp;
      yourself—all will be interesting—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you my love, &amp; to your parents also<sup><a href="#loc.01687_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Tell them I hope yet to meet them—Good bye, dear young man—I too have not forgotten
      those times when you lay sick in the hospital—&amp; our love for each other—such things
      are not easily forgotten—Some day I will try to come out there, &amp; we will see each
      other again.
   </p>
