   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00639_n1">1. This letter dates to
      February 16, 1869. Only the day of the week, Tuesday, is in Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's hand. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter February 18, 1869, and
      Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:367). The subjects of the letter are consistent with February
      1869, but Tuesday fell on February 16 in that year. The month February is
      consistent with early 1869 because the letter discusses the recovery of Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's daughter Hannah Heyde from the amputation of her thumb in a
      December 1868 surgery. Also, Louisa's relief at Walt Whitman's recovery from
      "distress in [his] head" is consistent with symptoms that Walt had listed in an
      early February letter: he had described a "severe cold in my head" and "bad
      spells, dizziness" (see his  letter to Louisa). Those descriptions of symptoms are from the
      portion of Walt's letter dated February 2, but the letter does not indicate a
      full recovery. Louisa's letter can date no earlier than February 9, and Walt's
      recovery was only partial by the weekend. According to the portion of that
      letter written on February 6 (Saturday), he had some relief from "bad spells"
      but no relief from "cold in the head." Therefore, Louisa probably responded to a
      later non-extant letter. February 16 is the earliest possible Tuesday on which
      Louisa could have responded to Walt's reported recovery. Louisa also wrote that
      George Washington Whitman had not received a bank draft and had "parted with
      nearly all he had." George's departure must have been recent because Louisa has
      not heard recently from him in her  letter to Walt, which implies that George, who had been gone for
      several days, had not written. This letter very likely followed Walt's  letter to Louisa and
      preceded Louisa's  letter to
      Walt.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00639_n9">2. Earlier in the month, Walt
      Whitman reported a "severe cold in my head" and "bad spells, dizziness" (see his
       letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman). Walt continued to describe symptoms of a severe cold in the
      portion of that letter written February 6 (Saturday), so Walt's full recovery
      probably dates to a later (non-extant) letter that Edwin Haviland Miller dated
      February 15, 1869 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:361).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00639_n12">4. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided
      in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1892), a
      landscape painter. See Charles Heyde's December 1868 letter for the surgical
      amputation of Hannah's thumb (Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman
         and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949],
      225–226). Miller dated Charles's letter to "[a]bout December 8" (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:72–73, n. 37). For the Whitman
      family's bitterness toward Charles and the stress that Hannah's health crisis
      introduced between Louisa and her son George Washington Whitman, see Horace
      Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.70.html">Wednesday, January 9, 1889</a>, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> (New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914), 3:499–500.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00639_n13">5. George Washington Whitman
      had probably departed to inspect pipe for Moses Lane, which he typically did in
      Camden or Florence, New Jersey. His brother Thomas Jefferson Whitman sent
      monthly drafts of $200 (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00639_n5">6. George Washington Whitman
      sought a loan on a house owned by his partner, a man known only as Smith. He was
      unable to get the loan and eventually sold the mortgage on Smith's house to his
      brother Thomas Jefferson Whitman (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). Walt
      described Smith as "a natural builder and carpenter (practically and in effect)
      architect," and he advised John Burroughs that Smith was an "honest,
      conscientious, old-fashioned man, a man of family . . . . youngish middle age"
      (see Walt's  letter to John
      Burroughs).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00639_n22">7. The <em>Brooklyn Directory</em> (1869) lists two Lotts as lawyers, Abraham and John
      Z., at 13 Willoughby Street. An agent named Lott is mentioned multiple times in
      financial matters concerning George Washington Whitman's speculative
      housebuilding business (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  and  letters to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00639_n4">8. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman had agreed to lend his brother George Washington Whitman $2,000 (see
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter
      to Walt Whitman). Louisa also asked Walt to lend George $500, and Walt extended
      a loan to his brother (see Louisa's 
      letter to Walt). The amount of the loans from Jeff later shifted as George
      agreed to Jeff's purchase of a mortgage. Louisa sought to provide a complete
      accounting for the series of loans in her  letter to Walt.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00639_n14">9. Anna Van Wycke had boarded
      with the Whitmans in Brooklyn, and her parents' farm was near Colyer farm, which
      had belonged to Jesse Whitman, Walt Whitman's paternal grandfather. See Bertha
      H. Funnel, <em>Whitman on Long Island</em> (Port Washington, New
      York: Kennikat Press, 1971), 78. "Lib" was Anna Van Wycke's sister (see Anna's
       letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman [Feinberg Collection, Library of Congress]).<a href="#r9">[back]
