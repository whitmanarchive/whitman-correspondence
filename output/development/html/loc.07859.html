   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="n0839">3. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0336">5. John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For

   <p id="n4995">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <p id="loc.05142_n5">8. Talcott Williams
      (1849–1928) was associated with the New York <em>Sun</em>
      and <em>World</em> as well as the Springfield <em>Republican</em> before he became the editor of the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in 1879. His newspaper vigorously defended Whitman
      in news articles and editorials after the Boston censorship of 1882. For more

   <p id="loc.07350_n2">9. Whitman's birthday
      dinner was held 31 May 1890 at Reisser's Restaurant in Philadelphia. The main
      speaker was Col. Robert G. Ingersoll, and there were also speeches by Richard
      Maurice Bucke and Silas Weir Mitchell. The Camden <em>Daily
         Post</em> article "Ingersoll's Speech" of 2 June 1890 was written by Whitman
      himself and was reprinted in <em>Good-Bye My Fancy</em> (<em>Prose Works, 1892</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall, 2 vols. [New York:
      New York University Press: 1963-1964], 686-687). "Honors to the Poet" appeared
      in the Philadelphia <em>Inquirer</em>, 1 June 1890. See also the
