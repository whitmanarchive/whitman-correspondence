   <p id="med.00666_n1">1. Since Whitman wrote
      several post cards to Harry after he went to Canada, probably the fragment
      reproduced here was sent at this time, since December 8 fell on Saturday in
      1883. In a letter to Whitman from Canada on , Harry complained of his work as "turnkey" in Bucke's asylum, asked
      for letters of recommendation, and concluded: "Your boy is away among strangers
      and a good long letter from his dear friend will do him good." On  Harry asserted: "I am <u>determined</u> to make a hit somewhere and dont forget it.
      I havent had a blue spell yet and think I can get along without any . . . With
      lots of love and a good old time kiss I am ever your boy Harry." According to a
      letter to his father on January 12, 1884, Harry was reading Haeckel and Darwin,
      but was not satisfied with his position at the hospital: "The rules of the
      Asylum are absurdly strict and of a military form."<a href="#r1">[back]
