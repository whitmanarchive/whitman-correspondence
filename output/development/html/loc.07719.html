   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4319">2. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r2">[back]

      to be extant.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.07866_n4">5. Whitman is referring to
      Bucke's son, Edward Pardee Bucke (1875–1913), apparently named after his
      friend Timothy Blair Pardee.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07719_n2">6. Maurice Andrews Bucke
      (1868–1899) was the oldest son of Richard Maurice Bucke and his wife
      Jessie Gurd Bucke. Maurice, named after his father, died in Montana in a
      carriage accident when he was thirty-one years old.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07330_n2">7. Dr. Beemer was in charge of
      the "Refractory Building" at Bucke's asylum. Whitman met Beemer during his visit
      there in the summer of 1880. See James H. Coyne, <em>Richard
         Maurice Bucke: A Sketch</em> (Toronto: Transactions of the Royal Society of
      Canada, 1906), 52.<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="n0625">8. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0231">9. James T. Fields (1817–1881) succeeded James
      Russell Lowell as editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1861
      and held the position until 1871. After Emerson, who had received "Proud Music
      of the Sea-Storm" in Whitman's 
      letter, delivered the poem to Fields, Fields sent $100 to Whitman on . He informed Whitman on  that if he was to get the poem
      into the February issue it would be impossible to send proof to Washington. This
      was the second of Whitman's poems to appear in the <em>Atlantic
         Monthly</em>; "Bardic Symbols" was published in 1861.(For "Bardic Symbols,"
      see Whitman's  letter to James
      Russell Lowell and Whitman's  letter
      to the editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>.)<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07719_n3">10. Whitman is referring to a
      three-column review from the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> of Paul
      B. Du Chailu's <em>The Viking Age</em>; the reviewer was probably
      Melville Phillips.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">11. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
