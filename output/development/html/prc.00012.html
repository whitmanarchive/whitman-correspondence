   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00012_n1">1. The April issue of the
      <em>Galaxy</em> announced that Sheldon and Co. had assumed
      financial control of the journal. The reply to this letter is in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C. The <em>Galaxy</em> in 1868 was more
      than kind to Whitman and his friends. In March appeared O'Connor's satirical
      poem "The Ballad of Sir Ball," 328–333, about the authorship of Florence
      Percy's (Elisabeth Chase Allen) "Rock Me to Sleep." Of the poem Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman wrote on : "it is
      signed W. i hope nobody will think you wrote it walt." In April the magazine
      printed John Burroughs' "Before Genius," 421–426, in which he observed:
      "If we except 'Leaves of Grass' and Emerson's works, there is little as yet in
      American literature that shows much advance beyond the merely conventional and
      scholastic."<a href="#r1">[back]
