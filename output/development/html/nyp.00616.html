   <p>Here I am sitting up in the big chair—I got up ab't noon, (&amp; shall keep up an hour
      or two, &amp; send you my actual <em>sign manual</em> to show proof)—Have been pretty ill,
      indeed might say pretty serious, two days likely a close call<sup><a href="#nyp.00616_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—but Dr Bucke was
      here, &amp; took hold [of] me without gloves—in short, <em>Monday last</em> (four days since) I
      turned the tide pronouncedly &amp; kept the favorable turn Tuesday forenoon—havnt since
      kept the good favoring turn the last two days—but the indications are still
      favorable (good pulse the Dr says last two days) for my getting sort abt as
      usual—Dr B went back to Canada last Tuesday night, R.R. train—I am half thro' on
      my little "November Boughs"—&amp; am stuck of it &amp; proofs &amp;c—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="nyp.00616_n2">2. Troubled by newspaper
      reports of the poet's illness, O'Connor wrote for information on  (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press,
      1953], 4: 499-500). The almost fatal illness during the early part of June is
      fully recorded in Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906), 1: 259ff. Fortunately Richard
      Maurice Bucke, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (1883), had come to Camden on
      June 3 (1: 254), and Nathan M. Baker became the poet's nurse on June 10 (1:
      298). At first Whitman resisted, but for the rest of his life he was not without
      male nurses. On August 10 Traubel noted: "I have started a Whitman fund—am
      trying to get a small monthly guarantee each from a group of people to pay for
      the nurse and the extras required by W.'s persistent illness" (Horace Traubel,
      <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell
      Kennerley, 1915], 2: 116). Among the contributors were Stedman (2: 141), Richard
      Watson Gilder (4: 390), Josephine Lazarus (4: 474), and Andrew Carnegie (4:
      435). When Whitman learned of the fund on March 20, 1889, "he was greatly
      touched: the tears came into his eyes" (4: 390).<a href="#r2">[back]
