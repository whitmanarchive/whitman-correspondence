      <br></br><br></br>Dear Ed
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your good letter has just come &amp; all seems to be in such good spirits with you,
      &amp; every thing right so far—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—When I wrote to your folks a few days ago, (after I heard you had started out) I
      said
      I could not tell of course whether your enterprise would be a <u>pecuniary success</u> or not, but I was certain it would be in showing you a
      different world, and a deeper knowledge not only of general human nature but of
      yourself—(all of which the Scripture calls <u>that
         wisdom</u> which is more precious than worldly riches.) Every young man ought
      to explore something of the outside world,—especially of our American country
      &amp; the west<sup><a href="#loc.03953_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Nothing very new with me—I am well as usual for me—As I write I am up in
      my room Stevens Street—a pretty cold day, &amp; moderate snow &amp; ice on the
      ground, but sun shining bright—quite a good deal of sleighing—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I am busy with my writing in moderation—write four or five hours every
      day—My new book is doing reasonably well (better than I expected) &amp;
      promises to give me a small but steady income—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I have not been down, but shall go before long, &amp; then I will write to you
      again—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I got a letter from Ruth four days ago, &amp; saw Muller yesterday—all your
      folks were as usual—When I go down I shall make Van give me a good
      ride—I got a long letter from Herbert Gilchrist—he is
      well<sup><a href="#loc.03953_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Carpenter ditto—Ed dear boy I won't give you any particular advice
      for I have an idea you know how to take care of yourself both morally &amp;
      physically—&amp; I hope you will prove it—
   </p>
