   <p>Am all right again for me—was sick ab't three weeks—at times pretty bad—was well taken care of here—<em>the best of friends</em> both Dr and Mrs B[ucke] (as <em>human</em> as I ever met, both)—Monday morning next I start on a long Lake &amp; St Lawrence river
      trip, 900 miles (mostly by steamer, comfortable, I reckon)—gone nearly three weeks,
      then back here<sup><a href="#duk.00754_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—May write you from Quebec. Your papers come—

   <p id="duk.00754_n2">2. Whitman left London on
      July 26 for his trip on the St. Lawrence River and returned to London on August
      14. Whitman's account of this journey was published in the London (Canada) <em>Advertiser</em>, the Philadelphia <em>Press</em>, and the Camden <em>Daily Post</em> on August 26. He
      sent the article on August 23 to the Washington <em>Sunday
         Herald</em> (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.). Most of the material was later incorporated into <em>Specimen Days &amp; Collect</em> (1882; see Whitman's <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html"><em>Complete Prose Works</em></a>, 1–202). See
      also the account of this trip in <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in
         Canada</em>, ed. William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard &amp;
      Company, 1904), 16–40.<a href="#r2">[back]
