      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr Osgood
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I suppose you 
      rec'd
      
       the copy yesterday (Saturday) as I sent it the previous day. You
      already have my plan—a volume of say 400 pages, (not over 450) handy size,
      first class (but I know you wouldn't issue any other) in paper, print, binding
      &amp;c: but markedly plain &amp; simple even to Quakerness—I have a desire
      that all through even in capitalization, punctuation &amp;c it shall be so—no
      sensationalism or luxury—a well made book for honest wear &amp; use &amp;
      carrying with you—to retail at $3—
   </p>
   
   <p>The book has not hitherto been really <em>published</em> at
      all—the issues have been <em>
         reconnoisances</em>—printings
      in proof for zealous friends &amp;c.
   </p>
   
   <p>The British market is an important consideration.</p>
   
   <p>The copy I sent will have to be returned before very long to me, for complete minor
      &amp; technical revision, as I did not wait to finish it after receiving your last
      letter.
   </p>
   
   <p>But I reserve any thing further until I hear your definite decision on the main
      point—the publication<sup><a href="#tex.00422_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00422_n1">1. Osgood informed Whitman
      on  that the firm would be "glad to publish
      the book" and proposed a royalty of ten per cent. Again he inquired about
      Worthington's pirated books: "We should like to feel clear that you can control
      the old Thayer &amp; Eldridge plates, so as to stop the issue of any books
      printed from them" (<em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>
      [New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 8:278–279). Osgood returned
      Whitman's copy at the same time, and enclosed a copy of <em>Our
         Poetical Favorites</em> as a sample of what the firm proposed to do with
      Whitman's book.<a href="#r1">[back]
