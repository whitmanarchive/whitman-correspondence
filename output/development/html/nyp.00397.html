      <br></br><br></br>Dear Uncle Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I feel very anxious to hear from you so I thought I would drop a few lines to you
      to let you know that I have not forgotten you but often think of you.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all very well at the present &amp; hope these few lines may find you in the best
      of health &amp; enjoyments. Our Little Walt Whitman is well &amp; Growing very fast. Dover
      is very dull at the present &amp; no prospect for any better this fall &amp; Winter..from
      the present prospects I for one will be out of employment this Winter. I hardly know
      what I shall do as I have a family to keep now
   </p>
   
   <p>Hopeing to hear from you soon &amp; also to hear of your being well&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      We all join in sending our Love to you. &amp; may God bless you in your old age&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Please write soon to me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William H. Millis Jr. was the son of William H.
      Millis Sr., who corresponded with Whitman during the war about the condition of
      his wounded son (see Millis Sr.'s 
      letter to Whitman). Whitman described Millis Jr., upon first meeting: "Wm H
      Millis co E 8th Penn Cav. Gen Gregg's old reg. Bridgeville Sussex co Del bed 33
      Ward B May 8th '64 / g s w in Chestâ€”w in left arm father living in Bridgeville
      Del" (<em>NUPM</em> 2:728). Millis Jr. first wrote to Whitman on
      , thanking him for his letter
      (not extant) and proclaiming, "May god bless you forever I cant find words to
      tell you the love thier is in me for you. I hope you &amp; I may live to meet
      again on this earth if not I hope we shall meet in the world w[h]ere there is no
      more parting."
