   <p>William<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup> is gaining but is very weak and not back to the place he
      was before the attack. We speak and think of you <em>much</em>. He has
      sat up a part of the day, but is now, at 4 P.M., sleeping. I hope to have still
      better news soon to send.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
