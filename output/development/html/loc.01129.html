      is put through &amp; we have time enough to go to work in order.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I presume I shall go to NY. on Thursday: if you want to write to me there, write care of Scribner &amp; Co 743 Broadway.</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0129">1. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0871">2. Richard Watson Gilder
      (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <em>The Century</em>, from 1881 until his death. Whitman had met
      Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1955], 482). Whitman attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
      Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the <em>New York Tribune</em>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder
      one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
      delirium" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">Sunday, August 5, 1888</a>). For more about Gilder, see Susan L.
      Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_95.html">Gilder, Richard Watson (1844–1909)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1043">3. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3001">4. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885), widow to Alexander Gilchrist, and her four children Beatrice,
      Grace, Percy and Herbert. Anne Gilchrist wrote one of the first significant
      pieces of criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's
      Estimate of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M.
      Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59.
      Gilchrist's long correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in
      love with the poet after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she
      visited Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. Anne's son Herbert (1857–1914) was
      a painter and shared his mother's fascination for Whitman. For more on Whitman
      and the Gilchrists, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
