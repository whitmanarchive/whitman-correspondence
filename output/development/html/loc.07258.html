   <p>Your letter of 13th<sup><a href="#loc.07258_n6" id="r2">2</a></sup> to Burroughs,<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r4">4</a></sup> and myself written on the back of Mrs
      Costelloe's<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> letter to you reached me last evening.
      Burroughs sent it to O'C. and he to me and with it the little note which I enclose.
      I have written a long letter to O'C. to try to cheer him up a bit, I fear he is in
      a
      bad way. That paralisis of the eyelid (Ptosis) 
      I fear will not let up. It is an extension of the disease (sclerosis) that has troubled
      him so long and a disease of
      this kind is a good deal more in the habit of going <u>forwards</u> than <u>backwards</u>.<sup><a href="#loc.07258_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>  
   
   <p>It is still raining here (beats the Dutch how it rains) we have had  hardly a fine day in a
      month and it <u>looks</u> this morning as if we shd never 
      have fine weather again. It is well enough (as Longfellow says) that
      <u>some</u> days should be dark and dreary—but I don't
      see the fun of so much cloudy weather.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad you like the Photo—I have not had many printed from it yet, been
      waiting for bright weather to try another negative but I agree with you that the one
      I sent you is very good. No word yet from Wm Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r7">7</a></sup> in re meter—I shall not be able to fix the time of my
      going East untill I hear from him (and perhaps not when I <u>first</u> hear from him). Yours of 21st<sup><a href="#loc.07258_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup> just to
      hand—I have not seen <u>any</u> of the papers you mention,
      wish you or Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r9">9</a></sup> wd send them &amp; the Critic<sup><a href="#loc.07258_n5" id="r10">10</a></sup> with your letter in when it comes out. We are
      all well and all goes on as usual—quiet and pleasant. Shall write again
      soon

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0129">3. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see

      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">5. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07258_n2">6. On October 20, 1888,
      O'Connor had written Bucke that "a month ago my right eye closed, and the
      lid had not yet lifted, spite of battery. So I am practically blind" (See
      Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence of Walt
         Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1969], 4:227n89).
      Earlier that year, January 23, 1888, O'Connor had described one of his
      attacks for Bucke:<br><br>
      "My state of health is exasperating. Everyone says I look very well and I
      feel reasonably so but for the horrible lameness and feebleness. Last Monday
      (the 16<u>th</u>) I had a new experience. I sat down to
      dinner, suddenly felt a curious <u>still</u> feeling,
      pushed back my chair, and became perfectly insensible. It was then five
      o'clock in the afternoon. When I came to it was ten. The room was lighted,
      and four doctors were around me, and my wife and a couple of neighbors. I
      thought I had died, did not know where I was, and for about an hour could
      not articulate. Then I began to realize I was still in the world, and began
      a resolute effort to have three or four messages written for me, for I
      tranquilly thought I was dying. I succeeded, and was then helped up stairs
      and put to bed, where I remained for the rest of the week. It was a tough of
      apoplexy, incident to my malady the doctor said, and a small blood vessel in
      my head had broken. Now I am no worse than usual, save that I am very
      feeble; and I go to the office, though I can't do much." (See the letter
      from O'Connor to Bucke of October 20, 1888 in the Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<br><br>
      As Bucke had predicted, this was the sort of disease that "is a good deal
      more in the habit of going <u>forwards</u> than <u>backwards</u>." On , Ellen O'Connor, William Douglass O'Connor's wife, wrote to
      Whitman about her husband's worsening condition and his epileptic
      seizures.<br><br>
      "Dear Walt, I have not been able to write you again, for W<u>m</u>. has been &amp; is very ill. On the 6<u>th</u> Wed. he had five of those epileptic seizures,
      the last four from 5 P.M. to 9.30 going from one to another, without
      recovering consciousness. He has not been up since, is very weak &amp; sick,
      &amp; his mind not clear yet. Will send word again as soon as I can. With
      love— Nelly O'C." (Artem Lozynsky, ed., <em>The Letters
         of Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman </em> [Detroit: Wayne State
      University Press, 1977], 75n2.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n4284">7. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="n4267">9. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
