   <p>Another month commenced and am greatly in hopes we are to have some fine weather to
      make up for the nearly 40 days rain we have had. At all events the month has opened
      well. A lovely bright, hazy, warm, fresh autumn morning. I got yesterday the bundle
      of papers including "Critic" and was much interested in the review of Crawford's
      "Kalevala."<sup><a href="#loc.07261_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Also in the "Tribune" article on what New York is doing in the way of provision for
      her insane—this is a live issue with us here at present and I forwarded the
      article with a letter to Honble A.S. Hardy (Provincial
      Secretary)<sup><a href="#n4176" id="r3">3</a></sup> recommending that we do something of the same sort. In the
      afternoon came <u>McKay's</u><sup><a href="#n4983" id="r4">4</a></sup> "November
      Boughs"<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r5">5</a></sup>—for which many thanks, I like it well
      and if I had not seen the other should have thought <u>it</u>
      quite perfect, as it is I like <u>your</u> "N.B." with the limp
      cover best. Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r6">6</a></sup> tells me that Musgrove<sup><a href="#loc.07239_n2" id="r7">7</a></sup> is to leave on Sunday or Monday morning. I have written
      Ed. Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r8">8</a></sup> and will have him leave here by 11.40 train Sunday
      morning. He will reach Philadelphia about 8 a.m. Monday. I shall give him full
      directions to your house and letters to you and to Mrs Davis.<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      Still no word from W<u>m</u> Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r10">10</a></sup>—looks as if he has had an attack of agraphia—inability to
      write—confound the fellow he promised to let me know every few days how he was
      getting on and has only written one letter in 2½ weeks. All well here had a big
      crowd of young folk at the house last evening (All-Hallow-E'en) telling fortunes,
      dancing &amp;c &amp;c great fun

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4983">4. David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For

   <p id="n4267">6. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="loc.07239_n2">7.  W. A. Musgrove replaced Dr.
      Nathan M. Baker as Whitman's caregiver on July 15, 1888. Musgrove was far less
      satisfactory than Baker. Traubel noted that "Musgrove is a cloudy man. I asked
      how M. got on. W. evaded the question by some general remark. . . . He
      [Musgrove] is only a nurse—not a doctor" (Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.2.html">Monday, July 16, 1888</a>). Yet, Whitman later described Musgrove as
      "kind active &amp; considerate all through" (See the letter from Whitman to
      Bucke of .<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">8. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="n6113">9. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,

   <p id="n4284">10. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
