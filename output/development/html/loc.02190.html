       27th 1883.
      
      <br></br><br></br>My dear old Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>For the last 3 weeks I have been upon the point of penning you a little description
      of a little town I and my sister have just taken down in Devon &amp; Somerset. I
      don't know whether you have scenery like Lyme-regis in America, rich in
      thistles tangled weeds &amp; smooth grass growing down to the waters edge. Had some
      capital bathes in the sea.—always think of you when I am by the sea.—it
      was a [
      <span class="unclear">shingly?</span>]
       coast at
      low water, so I went in, in a pair of old boots to protect my feet from the
      stones.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>At an old farm in Somerset at a village—West Lambrook—There was a great
      chimney corner in which a body could sit on the oak settle and see a star or two up
      the chimney, how jolly it was and how you would have revelled in it I could but
      think.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I heard some strange Somersetshire stories, this is one—Lord Portman's steward
      died a rich man and willed at his death his best horse should be killed &amp; buried
      by his side in order that at the day of resurrection, he could mount his steed and
      be fast in at the day of judgement. And to circumvent evil disposed persons who
      might dig him up for the new  harness upon the horse, his men sat up ploughing all night over
      his grave so that no one could identify the spot: this happened some 20 or 30
      years since. The Somersetshire men put a Z in everything, "I zaid I zhould."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Very much interested in John Burroughs article in the Century of 
      Aug:
      
       upon Carlyle, presents his hero in a clear and telling manner, though I
      think he and Emerson are mistaken in thinking manliness predominated over intellect
      with C—truer I should say of dear old Dr. Johnson.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope that you will read mothers book,—<u>Lamb was a man</u>. If you get at the Lambs I am sure you will like them &amp; see
      that the good Thomas was rather out in his judgment of them.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>October 22nd.</p>
   
   
   <p>I was immensely interested in Mrs. Price's and your other
      great friend the pilot's letters about you in Dr. Bucke's book. Dr. Bucke writes
      genially too.
