      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete, Dear son,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am getting over my late bad spell—I have been very sick indeed, the feeling
      of death &amp; dizziness, my head swimming a great deal of the time—turning
      like a wheel—with much distress in left side, keeps me awake some nights all
      night—the doctor says, however, these troubles, in his opinion, are from a
      very serious &amp; obstinate <u>liver affection</u>—<u>not</u> from head,
      lungs, heart,—he still thinks there is nothing but what I will get the better
      of—(&amp; we will trust he is a true prophet)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wrote about like the foregoing to Mrs.
      O'Connor,<sup><a href="#loc.01671_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> but was too sick to repeat it to
      you—&amp; that was one reason I asked you to go up there,—I 
      havn't
      
       been out for three weeks, but ventured out yesterday for an hour, &amp;
      got along better than I expected—&amp; shall go out, or try to, to-day, as it
      is very pleasant—You must not be needlessly alarmed, my darling boy, for I
      still think I shall get, at any rate partially well &amp; strong enough—The
      doctor is quite encouraging—comes every day—&amp; I feel a good heart
      yet—My young fireman friend Alcott<sup><a href="#loc.01671_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> (I
      think I mentioned his sickness,) is dead &amp; buried, poor fellow—I send you
      a bit of piece of mine about him from the paper—I have some spurts of visits,
      &amp; company—but very little that goes to the right spot, with me—my
      brother George has got a horse &amp; light wagon, &amp; takes me out now &amp;
      then—I enjoy it much—but I have been too feeble lately—altogether
      pretty lonesome here, but might be much worse—Love to Mrs. &amp; Mr. Nash,
      &amp; to all inquiring friends
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
