   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00109_n1">1. Mrs. Vine Coburn was a
      member of a distinguished Maine family; see <em>Walt Whitman
         Review</em> 15 (1969), 59n. The two-volume set was sent on March 7 after
      Whitman's two-week stay with the Staffords (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles
      E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00109_n2">2. Whitman began to supply
      the Children's Home in Camden with signed photographs on November 17, 1876, and
      also sold them himself "for the benefit of the orphans" (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book). The photograph, signed "Walt Whitman 1881," is the 1872 photograph of
      Frank Pearsall; see frontispiece to <em>The Correspondence</em>
      (New York: New York University Press, 1961–69), vol. 2; <em>The Artistic Legacy of Walt Whitman</em> (1970), figure 14; and <em>Specimen Days</em> (1971), plate 148.<a href="#r2">[back]
