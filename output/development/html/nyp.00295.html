      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall return to Washington next Saturday, 15th—William, it would be a favor
      if you would secure me a room to lodge &amp; quarter in<sup><a href="#nyp.00295_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—(look at the Dyer
      Hotel—it is a one-horse place, but might answer—or the Union hotel at
      Georgetown)—just needed for temporary purposes, (unless I find it
      sufficiently inviting to make me a "permanency")—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I do not feel to be very particular—only it would be so much off one's mind to
      have a specific point to make for—Write to me, so that I may get the letter
      Friday, 14th—or else meet me at the depot at 10 Saturday evening, if
      eligible—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>All goes "as well as could be expected" with me—that's the phrase you know in
      parturition cases—&amp; have not I been just delivered—&amp; of
      triplets?<sup><a href="#nyp.00295_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I am hearty in
      health, &amp; good spirits, Mother is well—also George—&amp; in fact the
      whole Whitman family.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Have not heard a word from you or Nelly, since your letter—Has Nelly returned
      yet? Where is Charles Eldridge? I write this in my room home, early
      afternoon—Mother &amp; I having had tete-a-tete dinner—so good &amp;
      quiet—&amp; this bright mellow October weather around us—I am now off
      for a couple of hours on the river &amp; bay.
   </p>
