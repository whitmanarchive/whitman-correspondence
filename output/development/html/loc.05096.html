      <br></br><br></br>My Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your welcome letter to hand. I have longed for a word from you—could not write
      myself—was stricken dumb—nay, there is nothing but silence for me still.
      Herby wrote to Mrs. Stafford first, thinking that so the shock would come less
      abruptly to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I heard of you at Concord in a kind long letter from Frederick Holland, with whose
      wife you had some conversation. Indeed all that sympathy and warm &amp; true words
      of love &amp; sorrow &amp; highest admiration &amp; esteem for my darling could do
      to comfort me I have had—and most &amp; best from America. And many of her
      poor patients at Edinburgh went sobbing from the door when they heard they should
      see her no more.
   </p>
   
   <p>The report of your health is comforting dear friend. Mine too is better—I am
      able to take walks again—though still liable to sudden attacks of difficult
      breathing.
   </p>
   
   <p>Herby is working hard—has just been disappointed over a competition design
      which he sent in to the Royal Academy—a very poor &amp; specious work
      obtaining the premium—but is no whit discouraged &amp; has no need to be, for
      he is making great progress—works hard, loves his work &amp; is of the stuff
      where of great painters are made, I am persuaded—so he can afford to wait.
      Giddy is not quite so well &amp; strong as I could wish, but there seems nothing
      serious. She is working diligently at the development of her voice—&amp; is
      learning German. Dr. Bucke's friend, Mr. Buxton Forman, &amp; his wife are very
      warm, staunch friends of Herby's.
   </p>
   
   <p>Please give my love to your sister, and tell her that her good letter spoke the right
      words to me &amp; that I shall write before very long. Thanks for the paper, dear
      friend—&amp; for those that came when I was too overwhelmed but which I have
      since read with deep interest—those about your visit to your birthplace. With love
      from us all—good-bye, dearest Friend.
   </p>
