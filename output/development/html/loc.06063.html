      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> William<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup> and I are here at Dr. Channing's<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n5" id="r2">2</a></sup> home. I brought William out here from Washington in the
      hope that the climate might arrest the progress of his disease. It was a serious
      undertaking to bring so sick a man three thousand miles on a railroad train, and he
      was much exhausted when he arrived. He has hardly recovered from the effect of the
      journey as yet. In fact, he is worse that he has ever been. Can walk very little
      without the assistance of a friendly arm. If any improvement is to be achieved, it
      must come hereafter.
   </p>
   
   <p> This is a garden of fruit and flowers. . . .</p>
   
   
   <p>William and I received here (forwarded from Washington) letters from Mr.
      Lovering,<sup><a href="#n4250" id="r3">3</a></sup> M.C., relative to your hospital services. William
      was unable to answer, much to his regret, but I did the best I could on my own
      account. Hope for a favorable result. . . . 
   </p>
   
   <p> He [O'Connor] has received an indefinite leave of absence from the Treasury
      Department with pay. He says he will write you as soon as he can. He sends much
      love, and so do I. Sorry to hear from the newspapers that your health is so feeble.
      Wish you could come out here and get strong. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n2002">1. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00945_n5">2. William F. Channing
      (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
      Whitman stayed at his home in October, 1868.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4250">3. Henry Bacon Lovering
      (1841–1911) held several political positions at state and federal levels.
      Lovering represented Massachusetts' sixth district in the U.S. House of
      Representatives between 1883 and 1887, and was appointed as the United States
      Marshal for Massachusetts by President Grover Cleveland in 1888. He later served
      as the United States Pension Agent at Boston between 1894 and 1898. Lovering was
      involved in efforts to get Whitman a government pension in recognition of his
      Civil War hospital service.<a href="#r3">[back]
