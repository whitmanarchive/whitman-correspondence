      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I get a few good letters on my little essay on the poets. Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r6">6</a></sup> thinks the old poetical forms all sound &amp; good &amp; likely to last. So does Stedman.<sup><a href="#n1043" id="r7">7</a></sup> he says he is "a universalist in art."—which I do not like. We are not to be universalists
      in painting &amp; sculpture are we (I guess not) &amp; revive the idiotic sculptures of India,
      Aegypt &amp; Palenque, or the old wood paintings of the Pre-Giottesque painters? Things
      grow obsolete—worn out. Yet Stedman welcomes heartily, he says, the idea of a new
      &amp; grander style in poetry. But I'm sure 
      
      I don't know why I dwell on him: A lady had his volume here in the house yesterday,
      &amp; I re-read part of what he says on you. It seems to me not only insulting but terribly
      small &amp; boomerangish in its tendency, self-condemning, utterly inadequate, not touching
      the real heart of the matter at all—a dwarf walking round a giant, a pigmy measuring
      a god. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Knortz<sup><a href="#uva.00476_n1" id="r8">8</a></sup> sent 2 of the pamphlets to Germany. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r9">9</a></sup> took 10. 
      
      I have been advertizing it—(ever since it was out—) in <u>Critic</u> &amp; <u>Index</u>, &amp; one is to appear in the <u>Lit. World</u>.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you are not feeling badly this rather unhealthy weather. I receive &amp; read with
      gratitude all the clippings you send me. Am hard at work on a Ruskin anthology for
      Pirate Alden, &amp; feel rather knavish over the job.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00418_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd Jan. 21/86." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service |
      Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Camden | Jan | 4 | 4 PM | 1886 | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00418_n2">2. January 4 fell on Monday
      in 1886.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00418_n3">3. Later that year, on
      August 24, Whitman lent $50 to Colonel James Matlack Scovel (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.), and see the letter from
      Whitman to Scovel on . On , Scovel thanked his "dear old friend."
      In 1888 Scovel reported "some ultra-intimate suspicions to [William Sloane]
      Kennedy about W.'s private life," which "shocked" the poet (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell
      Kennerley, 1914], 1:278–279).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">4. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="n0129">6. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1043">7. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00476_n1">8. Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">9. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r9">[back]
