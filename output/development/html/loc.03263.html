      <br></br><br></br>My Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>For so you seem to me just like a grandfather whom I once knew years ago, but who
      lives in my memory as a childish recollection. No, I have never seen you with my
      physical eyes, but I feel as though I had, and it is my love for your work, and
      through that for yourself that prompt me to write you and declare it. I long thought
      of stretching out my hands across the water in greeting to you, but that diffidence
      I had lest I might be intruding unwarrantably upon your quiet has hitherto prevented
      me. This has now passed away through the kindness of a new-found friend—Dr.
      Johnston<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r1">1</a></sup> of Bolton—who tells me he has sent you a
      copy of "Great Thoughts" containing my small addition to the literature [
      <span class="unclear">appreciation?</span>]
       of your
      prophetic messages and high-souled songs. May this be my excuse for thrusting my small
      personality into the path of your Kingly one.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is now about five years ago, (when I was 21, and looked something like the
      photograph I enclosed) since I first remember reading any of your poems, and that
      was in a small anthology. From that time I wished to read more of them, and, making
      discoveries for myself, I at last found "Leaves of Grass"—one of the late
      editions—and rejoiced as over a discovery of hid treasure. Needless to tell
      you, I read it through, and lost no time in buying "Specimen Days."
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>It does not need an Indian to find my trail through the "Leaves of Grass." It is
      broad and thick. Thumb marks, ink scratches, pencil notes, and dear old
      stains—each one has its history, and is looked upon as an old friend. Even my
      Bible is not so bemarked.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your volume holds a princely place in my ranks of 600; for to it I owe so much of
      what is now mine, and a never-ceasing interest in all that appertains to life. My
      eyes have been opened to a truer view of the Bible, of Shakespeare̬yea, of all
      the great minds that have enriched mankind. And for all this—this that makes
      life so truly happy, I thank <u>you</u>.
   </p>
   
   <p>I need hardly say how gratified I should be if it pleased you to write to me, if only
      a line.
   </p>
   
   <p>We may never meet on this earth, and I would like to be as near to you as possible
      in
      the next way—by a personal letter. In the after-days we shall surely
      meet—somehow, somewhere; and then we shall see, and know, and understand.
   </p>
   
   <p>To you—of all of the best that even God has divined here and
      hereafter—love, honour, glory and power.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good bye my master and my friend!</p>
   
   <p>Think that I grasp your hand as long as all may or even so little longer.</p>
   
   <p>Good bye, and again my thanks—as yours, "a soldier's, traveller's thanks."</p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Au revoir! et à Dieu
      <br></br>Ever sincerely
      <br></br>Edmund Mercer.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4102">1. John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,

         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
