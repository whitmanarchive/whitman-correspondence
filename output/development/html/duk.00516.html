   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00516_n10">1. Richard Maurice Bucke dated
      this letter March 3. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date and assigned
      the year 1868 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:365). March 3 fell on Tuesday
      in 1868, which matches Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's date "tuesday noon." The year
      1868 is consistent both with a recent visit to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman by
      Ellen M. O'Connor and daughter and with Louisa's detailed report on the family
      of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in St. Louis, Missouri. She relied on a
      February 24, 1868 letter from Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman for that report.
      Because the letter is consistent with Louisa's usual practice of reporting to
      Walt on Jeff's family and on her recent visitors, the O'Connors, this letter
      dates to March 3, 1868.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00516_n11">2. Neither of these late
      February or early March letters from Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      is extant. Edwin Haviland Miller dated one of these missing letters March 1,
      1868 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 2:360), and the letter received on Friday
      would probably date February 28, 1868.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00516_n1">3. Jennie (or Jenny) was the
      daughter of William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor. Walt Whitman had
      recommended that Ellen and her daughter make a visit to his mother (see his  letter to Nelly). For a time Walt
      Whitman lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles
      Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the
      Washington years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of
      the pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">4. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">5. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="duk.00516_n4">6. The remainder of this page
      and most of the next, until the subject changes to George Washington Whitman's
      work with the water commissioners, summarizes Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's
      February 24, 1868 letter to Louisa (see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1977], 48–50). Mattie was the wife of Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two
      daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In early 1868, Mattie and her daughters
      moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the
      position of Superintendent of Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H.
      Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 1–16.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="duk.00516_n12">7. Jessie Louisa Whitman
      (1863–1957) was the younger daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman
      and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and sister-in-law.
      Jessie and her sister Manahatta "Hattie" were both favorites of their uncle
      Walt.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">8. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00516_n3">9. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. He later
      designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city
      engineer. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in her  letter conveyed Jeff Whitman's confidence that George Whitman's
      connection to Moses Lane offered assurance of stable employment. For more
      information on Walt Whitman's dealings with Lane, see Whitman's  letter to Jeff Whitman.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">10. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r10">[back]

   <p id="duk.00469_n13">11. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a French-born landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa
      Whitman (1823–1908), Walt Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington,
      Vermont. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive
      letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman often spoke
      disparagingly of Heyde in her letters to Walt: "i had a letter or package from
      charley hay three sheets of foolscap paper and a fool wrote on them" (see her
       to Walt).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00516_n9">12. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and son Edward continued to reside at the Atlantic Street boarding house until
      September 1868, when they moved to a house constructed by George Washington
      Whitman at 1149 Atlantic Avenue (<em>Brooklyn City Directory</em>
      1869). Walt Whitman assisted with the move by "hiring a stout young laboring
      man" (see his  letter to Peter
      Doyle).<a href="#r12">[back]
