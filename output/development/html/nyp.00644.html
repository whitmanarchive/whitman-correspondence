   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="nyp.00644_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Wm D O'Connor | 1015 O Street N W | Washington D C. It is postmarked: Camden,
      N.J. | Feb 26 | 8 PM | 89; Washington, Rec'd | Feb 27 | 7 AM | 89 | 7.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.07230_n2">3. Bucke and his brother-in-law
      William John Gurd were designing a gas and fluid meter to be patented in Canada
      and sold in England.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6172">4. Whitman is referring to Thomas W.
      H. Rolleston's selected translation, which was the first book-length translation
      from Whitman to be published in Germany, and which was revised by Dr. Karl
      Knortz and published as <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> (Zurich:
      Verlags-Magazin, 1889). For more on this, see <em>Whitman and
         Rolleston: A Correspondence</em>, ed. Horst Frenz (Bloomington, IN: Indiana
      University Press, 1951), and Walter Grünzweig and Vanessa Steinroetter, "'<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/poets/german/intro.html">Leaving it to you to prove and define': 'Poets to Come' and Whitman's
