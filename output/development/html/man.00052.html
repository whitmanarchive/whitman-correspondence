   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0858b">1. Elmer E. Stafford
      (1861–1957) was a cousin of Harry Stafford, a young man who Whitman
      befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's parents, George and Susan Stafford, were
      tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman
      visited them on several occasions. For more on Whitman and the Staffords, see
      David G. Miller, "Stafford, George and Susan M." <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, ed., (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 685.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1059">2. Based on an address mounted in
      Whitman's Commonplace Book, Horner was the nickname of Jacob H. Stafford
      (1850–1890), Harry Stafford's cousin, whose mother was Mary Horner.<a href="#r2">[back]

      Camden, which is also a part of Camden County, New Jersey.<a href="#r3">[back]
