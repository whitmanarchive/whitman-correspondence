      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Whitman—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I return the J. Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r1">1</a></sup> Book. &amp; the
      pamphlet with thanks. The Burroughs book fed me on my journey home, so that I had
      to buy no other reading.
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall cherish the memory of that blessed January 2nd '85 to the end of my
      days.
   </p>
   
   <p>My dear Whitman, I want you to regard me as a sort of son; tell me whenever I can
      do
      anything for you; let me loan you 5.00 if you get in a pinch, (&amp; I have
      it). It is not always easy to borrow on real estate you know, or convenient I mean.
      &amp; behave handsomely, &amp; intimately &amp; affectionately toward me.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am going to enclose a $1.00 between fly-leaves of the Burroughs' book as half pay
      for a copy of the new edition of yr poems when it comes out. If it shd never come
      out, all right. I owe you $10. more anyway; for I  got you to make me a present
      of yr books under false pretenses. I have not lectured on you more than once, &amp; shall
      
      		feel that I am a fraud until I have sent you $10. Say not a word.
   </p>
   
   <p>I know you are rich: all poets are. But I want you to have luxuries, now you are
      getting old.
   </p>
   
   <p>If this humbug government were worth a copper spangle it 
      wd
      
       have settled a handsome
      pension on you—an honorary life salary—as a recognition of your
      unparalleled services during the war. But it 
      wd
      
       probably be odious to you to even have the subject whispered of ? ?
   </p>
   
   <p>I found brave little wife well, &amp; got a hearty welcome. Our pretty &amp;
      remarkably smart cat died the day I returned—whereat tears &amp; swelling
      breasts, &amp; a private funeral.
   </p>
   
   <p>I must send you my N. Orleans articles. My Creole article in [
      <span class="unclear">Lit. Wld.?</span>]
       is paid for, but
      not out for 3 weeks.
   </p>
   	     
   <p>As is my paper entitled</p>
   
   <p><u>"The New Ars Poetica"<sup><a href="#loc.02599_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup></u></p>
   
   <p>if you <u>can</u> get a certain number of copies disposed of in
      advance, enough to cover expense (say $25 (?)) it 
      wd
      
       be the means of my being able
      to publish it. Dr. Bucke will take a certain number, &amp; I shall sell a few I
      suppose. 
      Wd
      
       20 cts be too high a price for it?
   </p>
   
   <p>Let me know what success you have in the matter. But dont go to any trouble.</p>

   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>It strikes me that it 
      wd
      
       be better to write that essay or preface, &amp; let it
      be published among yr collected prose works say after yr death—rather
      than put it before the poems themselves. I too have "qualms" about this latter.
      Yr new poems will give value enough to the new edition.
   </p>
   
   <p>I believe you will stand stronger, Walt, if you stick to yr old way of 
      		<u>not explaining</u> unless in a prose essay in a
      separate volume, as I said.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0129">1. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="loc.02599_n1">2. Kennedy had been writing a
      defense of Whitman and sent a manuscript of the essay to Whitman on . Growing impatient, he reminded
      the poet to answer his letter on . Over
      two months later, on , Whitman responded,
      finding the manuscript "all right" as well as "lofty, subtle &amp; true" but
      suggesting Kennedy add "a criticism on <u>Tennyson and Walt
         Whitman</u> (or if you prefer on <u>Victor Hugo, T and
