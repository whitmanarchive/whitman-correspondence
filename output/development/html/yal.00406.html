   <p>I am sitting up on the side of the bed writing this. Every thing is going on as well
      with
      me as I could expect. I rec'd your letter, dear mother—you may rest assured that I
      write the <em>exact facts</em> about my sickness—I am not gaining very
      fast, but it is <em>sure</em>—I am on the gain every day a
      little—I still have a good deal of distress in the head—the quieter I am left by
      general visitors the more comfortable I am—I slept fairly last night—&amp; eat
      quite a nice breakfast this morning—(dinner I left mostly untasted)—I have all
      the attention I need, &amp; food &amp;c. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will write toward the middle of the week—Write whether this &amp; the money come
      safe. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Love to you, dear Mother &amp; George<sup><a href="#n0700" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; Lou<sup><a href="#n0368" id="r3">3</a></sup>—&amp; don't be uneasy about me. I have been up by the window looking out on the
      river &amp; scenery—it is beautiful weather now—they have sent over &amp; paid
      me my January pay—all are very kind—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0700">2. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n0368">3. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
