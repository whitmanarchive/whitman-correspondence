      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I received your letter yesterday morning.<sup><a href="#loc.00415_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I am extremely glad to hear that your health continues so good. Walt I have thought
      considerable of the idea that you speak of, that of your giving lectures<sup><a href="#loc.00415_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &nbsp;I fear that you would not meet with that success that you deserve. Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00415_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> and I talked about the matter and both came to the conclusion that it would be much
      better if you could be appointed dispensing agent, or something of that kind, for
      some of the numerous aid societies,<sup><a href="#loc.00415_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> and he said that he would go and see Storrs<sup><a href="#loc.00415_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> and some other of the big guns of those societies in this city and see if it could
      not be done. What do you think about it. Do you think it could be accomplished.?
   </p>
   
   <p>Everything is going along well with us at home. Mother is not troubled hardly any
      with her rheumatism and I am in hopes she will get the best of it entirely. Mattie
      is well and in first-rate spirits, she often speaks of you and says she would like
      very much to see you. Hattie is growing as nicely as it is possibly for a child to
      grow. You would love dearly to take a stroll with her now I know &nbsp;Andrew has not yet
      gone to Newbern<sup><a href="#loc.00415_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> but thinks that they will get off the fore part of the coming week. Jess and Ed are
      just the same as ever. We were all much pleased with the idea that you would come
      home to make us a visit, I do so hope that you can carry it out.<sup><a href="#loc.00415_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> do try Walt, for me &nbsp;all want to see you very much
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am glad you wrote Mother about the way in which you board for I have often and often
      thought how you was doing in that respect and I sometimes thought I ought to do something
      in the matter, precisely what or how I never could tell. I am real glad my dear Walt
      that you are among such good people. I hope it will be in the power of some of our
      family to return their Kindness some day. I'm sure twould be done with a heartfelt gratitude &nbsp;Tis pleasant, too, to think that there are still
      people of that kind left.<sup><a href="#loc.00415_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> You, of course, still continue your hospital "practice" as you might call it. I wish
      we were able to send you more money than we do but almost everyone you meet is a contributor
      to some of the aid societies and that is the way in which they are (thinking) doing
      good
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, Walt, you and I cannot agree in regard to "Uncle Abe"<sup><a href="#loc.00415_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> &nbsp;I cannot think that he is the man for the place or he would have surrounded himself
      with men that could do something. He lends himself to the speculators, in all the
      ways that it can be done. He says "yes" to the last man or "No" as that man wants
      him to. Everything he does reminds me of an old woman. I hope that the country will
      last long enough for this damned war to fall through &nbsp; It seems nothing but an immense
      bubble, only of a desperate character
   </p>
   
   <p>We have not heard from Han lately &nbsp;I wrote you that we had had a letter from George.
      I fear for George now &nbsp;I am afraid that they have sent the 51st to Vicksburgh.<sup><a href="#loc.00415_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> I do hope that George may escape but I fear not &nbsp;It seems as if he had been so lucky
      that it could not continue till the end. If you can learn anything of the 51st write
      me will you &nbsp;All send their love, good night dear brother
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00415_n1">1. Walt Whitman's letter
      of about June 11, 1863, is not extant.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00415_n2">2. In a letter to his
      mother on , Walt wrote: "I think
      something of commencing a series of lectures &amp; readings &amp;c. through
      different cities of the north, to supply myself with funds for my Hospital &amp;
      Soldiers visits—as I do not like to be beholden to the medium of others."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00415_n3">3. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00415_n4">4. On , Whitman was still firmly committed
      to this lecturing project. As he wrote Jeff, he hoped it would enable him "to
      continue my Hospital ministrations, on a more free handed scale—As to the
      Sanitary Commissions &amp; the like, I am sick of them all, &amp; would not
      accept any of their berths—you ought to see the way the men as they lie helpless
      in bed turn away their faces from the sight of these Agents." Jeff also had
      questioned the value of the Sanitary Commission (see Jeff's letter to Walt from
      ).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00415_n5">5. The Reverend Dr.
      Richard S. Storrs was a member of Brooklyn's St. Nicholas Society. Walt saved a
      section of the <em>Brooklyn Eagle</em>, December 11, 1861,
      containing a short account of Storr's lecture to this society on "A Just War—Its
      Relations to a Nations [<em>sic</em>] Highest Development"
      (Charles E. Feinburg Collection, Library of Congress).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00415_n6">6. As Jerome M. Loving
      notes, "it remains somewhat of a mystery as to why Andrew was beckoned only as
      far as Suffolk." Perhaps Andrew was to travel to Suffolk, Virginia, by boat, at
      which point James H. Cornwell, first lieutenant in the 158th New York Regiment
      of Infantry and quartermaster in charge of building fortifications at New Bern,
      North Carolina, could have met him and conducted him to New Bern by land. Andrew
      never made the trip (<em>Civil War Letters of George Washington
         Whitman</em> [Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1949], 166).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00415_n7">7. In his letter of , Walt indicated that he would try to
      return home to get "some MSS &amp; books, &amp; the trunk, &amp;c." He did not
      make the trip until November.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00415_n8">8. Because of the
      generosity of William Douglas O'Connor and his wife, Ellen, Walt had not paid
      for his meals in Washington (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:108).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00415_n9">9. See Jeff's letter to
      Walt from .<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00415_n10">10. On June 4, 1863, the
      Fifty-first New York Regiment, as part of the Ninth Corps, left Stanford,
      Kentucky, to support the Union forces near Vicksburg. They arrived about June
      15, 1863 (Loving, 97). As late as June 30 Walt suspected that George was near
      Vicksburg, but he had no certain knowledge (<em>Correspondence</em>, 1:111).<a href="#r10">[back]
