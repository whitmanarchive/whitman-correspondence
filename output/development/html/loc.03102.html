      <br></br><br></br>Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have received the copy of "Specimen Days &amp; Collect" which you were so kind as
      to send me, and I hope to have the opportunity soon of saying what I think about it
      in some English periodical. I have been deeply interested in the book, especially
      in
      so far as it supplies the 'embryons' of "Leaves of Grass", and I am especially
      gratified to receive it from yourself.
   </p>
   
   <p>My acquaintance with 'Leaves of Grass' dates from  my early university days some ten
      years ago, when having come across Rossetti's edition of selections I was induced
      soon after to get a complete edition. Since then I have never neglected them, and
      often enjoyed the effect of awakening others to perception of its great force and
      beauty, which being accompanied by so much which (justly or unjustly) excites
      prejudice, are too often overlooked. As regards the new book, which I have eagerly
      read, some of it was familiar to me already, e.g. Democratic Vistas—but
      'Specimen  Days'
      was entirely new and altogether delightful. I am inclined to think that it will
      place many readers in a better position to
      appreciate 'Leaves of Grass', than heretofore.
   </p>
   
   <p>With thanks both for this book and for former benefits received—I remain—</p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours faithfully,
      <br></br>G. C. Macaulay.
