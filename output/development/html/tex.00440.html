      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sirs
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of 21st 
      rec'd, with the curious list—I suppose of course from the
      District Attorney's office—of "suggestions" lines and pages and pieces &amp;c.
      to be "expunged." The list whole &amp; several is rejected by me, &amp; will not be
      thought of under any circumstances.<sup><a href="#upa.00204_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>To give you a definitive idea of what I meant in my notes of March 8 and March
      19—&amp; of course stick to—I mail you with this a copy of L. of G. with
      the not numerous but fully effective changes and cancellations I thought of making:
      see in it pages
      <br><br><span>84</span><br>
      <span>88</span><br>
      <span>89</span><br>
      <span>&amp; 90</span><br><br></p>
   
   <p>All those lines &amp; passages marked in pencil to come out, &amp; their places to be
      exactly filled with other matter—so that they will superficially present the
      same appearance as now.<sup><a href="#upa.00204_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> The whole thing would not
      involve an expense of more than from 5 to $10—
   </p>
   
   <p>My proposition is that we at once make the revision here indicated, &amp; go on with
      the regular issue of the book—If then any further move is made by the District
      Attorney &amp; his backers—as of course there are others behind it
      all—they will only burn their own fingers, &amp; very badly—
   </p>
   
   <p>I want the paper copy I send of L of G. returned to me when through.<sup><a href="#upa.00204_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Let this whole matter be kept quiet in the house—no talk or information
      that may lead to newspaper items—the change to be just silently
      made—the book, &amp; at casual view all its pages, to look just the
      same—only those minutely looking detecting the difference—
   </p>
   
   <p>Inform the official people at once that the cancellation is to be made for future
      editions.<sup><a href="#upa.00204_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>

   <p>Write me at once &amp; definitively if all this suits—</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00204_n1">1. The publisher submitted
      the following list of "Passages to be expurgated from Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of
      Grass,'" a list not accurately recorded by Richard Maurice Bucke in <em>Walt Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883], 149n:
      "Song of Myself" (p. 31, ll. 15-16; p. 32, ll. 19-22; p. 37, ll. 14-15; p. 48,
      ll. 20, 28, 29; p. 49, ll. 11, 20; p. 52, section 28, beginning with l. 12; p.
      59, ll. 11-12; p. 66, ll. 15-16); "From Pent-Up Aching Rivers" (p. 79, ll.
      21-22; pp. 80-81, ll. 14 to end); "I Sing the Body Electric" (p. 84, ll. 1-17;
      p. 87, ll. 13, 28); "A Woman Waits for Me" (pp. 88-89, "entire"); "Spontaneous
      Me" (pp. 90-91); "Native Moments" (p. 94, ll. 1-7); "The Dalliance of the
      Eagles" (p. 216, in entirety); "By Blue Ontario's Shore" (p. 266, ll. 21-22);
      "To a Common Prostitute" (pp. 299-300, in entirety); "Unfolded Out of the Folds"
      (p. 303, ll. 2-3); "The Sleepers" (p. 325, half of l. 22; p. 331, ll. 9-10); and
      "Faces" (p. 355, ll. 13-17). See the letter from Osgood &amp; Company to Whitman
      of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00204_n2">2. This copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> with Whitman's changes has either been
      lost or was destroyed. It will be noted that Whitman agreed to alterations only
      in "I Sing the Body Electric," "A Woman Waits for Me," and "Spontaneous Me." On
      his copy of a draft of the letter to Osgood &amp; Co. Whitman wrote: "By this
      letter of W W March 23 several minor changes &amp; alterations, words &amp;
      lines in two or three cases are consented to in '<em>Children of
         Adam</em>' but J R O. &amp; the officials not considering them as at all
      meeting the point they are entirely waived on both sides" (The Library of
      Congress; <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New
      York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 8:295).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00204_n3">3. Osgood &amp; Co. replied
      to Whitman on : "We do not think the
      official mind will be satisfied with the changes you propose. They seem to think
      it necessary that the two poems 'A Woman Waits for Me' and 'Ode to a Common
      Prostitute' should be omitted altogether. If you consent to this we think the
      matter can be arranged without any other serious changes."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00204_n4">4. This final paragraph was
      included by the executors in the letter of March 7 (<em>The
         Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>, 8:291).<a href="#r4">[back]
