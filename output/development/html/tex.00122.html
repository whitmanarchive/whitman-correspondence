   <p>I havent rec'd any letter from you yet and I begin to think you have forgoten to write but I will try once or twice more and if I dont get an answer I surely shall think something is up  I have written this makes three
      times to you and no ans yet.
   </p>
   
   <p>My health is some better than it was when I left the Hospital, but I am not well by
      a good deal and I dont know as I ever shall be able to work on a farm again  I am now in a store. I cant
      tell how long I shall stay but I think some of staying all summer  The place where
      I am in now is a pleasnt little village called Byron its a very pleasnt place. Well now how do you get along in Washington. I suppose you still go to the
      Hospital well that is all right but I havnt seen such a thing since I left Washington  Now how much do you think I could get
      a month down where you are or couldnt I get any thing  Please excuse Bad writing &amp; poor spelling and write as soon as you
      get this I am not a going to write much this time for it may never get to you if I
      get an Ans to this I will write longer next time
