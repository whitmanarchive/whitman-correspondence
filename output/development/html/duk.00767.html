   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>"After the lapse of over 8 years," William
      Stansberry, a former soldier whom Whitman had met in Armory Square Hospital,
      wrote on , from Howard Lake,
      Minn., and recalled "the Blackbery [Jam?] you gave me &amp; all the kindness
      which you shown." After Whitman replied on April 27, 1874 (lost), Stansberry
      wrote again on , about the hospital
      visits. On , he thanked Whitman for
      his letter and "22 News 
      Pappers
      
      ." On , his wife informed
      Whitman of her husband's failing health and poverty and inquired about the
      possibility of a pension. Evidently in reply to another lost letter from
      Whitman, Stansberry asked on  for
      "the Lone of 65$" in order to return to West Virginia, where he expected to find
      witnesses to support his application for a pension. This was evidently the last
      letter in the correspondence. These letters are in the Trent Collection, Duke
      University. See also <em>The Complete Writings of Walt
         Whitman</em> [New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 10 vols., 4:134.
