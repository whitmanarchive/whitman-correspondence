   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Livingston J. Brooks, a
      soldier in Co B 17th Pennsylvania Cavlary, was brought to Armory Square Hospital
      with typhoid fever. Eventually Brooks recovered and, after a furlough, returned
      to his regiment (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public
      Library). Whitman's reply of December 19 is lost (Charles I. Glicksberg, <em>Walt Whitman and the Civil War</em> [Philadelphia University
      of Pennsylvania Press, 1933], 140). Whitman noted the case in his diary (<em>Walt Whitman and the Civil War</em> [1933],
      149â€“150).
