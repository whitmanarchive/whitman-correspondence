   <p>We have had eight days of persistent obtrusive sun, glare &amp; heat —but as I
      write it is a cloudy forenoon ("for this relief much thanks") though still &amp;
      warm—I am still here in Mickle Street—at this moment sitting by the open
      window down stairs in my big arm-chair—H[erbert] G[ilchrist]<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> at work at the portrait (now near finished)—Loving
      remembrance to you all—to your father and A[lys]<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I am writing a little—not much—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
