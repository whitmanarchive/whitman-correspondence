      thinking one of my books w<u>d</u> be enough for <u>her</u>. We have invited her to come out &amp; see us when she

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4137">3. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
