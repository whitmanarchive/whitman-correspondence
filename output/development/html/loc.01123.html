      <br></br><br></br>Dear John Burroughs,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of 6th came duly,—with the plans &amp; photo., which I return herewith—John,
      the questions you ask cannot judiciously be answered, except as they involve 
      <u>the whole</u> house, ground, purposes, materials, &amp;c. &amp;c. And in reference to 
      &amp; connection with, twenty different matters besides themselves. My brother &amp; I 
      are pleased with your plan, in general—my brother favors the ground story of <u>stone</u>—but the 1 ½ superstructure of <u>wood</u>, (says it is healthier &amp; drier)—But I have no doubt at all that <u>you will cipher out the sum yourself</u>, &amp; the result will be something cosy &amp; natural.—I am not very well to-day—but am
      up &amp; have been out—am generally about the same as noted in my last.
      
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see

      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
