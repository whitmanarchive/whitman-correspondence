   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William F. Channing
      (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
      Whitman stayed at his home in October, 1868.

   <p id="n0210">2. Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
