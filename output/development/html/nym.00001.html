   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Collins "G. C." Cox
      (1851–1903) was a well-known celebrity photographer who had taken
      photographs of Whitman when the poet was in New York for a lecture. "The
      Laughing Philosopher," one of the most famous photographs of Whitman, was taken
      by Cox in 1887. It is reproduced in <em>Specimen Days</em> (1971),
      plate 174.

   <p id="nym.00001_n2">2. George Cox proposed selling
      signed copies of his photographs of Walt Whitman. However, when the September
      1887 issue of <em>Century</em> appeared with an advertisement,
      Whitman still had not seen proofs, much less signed the photographs. He wrote
      John H. Johnston on , "He
      advertises...to sell my photo, with autograph. The latter is forged, &amp; the
      former illegal &amp; unauthorized." The disagreement was quickly resolved, and
      Whitman signed photographs for Cox and returned them.<a href="#r2">[back]
