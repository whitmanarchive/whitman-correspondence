      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I feel that as my brothers friend you have been neglected but owing to sickness in
      the family having been away most of the time I have not had much spare time.<sup><a href="#nyp.00145_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup> Caleb is not quite as well as when I wrote you before. He can not sit up at all.
      He was very much pleased with your letter &amp; he wishes me to tell you to keep writing
      if you do not hear from him first. for your letters do him more good than a great
      deal of medicine. He wants to know if you will be so kind as to ask Dr. Bliss<sup><a href="#nyp.00145_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> what he must do to have his furlough extended if he should not be able to come back
      then. His head troubles him very much and I fear he will not be able to come back
      for a long time if ever through he will not own it. Hoping to hear from you again
      soon I will now close, Yours Respectfully
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00145_n100">1. As Whitman informed Mrs.
      Curtis in a , Caleb Babbitt
      suffered a sun stroke in July and was admitted to Armory Square Hospital.
      According to the "Hospital Note Book" (Henry E. Huntington Library), Babbitt had
      been in Mobile, Alabama, earlier. About August 1, 1863, he left Washington on
      furlough. On , Caleb's sister, Mary
      A. Babbitt informed Whitman of Caleb's arrival in Barre, Massachusetts; because
      of his exhaustion he was unable to write. On , at the expiration of his forty-day furlough, Caleb was
      strong enough to write: "Walt—In your letters you wish me to imagine you talking
      with me when I read them, well I do, and it does very well to think about, but
      it is nothing compared with the original." On , Babbitt was depressed—"dark clouds seem to be lying in my
      pathway and I can not remove them nor hide them from my mind"—until he mentioned
      his beloved, Nellie F. Clark, who "has saved me." On , S. H. Childs wrote for Caleb from the Massachusetts
      General Hospital, Boston: "He Is unable to set up &amp; suffers considerable
      pain In his
      head."

   <p id="nyp.00145_n2">2. D. Willard Bliss
      (1825–1889) was a surgeon with the Third Michigan Infantry, and afterward
      in charge of Armory Square Hospital. See John Homer Bliss, <em>Genealogy of the Bliss Family in America, from about the year 1550 to
         1880</em> (Boston: John Homer Bliss, 1881), 545. He practiced medicine in
      Washington after the war; see "Letter from Walt Whitman to Hiram Sholes, May 30,
      1867" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961], 1:331–332). When a pension
      for Whitman was proposed in the House of Representatives in 1887, Dr. Bliss was
      quoted: "I am of opinion that no one person who assisted in the hospitals during
      the war accomplished so much good to the soldiers and for the Government as Mr.
      Whitman" (Thomas Donaldson, <em>Walt Whitman the Man</em> [New
      York: F. P. Harper, 1896], 169).<a href="#r2">[back]
