      <br></br><br></br>My dear Poet:
      
   </p>  
   
   <p>I spent last evening in fighting for you, in reading you, and, in a feeble way,
      expounding you. I had a little company, comprising the membership of an intelligent
      reading club ignorant, however, for the most part, of your works—to whom I
      gave some account of your literary purposes, accompanied with readings from your
      works. The more melodious passages I had read by sweet-voiced women, and the robust
      passages by men with good strong voices; and some who came, perhaps, to snicker
      remained to listen with parted lips. Nevertheless, though the reading passed for a
      success, we had the stock questions to answer, and the stock objections, to
      interpose your own strong words against. One man said you had early had your head
      turned by excessive adulation! I told him that you had had at least enough of the
      other thing to bring up the balance, and that moreover, adulation would as soon turn
      the head of Moosilanke,<sup><a href="#syr.00055_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> my big mountain up north, as yours.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, all this is vain to you. Neither you nor the Leaves of Grass are on trial any
      more. But it occurred to me that you might be willing to know that reading clubs in
      Massachusetts are reading you and wrangling over you: and I desired to thank you for
      the word which you sent to us through your friend—I cannot now recall his
      name<sup><a href="#syr.00055_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—to whom Rev. Mr. DeLong<sup><a href="#n3335" id="r3">3</a></sup> wrote, and who kindly
      replied. Your cheery "God help 'em!" gave us a breath of you. My friend Baxter<sup><a href="#n6000" id="r4">4</a></sup> sent us his copy of your big book<sup><a href="#n4195" id="r5">5</a></sup> with notes, one or two, from
      you, pasted in.
   </p>
   
   <p>You do not know me, but your friends Baxter, Sloane Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r6">6</a></sup>,
      Garland<sup><a href="#loc.02128_n1" id="r7">7</a></sup> and Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#n4152" id="r8">8</a></sup> are all
      very good friends of mine, and we have for a good while celebrated you here and
      elsewhere.
   </p>
   
   <p>I send you my heartiest wishes for the prolongation of your noble life in content
      and
      in as great a measure of health as possibly can come to you.
   </p>

      Truly yours,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Joseph Edgar Chamberlin
      (1851–1935) was an American Journalist working for the <em>Boston Transcript</em> and the <em>Youth's Companion</em>. He
      wrote about Whitman for his column in the <em>Transcript</em>,
      republished in <em>Nomads and Listeners of Joseph Edgar
         Chamberlin</em> (Books for Libraries Press, 1937), 128-134.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="syr.00055_n2">1. Horace Traubel makes an
      error in transcribing Chamberlein's handwriting: the mountain is Moosilauke, in
      the White Mountains in New Hampshire.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="syr.00055_n1">2. Chamberlin is referring to
      Whitman's disciple Horace Traubel (see Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.39.html">Thursday, February 28, 1889.</a>).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n3335">3. Henry C. DeLong (1838–c.
      1916) was a unitarian minister from Medford, MA. For more on DeLong, see George
      M. Butler, "An Appreciation," <em>Medford Historical Register</em>
      19 (January 1916), 18–24.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6000">4. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4195">5. Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), a volume Whitman often referred to
      as the "big book," was published by Philadelphia publisher David McKay in
      December 1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, he made the presswork and
      binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the book, which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more information on
      the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n3039">6. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.02128_n1">7. Hamlin Garland
      (1860–1940) was an American novelist and autobiographer, known especially
      for his works about the hardships of farm life in the American Midwest. For his
      relationship to Whitman, see Thomas K. Dean, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_190.html">Garland, Hamlin</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n4152">8. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
