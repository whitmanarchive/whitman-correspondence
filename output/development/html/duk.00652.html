      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you some envelopes—they are already stamped—I send you one with Mat's address,
      &amp; one to Han, so you will 
      have them ready when you want to write. I rec'd your letter of last Wednesday—I hope
      it will work so that you can have apartments in George's new house, 
      if possible—it must be any thing but agreeable there in Atlantic street, 
      on some accounts, but there is always something—I have not been satisfied 
      with my boarding place<sup><a href="#duk.00652_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—so several weeks ago, I tried another place 
      &amp; room for a couple of days &amp; nights on trial, without giving up my old room—Well,
      I was glad enough to go back to my old place &amp; stay there—I was glad enough I hadn't
      given it up—there are some things I don't like, 
      but there are others very good indeed—it is situated in the healthiest, 
      sweetest part of Washington—two of our boarders, clerks, have left—they have lost
      their places, one in the War, and the other in the State Department—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is overcast here to-day, but warm—I enjoy it—go around in the 
      open air a great deal, &amp; take things moderate—want to see you, dear mother, 
      very much indeed, but don't think I shall leave till latter part of September—I do
      hope you are feeling quite well, &amp; not working too hard—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You say you think I like Washington so much<sup><a href="#duk.00652_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Well I am satisfied here, but not particularly attached to the place—only I think
      it is better for me as things are, &amp; better all round—if it could only be so that
      I could come home for a little while, &amp; frequently, 
      I should want nothing more—but one mustn't expect to have every thing to suit perfectly—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am feeling well as usual—Now that the awful long hot spell is over, 
      I can hardly believe I have stood it so well—&amp; you, too, mother dear, 
      seem to have got along a great deal better than I would have expected—Things are dull
      enough in Washington, but it suits me just as well—Mr. Evarts<sup><a href="#duk.00652_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> has gone home—he has a farm at Windsor, Vermont—his family lives there—he has a large
      family of children—Ashton<sup><a href="#duk.00652_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> is running the office—Love to Georgy &amp; all—Good bye, dear mother.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."
