      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Friday afternoon Jan 29 1864
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter of Tuesday night came this forenoon—the one of Sunday night I rec'd yesterday—Mother,
      you don't say in either of them whether George has re-enlisted or not—or is that not
      yet decided positively one way or the other?<sup><a href="#loc.00807_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>O Mother, how I should like to be home, (I dont want more than two or three days)—I want to see George, (I have his photograph on
      the wall, right over my table all the time)—&amp; I want to see California—you must always write in your
      letters how she is—I shall write to Han this afternoon or to-morrow morning, &amp; tell
      her probably George will come out &amp; see her, &amp; that if he does you will send her word
      beforehand—
   </p>
   
   <p>Jeff, my dear brother, if there should be the change made in the works &amp; things all overturned, you mustn't mind—I dare say you will pitch into something
      better—I believe a real overturn in the dead old beaten track of a man's life, especially
      a young man's, is always likely to turn out best, though it worries one at first dreadfully—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mat, I want to see you most sincerely—they havn't put in anything in the last two or three letters about you, but I suppose you are
      well, my dear sister—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, the young man that I took care of, Lewis Brown,<sup><a href="#loc.00807_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> is pretty well, but very restless—he is doing well now, but there is a long road
      before him yet—it is torture for him to be tied so to his cot, this weather—he is
      a very noble young man, &amp; has suffered very much—he is a Maryland boy, &amp; (like the
      southerners when they <em>are</em> union,) I think he is as strong &amp; resolute a union boy as there is in the United
      States—he went out in Maryland reg't but transferred to a N Y battery—But I find so
      many noble men in the ranks, I have ceased to wonder at it—I think the soldiers from
      the New England States &amp; the Western states are splendid, &amp; the country parts of N
      Y &amp; Pennsylvania too—I think less of the great cities than I used to—I know there
      are black sheep enough, even in the ranks, but the general rule is the soldiers are
      noble, very—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I wonder if George thinks as I do about the best way to enjoy a visit home,
      after all—When I come home again, I shall not go off gallivanting with my companions
      half as much, nor a quarter as much as I used to, but shall spend the time quietly
      home with you, while I do stay—it is a great humbug spreeing around, &amp; a few choice
      friends for a man, the real right kind, in a quiet way, are enough—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I hope you take things easy, dont you? Mother, you know I was always advising you to let things go, &amp; sit down &amp; take
      what comfort you can while you do live—
   </p>
   
   <p>It is very warm here, this afternoon it is warm enough for July—the sun burns where
      it shines on your face—it is pretty dusty in the principal streets—Congress is in
      session, I see Odell,<sup><a href="#loc.00807_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Kalbfleisch,<sup><a href="#loc.00807_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp;c. often—I have got acquainted with Mr Garfield,<sup><a href="#loc.00807_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> an M C from Ohio, &amp; like him very much indeed—(he has been a soldier west, was a
      Major General &amp; I believe a good brave one)—I don't go much to the debates this session
      yet—Congress will probably keep in session till well into the summer—as to what course
      things will take, political or military, there's no telling—I think though the secesh
      military power is getting more &amp; more shaky—how they can make any headway against
      our new, large &amp; fresh armies next season passes my wit to see—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I was talking with an (pretty high) officer, here, who is behind the scenes—I
      was mentioning that I had a great desire to be present at a first class battle—he
      told me if I would only stay around here three or four weeks longer, my wish would
      probably be gratified—I asked him what he meant, what he alluded to specifically—but he would not say any thing
      further—so I remain as much in the dark as before—only there seemed to be some meaning
      in his remark, &amp; it was made to me only as there was no one else in hearing at the
      moment—(he is quite an admirer of my poetry)—
   </p>
   
   <p>The re-enlistment of the veterans is the greatest thing yet, it pleases every body
      but the rebels—&amp; surprises every body too—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I am well &amp; fat, (I must weigh about 206)—So Washington must agree with me—I
      work three or four hours a day copying—Dear mother, I send you &amp; Hattie my love, as
      you say she is a dear little girl—Mother, try to write every week, even if only a
      few lines—love to George &amp; Jeff &amp; Mat—
