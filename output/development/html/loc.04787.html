   <p>Sunny &amp; fine to-day—had a letter f'm Jess,<sup><a href="#loc.04787_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> 
      St. Louis, this mn'g — She is well &amp; seems to be 
      getting along—is ab't 5 now, &amp; I have eaten my early 
      supper—had a fine varied meal bro't to me, but selected 
      only some stew'd tomatoes (with onions &amp; crust bread) and half 
      cup coffee, &amp; sent the rest back—am sitting here same as usual—hope &amp; pray it is comfortable
      with 
      you, sister dear—a poor English street-singing boy stops out in the street &amp; sings
      "the flowers that bloom 
      in the spring"<sup><a href="#loc.04787_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> while another boy (his brother I fancy) fiddles. $2 enclosed—God bless you Han—
