   <p>Have had such a good time with the Champagne you sent me, must at least thank [you]
      for it. I drank the whole bottle (except a little swig I insisted on Ed<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r1">1</a></sup> taking for going for it) had it in a big white mug half fill'd
      with broken ice, it has done me good already (for I was sort of "under the weather"
      the last 30 hours.)

   <p id="n4319">1. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
