   </p>
   
   <p>Just returned from a fortnight down in the Jersey woods<sup><a href="#hun.00054_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—not feeling well this month, (a bad cold, neuralgia, other head trouble,
      bowel trouble &amp;c—yet nothing serious—will blow over in a few
      days) went down for a change, had bad weather &amp; nothing
      propitious—but I have just come back &amp; am already better—shall get
      along

   <p>—So Emerson is dead<sup><a href="#hun.00054_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—the leading man in all
      Israel—If I feel able I shall go to his funeral—improbable
      though—A new deal in the fortunes of <u>Leaves of
         Grass</u>—the District Attorney at Boston has threatened Osgood with
      indictment "under the statutes against obscene literature," specifies a long list
      of
      pieces, lines &amp;c.—Osgood is frightened asks me
      
      to change &amp; expurgate—I
      refuse peremptorily—<u>he throws up the book &amp; will not
         publish it any more</u>—wants me to take the plates, 
      wh:
      
       I shall try to
      do &amp; publish it as before—(in some respects shall like it just as
      well)<sup><a href="#hun.00054_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Can you help me? Can you loan me
      $100?<sup><a href="#hun.00054_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="hun.00054_n1">1. Whitman was inaccurate:
      he was at Glendale from April 22 to 27 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). This was his "excuse" for not replying to
      Burroughs's (lost) letter of April 10.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hun.00054_n2">2. Emerson died on April 26,
      1882. On April 29 Whitman sent to <em>The Critic</em> "By
      Emerson's Grave," which appeared in the issue of May 6, along with Burroughs's
      "Emerson's Burial Day." The poet received $3 for the piece (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book). It was included in <em>Specimen Days</em> (ed.
      Floyd Stovall [New York: New York University Press, 1963],
      290–291).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hun.00054_n3">3. With his letter of , Burroughs included a communication from
      O'Connor dated April 28, in which the latter related how he had convinced
      associates in his office that the Boston censorship was "the greatest outrage of
      the century" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, ed. Sculley Bradley [New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914], 3:351).
      O'Connor wrote to Richard Maurice Bucke about the matter on April 29 (Clara
      Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New
      York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931], 212). On May 1 Burroughs wrote to Gilder,
      probably Richard, "So far as this is the wish of the city of Boston, I pray for
      the wrath of Sodom and Gomorrah to descend upon her" (Barrus, 211).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hun.00054_n4">4. In reprinting Burroughs's
      letter of , Traubel interpolated an
      explanation of the loan: "This was money in my possession belonging to Walt. J.
      B. 1912." (<em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, 3:350). Burroughs
      and Traubel, however, were in error, for on January 27, 1883, Whitman noted:
      "returned $100 to John Burroughs" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). See also Barrus,
      210.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hun.00054_n5">5. Whitman had sent the
      article to the magazine on April 8, and on April 27 received $25 "with 'sincere
      thanks'" (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r5">[back]
