      <br></br><br></br>My dear Master 
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I have to tell you that the plan of the translations from L. of G. which I am at
      work on is about completed, &amp; the actual work will be so in
      a few days. I have begun working at my translation with a German friend who is fully
      competent to help &amp; has holidays at present, which will permit him to give his whole
      time.<sup><a href="#loc.05537_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I propose to bring out the following
      poems—Starting from Paumanok—Song of Myself—The Body
      Electric—Open Road—Brooklyn Ferry—The Answerer—Passage to
      India—Faces—The Square Deific—Out of the Cradle, probably in the
      above order.<sup><a href="#loc.05537_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p> 
   
   <p>I have done  a number of the shorter poems too
      &amp; think of putting one short poem after each long one; where possible, one which
      should illustrate or illuminate something in the longer one. The whole would come
      to
      about 130 pages in the German, &amp; I would put a <u>short</u>
      preface before the poems. Rather tempted to add notes as well, to light up passages
      which cost me much mental toil to get a little clear to myself, but I shall resist
      this temptation, for I know that it is much better that readers should go through
      this toil for themselves, &amp; if they don't choose to do it, then  it is little good
      that any amount of notes would do them! Of course all the poems given will be
      rendered as faithfully &amp; completely as language permits of. I suppose I might
      say that you have authorized the translation? I shan't let my own name appear, lest
      the fact of my being a foreigner might prejudice people against the translation. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Of course if you have anything to amend or object to in the above plan I should
      alter it in accordance with your wishes. 
   </p>
   
   <p> We have glorious spring weather now—green leaves bursting out everywhere. What a
      wonderful miracle this yearly  resurrection is! 
   </p>
   
   <p> We are going home (Ireland) as soon as I have seen the L. of G. fairly
      afloat.—Autumn? Mean to live in the country where perhaps I shall try a little
      farming—literature not going to be given up either. 
   </p>
   
   <p> By the way—what sort of title would do for the book? 'Selected Poems from Walt
      Whitman's Leaves of Grass'? or better, 'Translations from W.W.'s L. of G.' Or one
      might indeed put simply 'Leaves of Grass', for your successive enlarged editions all
      bore that name, &amp; I hope that gradually this work of mine will expand till your
      whole book is fully rendered in it. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05537_n1">1. The date must be 1884, for
      in 1883 the translation had not yet progressed that far and, later in 1884,
      Rolleston informed Whitman that he had difficulties in finding a German
      publisher for his translation of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. See the
      letters from Rolleston to Whitman of 
      and of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05537_n2">2. Obviously not Karl Knortz,
      who lived in the United States and whom Rolleston had only recently approached
      by sending a copy of his own translation of "Out of the Cradle Endlessly
      Rocking"; see the letter from Rolleston to Whitman of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05537_n3">3. In the final version of
      <em>Grashalme</em>, translations of all these poems are
      included with the exception of "The Answerer," which, as "Lied des
      Antwortenden," had previously appeared in <em>Ueber Wordsworth und
         Walt Whitman</em> (Dresden: Carl Tittmann, 1883), 61–68.<a href="#r3">[back]
