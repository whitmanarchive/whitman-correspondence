   <p>Your card of 19 came this evening<sup><a href="#loc.07285_n5" id="r2">2</a></sup>. Yes, I have had all the letters you mention as
      having written including the circular letter written on scotch title-page of "Nov.
      Boughs."<sup><a href="#loc.07285_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> They have all an intense (sometimes most
      painfull) interest to me—but whether cheering or the reverse my interest in
      them and you never flags and I think never will while I am above ground—and if
      there is self-consciousness beyond the grave (as I trust there is) I expect to take
      far more interest in L. of G. there (and in all belonging to it)  than I ever did or do
      here. We shall see—at least we will not give up the ship untill we <u>have to</u>.
   </p>
   
   <p>You must be gaining—"sitting up 4½ hours &amp; getting a little
      appetite"<sup><a href="#loc.07285_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> that sounds mighty well—I hope to
      see you in pretty fair shape yet when I go East. By the way, no word from Willy
      Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r5">5</a></sup> for over a week now—think he will surely be here
      tomorrow (saturday) night, at latest—he does not seem to <u>get on</u> at all and this ever-lasting putting off and waiting is most
      wearisome—but it <u>must</u> come to an end by &amp; by. I
      never tire of looking at and looking over the big book<sup><a href="#loc.07285_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup>—it is grand

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4284">5. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
