      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir<sup xmlns=""><a href="#yal.00254_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter asking definite endorsement to a translation of my <u>Leaves of Grass</u> into Russian is just received, and I hasten to answer it.
      Most warmly and willingly I consent to the translation, and waft a prayerful <u>God speed</u> to the enterprise.
   </p>
   
   <p>You Russians and we Americans;—our countries so distant, so unlike at first
      glance—such a difference in social and political conditions, and our
      respective methods of moral and practical developement the last hundred
      years;—and yet in certain features, and vastest ones, so resembling each
      other. The variety of stock-elements and tongues to be resolutely fused in a common
      Identity and Union 
       at all
      hazards—the idea, perennial through the ages, that they both have their
      historic and divine mission—the fervent element of manly friendship throughout
      the whole people, surpassed by no other races—the grand expanse of territorial
      limits and boundaries—the unformed and nebulous state of many things, not yet
      permanently settled, but agreed on all hands to be the preparations of an infinitely
      greater future—the fact that both peoples have their independent and leading
      positions to hold, keep, and if necessary fight for, against the rest of the
      world—the deathless aspirations at the inmost centre of each great community,
      so vehement, so mysterious, so
      abysmic—are
      certainly features you Russians and we Americans possess in common.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>And as my dearest dream is for an internationality of poems and poets binding the
      lands of the earth closer than all treaties or diplomacy—As the purpose
      beneath the rest in my book is such hearty comradeship for individuals to begin
      with, and for all the Nations of the earth as a result—how happy indeed I
      shall be to get the hearing and emotional contact of the great Russian peoples!
   </p>
   
   <p>To whom, now and here, (addressing you for Russia, and empowering you, should you
      see
      fit, to put the present letter in your book, as a preface to it,) I waft
      affectionate salutation from these shores, in America's name.

      your translation—I send you a book by this mail—advise me from time
      to time—address me here—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00254_n1">1. Lee was a student at
      Trinity College, Dublin, and a friend of Thomas W. H. Rolleston. On  Lee wrote to Whitman requesting
      permission to translate Leaves of Grass into Russian (see <em>Whitman and Rolleston—A Correspondence</em>, ed. Horst Frenz
      [Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1951], 48–50). Nothing
      came of Lee's projected translation.<a href="#r1">[back]
