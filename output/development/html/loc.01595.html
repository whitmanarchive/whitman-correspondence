      <br></br><br></br>Dear Jack,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you a few lines, though there is nothing new or special with me. 
      I am still working here in the same place, and expect to be here all winter—(yet there
      is such a thing as a man's slipping up in his calculations, you know.) 
      My health keeps good, &amp; work easy. I often think of you, my loving boy, 
      and think whether you are all right &amp; in good health, &amp; working on 2d avenue yet.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you received the letter I sent you. I got yours November 15, 
      &amp; sent you a letter about the 20th or 21st<sup><a href="#loc.01595_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> I believe. I have not heard from you since.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Congress began here last Monday. I have been up to see them in session. The halls
      they meet in are magnificent. 
      The light comes all from the roof. The new part of the Capitol is very fine indeed.<sup><a href="#loc.01595_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> 
      It is a great curiosity to any one that likes fine workmanship both in wood &amp; stone.
      
      But I hope you will come here &amp; see me, as you talked of<sup><a href="#loc.01595_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Whether we are indeed to have the chance 
      in future to be much together &amp; enjoy each other's love &amp; friendship<sup><a href="#loc.01595_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup>—or whether worldly affairs are to separate us—I don't know. But somehow I feel (if
      I am not dreaming) 
      that the good square love is in our hearts, for each other, while life lasts.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I told you in my previous letter, this city is quite small potatoes after living
      in New York. 
      The public buildings are large &amp; grand. Most of them are made of white marble, &amp; on
      a far grander scale 
      than the N. Y. City Hall; but the oceans of life &amp; people, such as in N. Y. &amp; the
      shipping &amp;c, 
      are lacking here. Still a young man ought to see Washington once in his life, any
      how. 
      Then I please myself with thinking it will be a pleasure to you to be with me. 
      Jack, I want you to write to me often as you can.
      
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Flood was a streetcar conductor in New York,
      known, according to an unidentified notation on his letter to Walt Whitman, as
      "Broadway Jack." According to date entries in an address book (the Library of
      Congress # 109), Whitman saw Flood on September 30, 1868, and October 5, 1868,
      and rode with him on his Second Avenue car. Flood had been a conductor for ten
      years. After Whitman's return to Washington, there was a brief correspondence,
      consisting of four extant letters from Whitman (dated , ,
      , and ) and one from the young man. Flood wrote on : "Sir, It is with great pleasure
      that I sit down with pen in hand to address a few lines to you." He informed
      Walt Whitman that he had lost his position on New Year's Eve and that he was now
      seeking another job: "I shall still continue to correspond and can never forget
      your kind friendship towards me. ... Your True and Ever intimate friend."
      According to the first listing of his name in the New York Directory, in
      1872–1873, he was at that time either in the milk business or a
      milkman.
