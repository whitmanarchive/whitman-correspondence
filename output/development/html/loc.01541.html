   <p>We are having a very cold spell here, the severest of the winter—freezes up the pipes

      &amp; burst them yesterday, causing great trouble—I too have got a bad cold, my head all

      full as well as usual—I am having quiet good times home here, with Mother—stay in the house 
      more than usual, on account of the bitter cold, (but go out two or three hours during
      the day)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will only write this very short letter to you this time, but send you my love, my
      darling son—I think about you every day dear son—will write more, soon—here is a kiss
      for you dear loving son.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
