   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="sta.00004_n1">1. Whitman noted receipt of
      $50.12 from Carpenter on this date (<em>The Commonplace Book</em>,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Carpenter sent a letter on  and a post card on September 20 about
      the book orders from his friends (<em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, ed. Horace Traubel [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania
      Press, 1905–1953], 4:204–205). See also Whitman's letter to Edward
      Carpenter of ). At Whitman's

      English poet, and had found her verse commonplace.<a href="#r1">[back]
