      <br></br><br></br>Dear Son,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am sitting here in my room, having just eat a hearty dinner with my mammy<sup><a href="#n0705" id="r2">2</a></sup>, (who has this
      month entered on her 76th year,<sup><a href="#loc.01534_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> but to my eyes looks young &amp;
      handsome yet.) It is a dark &amp; cloudy day, &amp; the rain is just now pouring down in
      torrents. It is a great disappointment to many, as Farragut's funeral celebration<sup><a href="#loc.01534_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> was to come off to–day, &amp; all the military, &amp;
      Departments here, &amp; hundreds of societies, orders, schools &amp;c. had prepared to turn
      out—&amp; most of them did turn out, this forenoon, only to get soaked with rain,
      &amp; covered with mud—I saw one crack battalion, all so spruce &amp; handsome, with
      white pants, &amp; silver gray coats, &amp; every thing so bright &amp; trim when they
      marched down—&amp; an hour &amp; a half afterwards, they looked like draggled roosters
      that had been pumped on—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have had weeks and weeks of the very finest weather up to early this morning, &amp;
      now
      it is the worst kind to be out in. Still we want rain so very much, one 
      dont
      
       feel to complain. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, I rec'd your last letter, the 26th—it was a good long, lively letter, &amp;
      welcome—you write about the Signal Corps<sup><a href="#n0561" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Allen<sup><a href="#loc.01534_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> deserves credit for persevering &amp; studying—&amp; I hope
      he will do well—&amp; think he will too—for he is sober, &amp; tries to get
      ahead—any how he is a young man I like—Thornett<sup><a href="#loc.01534_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup> is a
      very intelligent manly fellow, cute, plucky, &amp;c—he has one fault, &amp; a bad
      one—that is he will drink, &amp; spree it—which spoils all—True it is none
      of my business, but I feel that it would be perhaps the making of him, if he would
      give it
      up, &amp; find his pleasure in some other way—Pete, should you see Allen again, give
      him my love—&amp; the same for Thornett also—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Did you mean for me to write what I think of your joining the Signal Corps? But are
      you
      proficient enough in studies? I heartily advise you to peg away at the arithmetic—do
      something at it every day—arithmetic is the foundation of all such things—(just
      as a good stone wall is the foundation for a house)—become a good arithmetician first
      of all—&amp; <em>you surely will, if you keep pegging away a little
         every day</em>—how much leisure you have after all, that might be used for
      study—I don't mean all your leisure, but say one hour out of every three—then
      keep looking over the geography—when I come back I will bring a little pocket
      dictionary—with 15 minutes writing every day, &amp; correcting by the dictionary I
      would warrant you becoming a correct speller &amp; real handsome writer in a year or
      less—&amp; when one is a fair arithmetician &amp; spells &amp; writes finely, so many
      things are open to him. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As things stand at present I expect to be back by or before next Sunday.<sup><a href="#loc.01534_n6" id="r8">8</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01534_n1">1. Walt Whitman intended to write "Sept. 30,"
      which was Friday, the day of Farragut's funeral as described below.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0705">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01534_n2">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman was born
      September 22, 1795.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01534_n3">4. The burial rites of Admiral David Glasgow
      Farragut (1801–1870) were held in New York on September 30, 1870. All
      business activity was suspended, and the ceremonies, according to the New York
      <em>Times</em>, "surpassed in their imposing character
      anything of the kind ever seen in this City, with the exception of the obsequies
      of the murdered President Lincoln."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0561">5. The Army Signal Corps manages information systems
      for the armed forces. It was established in 1860.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01534_n4">6. Perhaps George Allen, mentioned in
      Whitman's  letter to Doyle.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01534_n5">7. Alfred Thornett, like Doyle, was a
      conductor; see Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of
      Congress, Notebook #109. Evidently he later entered the Signal Corps, since in
      another address book (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The
      Library of Congress, Notebook #108) Walt Whitman gave his address as "Obs. Sig.
      Serv. U. S. A., Mt. Washington, N. H."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01534_n6">8. Walt Whitman later altered his plans; in
      his  letter to William D.
      O'Connor, Whitman noted that he would not return to Washington until October 15,
      1870.<a href="#r8">[back]
