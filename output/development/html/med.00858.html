   <p>Briefly to answer impromptu your request of Oct: 19<sup><a href="#med.00858_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—the question whether I think any American poet not now living deserves a
      place among the thirteen "English inheritors of unassail'd renown" (Chaucer<sup><a href="#med.00858_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>,
      Spenser<sup><a href="#med.00858_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>, Shakspeare<sup><a href="#med.00858_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>, 
      Milton<sup><a href="#med.00858_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>, Dryden<sup><a href="#med.00858_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>, 
      Pope<sup><a href="#med.00858_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>, Gray<sup><a href="#med.00858_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>, 
      Burns<sup><a href="#med.00858_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>, Wordsworth<sup><a href="#med.00858_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup>, 
      Coleridge<sup><a href="#med.00858_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup>, Byron<sup><a href="#med.00858_n12" id="r12">12</a></sup>, 
      Shelley<sup><a href="#med.00858_n13" id="r13">13</a></sup> and Keats<sup><a href="#med.00858_n14" id="r14">14</a></sup>,)—and
      which American poets would be truly worthy,
      &amp;c. Though to me the deep of the matter goes down, down beneath. I remember the
      London Times at the time, in opportune, profound and friendly articles on Bryant's<sup><a href="#med.00858_n15" id="r15">15</a></sup>
      and Longfellow's<sup><a href="#med.00858_n18" id="r16">16</a></sup> deaths, spoke of the embarrassment, warping effect, and confusion
      on America (her poets and poetic students) "coming in possession of a great estate
      they had never lifted a hand to form or earn"; and the further contingency of "the
      English language ever having annex'd to it a lot of first-class Poetry that would
      be
      American, not European"—proving then something precious over all, and beyond
      valuation. But perhaps that is venturing outside the question. Of the thirteen
      British immortals mention'd—after placing Shakspeare on a sort of pre-eminence
      of fame not to be invaded yet—the names of Bryant, Emerson<sup><a href="#med.00858_n16" id="r17">17</a></sup>, 
      Whittier<sup><a href="#med.00858_n17" id="r18">18</a></sup> and
      Longfellow (with even added names, sometimes Southerners, sometimes Western or other
      writers of only one or two pieces,) deserve in my opinion an equally high niche of
      renown as belongs to any on the dozen of that glorious list.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The editor of the <em>Critic</em> in this year was Jeannette Gilder (1849–1916), who wrote
      that "one of the things of which I am most proud is that the <em>Critic</em> was the first publication of its class to invite Walt Whitman
      to contribute to its pages" (see Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt
         Whitman as Man, Poet, and Friend</em> [1915], 97); she was assisted in her
      editorial tasks by her brother Joseph. For more, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_94.html">Gilder, Jeannette L. (1849–1916)</a>," <em>Walt
