   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well I am still here Pete, kept in pretty close quarters by the weather—but it seems
      to be something 
      of a let up this morning—There is nothing special to write about—but I thought I would
      send you 
      a line this morning. I sent you a letter two days ago with $10—(the second 10 I have
      sent)
      Write me whether you rec'd it all right. I hope you are not discouraged by the way things work 
      on the road—It wont be very long, now before I shall be back with you—Give my love to 
      Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nash—tell Wash Milburne I wish him success in the "graduate of Pharmacy"
      line, 
      &amp; every thing else—<u>give him my love</u>—
   </p>

      Pete, I believe that is all this time, dear baby,
      <br></br>Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>with a kiss from your loving father—</p>

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
