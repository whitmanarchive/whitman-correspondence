   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00163_n100">1. Charles H. Harris enlisted
      as a private in Company F, 4th Vermont Infantry, at Brattleboro on 21 Sep 1861
      and reenlisted on 12 December 1863. At the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864,
      the 4th Vermont sustained extraordinary losses; nearly half of the regiment of
      550 men were killed or wounded. Harris was among those wounded and was sent to
      Armory Square Hospital. In his notebook, Whitman recorded Harris's arrival:
      "Charley H Harris co F. 4th Vermont bed 35—ward A May 13 '64" (Edward F. Grier,
      <em>Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</em>, [New
      York, New York University Press: 1984], 2:729). Harris was finally discharged
      for his wounds on 31 December 1864.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00163_n2">2. Garaphelia ("Garry") Howard
      was one of Whitman's Washington friends. In a February 11, 1874 letter to Ellen
      O'Connor, Whitman describes Howard as "a good, tender girl—true as steel" (Edwin
      Haviland Miller, [New York: New York University Press, 1961],
      2:275–277).<a href="#r2">[back]
