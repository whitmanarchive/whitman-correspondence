      My dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The package of "Reports"<sup><a href="#nyp.00136_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and afterwards your letter were received—I intended before this to write you and
      return thanks for the same—but like many other of my "good intentions," I failed in
      it. &nbsp;I am under great obligations to you for the Reports—they furnished me with just
      the information I needed and you will please receive my most sincere thanks
   </p>
   
   <p>In your letter you spoke of trying to get me some other reports of a like nature &nbsp;I
      am very greedy to get these things and shall probably show it in my letters. &nbsp;Anything
      you can send me in the Report line will be of great use and a great favor to me
   </p>
   
   <p>Matters are going about as usual with me—the works are progressing slowly—but we are
      doing pretty good work &nbsp;I wish you might be able to pay us a visit—I would take great
      pleasure in showing you what we are doing, and telling what we intend to do.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hav'nt heard from Walt for a long time, although I have written him several times. &nbsp;I hope
      he is well and that the change of "government" will not hurt either you or him
   </p>
   
   <p>I remember with a great deal of pleasure my visit to Washington<sup><a href="#nyp.00136_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> and hope that during the coming season I shall be enabled to see you all again—if
      I get East during the summer I certainly shall manage to get around to see you all
   </p>
   
   <p>I have again commenced keeping house—my wife was not so well boarding as when we are
      keeping house. &nbsp;I think I have a good dry house this time<sup><a href="#nyp.00136_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—and quite convenient too—for a St. Louis house
   </p>
   
   <p>My wife is better than she was in Brooklyn but not as well as when we first came back
      from the east. &nbsp;I hope she will get better now that she is so fixed that she can have
      better food than when boarding &nbsp;The children are as well as ever—
   </p>
   
   <p>Please remember me to your wife and family—I hope they are well—and when you see Walt
      tell him we are all as usual—I remain yours very truly
   </p>

      had evidently moved into 934 Hickory, where they lived until 1873. &nbsp;Joseph P.
      Davis boarded with them until he left around March 1870 to build the waterworks
      in Lowell, Massachusetts (Waldron, p. 68).<a href="#r4">[back]
