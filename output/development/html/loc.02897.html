   <p> The birth of the baby occurred in Fitchburg where Mrs Kennedy has been, at her
      aunt's, for a month. The child will have to be with relatives, I fear, for a year
      or
      so, until I get a settled position.<sup><a href="#loc.02897_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> You were partially right in thinking me
      connected with a large printing establishment. I <u>do</u> do
      proof-reading for such at times, but have no 
      reg.
      
       position. I had a $100. job this winter, reading Greek &amp; Hebrew proofs.
      But my chief reliance is on my pen at present. I am pulling every rope to get into
      the custom house. In the mean time, calmly, toilingly, ohne hast, ohne rast, working
      away on my literary chef-d-oeuvre, "Whitman, the Poet of Humanity,"—here in my
      idyllic, noiseless home-cottage. Wish I

       send you some of the pinks, accept my love instead in return for yours,
      as something more precious. You renovate &amp; <u>cheerify</u> my
      ethical nature every time I visit you.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
