      Transcript.<br><br>
      William Conant Church and Francis Pharcellus Church, editors of the <em>Galaxy</em>, printed several of Whitman's poems beginning
      in 1867. The first notice of Walt Whitman to appear in the magazine was <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00061.html">John Burroughs' 1866 review</a> of <em>Drum-Taps</em>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00415_n2">2. Apparently the Churches
      rejected "The Mystic Trumpeter," which appeared in the <em>Kansas
         Magazine</em> in ; Whitman wrote of his relationship with the magazine in
      his  letter to Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
