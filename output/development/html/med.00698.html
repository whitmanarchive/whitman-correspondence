   <p>S. was away when your picture came,<sup><a href="#med.00698_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> attending his sick brother, Charles—who has since died—an event that has sadden'd me much. Charlie was younger than S., and a most attractive young fellow. He work'd at my father's, and had done so for two years. He was about the best specimen of
      a young country farm-hand I ever knew. You would have loved him. He was like one of
      your poems. With his great strength, his blond hair, his cheerfulness and contentment,
      his universal good will, and his silent manly ways, he was a youth hard to match.
      He was murder'd by an old doctor. He had typhoid fever, and the old fool bled him twice. He lived
      to wear out the fever, but had not strength to rally. He was out of his head nearly
      all the time. In the morning, as he died in the afternoon, S. was standing over him,
      when Charlie put up his arms around S.'s neck, and pull'd his face down and kiss'd him. S. said he knew then the end was near. (S. stuck to him day and night to the
      last.) When I was home in August, Charlie was cradling on the hill, and it was a picture
      to see him walk through the grain. All work seem'd play to him. He had no vices, any more than Nature has, and was belov'd by all who knew him.

   <p>I have written thus to you about him, for such young men belong to you; he was of
      your kind. I wish you could have known him. He had the sweetness of a child, and the
      strength and courage and readiness of a young Viking. His mother and father are poor;
      they have a rough, hard farm. His mother works in the field with her husband when
      the work presses. She has had twelve children.
