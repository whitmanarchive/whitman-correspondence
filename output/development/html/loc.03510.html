      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I wish to thank you most heartily for your gift to me which I have just received
      from Mrs Wharton.<sup><a href="#loc.03510_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> 
   </p>
   
   <p> I could not have received anything from America which I should prize as I do this
      Volume of the Leaves of Grass. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Since I first read your poems years ago now they have always had a great influence
      on my thoughts and wishes. I should have liked to  write to you then, but I did not
      think I had a right to, and I wished to see you and talk to you, but I never had
      the opportunity. Your gift has given me at least the right to thank you now not only
      for it but for the great good I have got form your work. Every man I suppose worries
      out some idea of the right life for himself, but your books have helped me much in
      getting a truer view of things than I started with. I have found out the truth of
      your words too from my short  experience of life in deed as well as in thought. You have many
      more worthy listeners but none more gratified than myself. Your Leaves of Grass I
      keep with my Shakespeare and my Bible and it is from these three that I have got
      more sympathy than from any other books. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I should like to tell you too that you have many more friends here than you can ever
      have heard of by letter or paper, men and women who have got a good hold of your
      poems and their pith. 
   </p>
   
   <p> If you should ever come to the Old  Country how pleased we should be, I wish it may yet be possible
      for you to do so. 
   </p>
   
   <p> You will not I hope think that I wish to give you the trouble of sending or writing
      any answer to these few lines. I have not written for that at all, but simply
      because I wanted you to know that I am very grateful to you and that I am yours
      faithfully 
   </p>
