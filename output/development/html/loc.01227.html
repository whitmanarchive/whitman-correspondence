      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman:—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have thought of you often since my call upon you the other day (and before, too,
      for that matter), and felt, that although I have a copy of your works in my library,
      I would like one from <u>you</u> Enclosed find ten dollars for
      one (never mind the change). Please mail it to above address. Give me your "hand
      write" in it if convenient.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In talking with the present Editor of the Brooklyn <u>Eagle</u>,
      the other evening, I learned that you used to be the Editor of that paper. They will
      have a jubilee soon on the occasion of some anniversary, and, I hope, will
      acknowledge their obligations to you for giving them a good lift in days agone.
   </p>
   
   <p>With kind regards and love—</p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours sincerely,
      <br></br>Will Carleton
