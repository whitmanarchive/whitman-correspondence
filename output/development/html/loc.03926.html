   </p>
   
   <p> I send you three pounds ￡3. [
      <span class="unclear">the?</span>]
      
      sum being Miss R.E. Powell's<sup><a href="#loc.03926_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> (Piccard's Rough, St Catherine's Guildford) annual
      subscription to the Free-Will-offering—sent to Mr. Rossetti in form of a cheque, but
      he sent it on to me
      to post to you; I should be very glad to see these <u>annual</u> subscriptions increase. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I wonder who wrote the long articles about you in the <u>Pall Mall Gazette</u>?<sup><a href="#loc.03926_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I have had a good
      amicable letter from Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r3">3</a></sup>—what a thoroughly good-natured chap
      he is! 
   </p>
   
   
   <p> It is foggy with us; too foggy to paint! though I and Grace<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r4">4</a></sup> had a little skating on
      the <u>'Club Pond'</u> this morning. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I am getting [
      <span class="unclear">ready?</span>]
       my pictures (2) for the spring Exhibition. 
   </p>
   
   <p> My Book is getting [
      <span class="unclear">near?</span>]
       though not quite through the press: In one of the last
      chapters, I added, at the last minute, &amp;, to 
      speak, some gossips or "cracks", as the Scotch say, this I exchanged with
      you down at the <u>Creek</u> under the Walnut tree: when you are writing
      again, tell me how Mrs. Stafford<sup><a href="#n0817" id="r5">5</a></sup> is will you Walt?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03926_n1">1. Miss R. E. Powell of
      Guildford, England, was apparently a friend of the Gilchrists.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03926_n2">2. He is probably referring to
      the opinion-piece that was published in the column "Occasional Notes" on
      December 16, 1886.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0890">4. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0817">5. Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).<a href="#r5">[back]
