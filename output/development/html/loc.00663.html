      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Brother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I want to thank
      you again for your
      kindness,â€”your kind
      remembrance of me. Christmas did
      me good, for at times
      I feel very friendless
      I only wish I could do
      something for you.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Walt dear I think
      too much of you to annoy
      you in any way. I think
      so much about home such
      a wish for you to get
      quite well. I should <u>never</u>
      forgive myself, it would
      be the worst trouble I ever
      had, if I said annything
      to hurt you in the least
      speaking or complaining
      
      don't mend things, and I
      write so seldom. I should
      at least write a cheerfull
      letter, but Charlie has just
      come home from down town
      says he has been writing
      to you (perhaps he has not
      I dont know whether to believe
      him or not) I am so
      uneasy I dont know what
      to do. I am so afraid he
      has said something that
      will worry you dear brother
      I know he does write fearful
      letters, every word the most
      untrue and unjust &amp; he's written a great many for
      I have opened and read them.
      I only want you to know that
      he cannot or does not say
      <u>one word of truth</u> ever or
      at any time, when he
      speaks of me. I know
      
      he writes to his sisters &amp; others
      very badly of me indeed, and have
      been told that he talks
      ill of me to any one and
      everyone that will listen.
      (he to day received a New Years
      present a box of hankerchiefs from
      his sister &amp; niece, &amp; letter of great
      sympathy for him in his
      unhappy home. they think
      it might do him good to come
      to them &amp;c, two hankerchiefs
      were for me, they are nice,
      but I cant appreciate them
      as I would, if they knew
      me as I am.)
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Dearest Brother I want
      you to know that I write
      to day feeling very unhappy
      and anxious, for fear Charlie
      has written something disagreable, if he has written &amp; you
      will mind it, you would
      understand why if you had
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear Brother in my hurry I made 
      a mistake, thought this was written on
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I hope with my whole heart that
      I have not said anything to make
      you feel bad for a moment, <u>you must not</u>
      that I could not endure. Generally I get along
      well as most persons, to day I am worried and
      excited, probably if I [
      <span class="unclear">waited?</span>]
       till to morrow
      I should write differently. Next time dear
      brother I will write cheerfully, may be when you
      get this I will feel happy again. I have thought
      often if I should die [
      <span class="unclear">someday?</span>]
      , I should not like Charlie to say I
      was crazy. (I am likely to live as he) &amp; you not know his way
      I used to be too sensitive to speak, but lately so many have
      spoken to me of it. its too absurd to mind I know
      
      I do mind it. I have some comforts. I think a
      great deal of my home with all my troubles
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I have only spoke of myself &amp; could not help it today
      
   </p>
