   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>"Little Mitch," or Reuben Farwell (1843â€“1926),
      served with the Michigan Cavalry during the War and met Walt Whitman in Armory
      Square Hospital early in 1864; upon his release from the hospital he
      corresponded with Whitman. After Farwell received his discharge on August 24,
      1864, he returned to his home in Plymouth, Mich. Evidently the correspondence
      was renewed when Walt Whitman sent a post card (now lost) on February 5, 1875.
      On , Farwell, who owned a farm in
      Michigan, wrote: "Walt my dear old Friend how I would like to grasp your hand
      and give you a kiss as I did in the days of yore. what a satisfaction it would
      be to me." In Farwell's last letter, on , he said that he was planning to leave shortly for California.
      Eleven letters from Farwell are in the Trent Collection, Duke University. He is
      mentioned in "Memoranda During the War"; see <em>The Complete
         Writings of Walt Whitman</em> (1902), 10 vols., IV, 134.
