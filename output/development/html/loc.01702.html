   <p>Not knowing whether it will reach you, I will however write a line to acknowledge
      the
      receipt of your beautiful &amp; elevated "Love &amp; Death," and of the friendly letter from
      you, of October 7th last.<sup><a href="#loc.01702_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I have read &amp; re-read the poem,
      &amp; consider it of the loftiest, strongest &amp; tenderest.<sup><a href="#loc.01702_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      Your letter was most welcome to me. I should like to know you better, &amp; I wish you
      to
      send me word should this reach you—if the address is the right one. I wish to forward
      you a copy of my book—as I shall presently bring out a new edition. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am, as usual, in good health, and continue to work here in Washington in a government
      office, finding it not unpleasant—finding, in it, indeed sufficient and free
      margin.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pray 
      dont
      
       think hard of me for not writing more promptly. I have thought of you more than
      once, &amp; am deeply touched with your poem.<sup><a href="#loc.01702_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01702_n1">1. This draft letter is endorsed, "letter to
      J. A. Symonds, went Jan 27, 1872."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01702_n2">2. (1840–1893), author of <em>Renaissance in Italy</em> (1875–1886) and <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets, and a minor poet.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01702_n3">3. On the title page of <em>Love and Death</em> appeared: "To the Prophet Poet | Of Democracy Religion
      Love | This Verse | A Feeble Echo of His Song | Is Dedicated." Symonds noted in
      his letter of  that his poem "is of
      course implicit already in your Calamus, especially in 'Scented herbage of my
      breast.'" The printer's proof of the poem is in the Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C. On December 8, 1872, Symonds wrote to Swinburne, somewhat
      abjectly, to implore his opinion of his poems: "I sent Walt Whitman the one
      called 'Love &amp; Death,' &amp; he graciously accepted it as a tribute to the
      author of Calamus. Yet no one on whose critical faculty I could rely has judged
      them" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01702_n4">4. Walt Whitman deleted: "I must apologize,
      &amp; profoundly too, for not having written to you before."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01702_n5">5. Encouraged by Walt Whitman's reply,
      Symonds wrote on , begging for
      clarification of "athletic friendship." On , he sent Walt Whitman "Callicsates," a poem which, like
      Stoddard's sketches, has homosexual overtones. Perhaps because Symonds pressed
      too hard, as he was to do again later, for information about the Calamus poems,
      Walt Whitman did not reply; see Symonds' letter of .<a href="#r5">[back]
