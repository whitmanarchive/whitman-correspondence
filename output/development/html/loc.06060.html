      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have your card of 17th<sup><a href="#loc.00758_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Have also had a letter from Mrs
      O'Connor<sup><a href="#n4305" id="r3">3</a></sup> telling me about O'C.'s<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      exodus to the west. I have just written to her and to O'C. It seems O'C.'s doctors
      are at present telling Mrs O'C. that the disease is <u>now</u>
      sclerosis the disease has been Sclerosis <u>all along</u> and how
      the doctors could have thought otherwise (if they <u>did</u> so
      think) I cannot imagine. It is pitiable to see the poor fellow at this late hour
      going for "change of air" as if that could by any possibility do any good in such
      a
      case. However it won't do any harm and the change may rouse him up a little for the
      time. He may go on living for months (even quite a few years) yet and the great
      thing of course is to save him all the suffering (mental &amp; bodily) possible. All quiet
      here—Country all grown solid again—splendid wheeling smooth hard
      roads—cloudy weather—All well here we have just had a good
      dinner—roast turkey, bread sauce &amp; apple pie—What more could one ask
      for? We are all looking forward to seeing you here by &amp; by—if the
      lecture<sup><a href="#loc.06060_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> comes off Mrs B.<sup><a href="#loc.06060_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      will go with me to New York after you and surely we can bring you home comfortably
      between us—I have just written to Johnston<sup><a href="#loc.06060_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup> too
      about the lecture we want to find out what they are thinking about in New York I
      guess it will be all right—they surely will not let the chance go by after
      Phila<sup><a href="#loc.06060_n6" id="r8">8</a></sup> letting them send a good example last
      year—I wonder when they are going to mind your hospital article in the
      Century?<sup><a href="#loc.06060_n3" id="r9">9</a></sup></p>

      Goodbye—we all send love to you

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.06060_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: London | AM | Fe[illegible]
      2[illegible] | 87 | Canada; [illegible] | [illegible] | 22 | 2 PM | 1887 | Rec'd. The verso to this
      envelope is stamped: Insane Asylum London Ontario.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00758_n2">2. This letter is evidently
      lost.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4305">3. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor. Walt may have mentioned a potential visit by Nelly
      and her daughter during his May visit to Brooklyn, though whether a visit came
      near this time is not known from his or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters.
      Walt Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington years,
      and he spoke often in his letters of their daughter Jean (called "Jenny" or
      "Jeannie"). Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off
      their friendship in late 1872 over a disagreement about Reconstruction policies
      and the role of emancipated slaves, Nelly would remain friendly with
      Whitman.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">4. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.06060_n4">5. This is referring to
      Whitman's Lincoln lecture, which he would deliver in New York on April 15, 1887.
      The lecture was a tremendous success, and Whitman was so showered with adulation
      that he observed in the Commonplace Book: "If I had staid longer, I sh'd have
      been killed with kindness &amp; compliments" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.06060_n2">6. Likely a reference to Jessie
      Gurd Bucke (1839–1926), Richard Maurice Bucke's wife.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.06060_n5">7. John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.06060_n6">8. Whitman had delivered his Lincoln lecture in
      Philadelphia at the Chestnut Street Opera House on April 15, 1886.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.06060_n3">9. "Army Hospitals and Cases:
      Memoranda at the Time, 1863–66" was printed in <em>The
         Century</em> in October of 1888. It was later reprinted in Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em>.<a href="#r9">[back]
