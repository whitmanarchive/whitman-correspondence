      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just heard from Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r2">2</a></sup> that your illness continues. We
      had been hoping that the recovery would be more lasting and that the summer days
      would see you driving out and enjoying the precious sunshine. We had also been
      looking forward to the pleasure of feeling that you were comfortably domiciled in
      the desired cottage of your own, away from the stifling and noisy city, but your
      friends who worked to that and will all feel—as one  of them has expressed it — that the
      thought that the project has given you even the briefest joy, and that it has given
      you the gratification of building and dwelling therein in the world of your mind—more
      real than the world of sense—fully 
      compensates them.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am so glad that you have to help you so devoted a friend as young Traubel,<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r3">3</a></sup> and through you I give him my hand and my thanks.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have lately been reading a beautiful and noble story by Edward Bellamy,<sup><a href="#n4272" id="r4">4</a></sup> "Looking Backward." It goes far in the direction pointed out by
      your prophetic "Democratic Vistas," and I hope Traubel will read it and tell you
      about it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In these days the glorious words you have spoken about Death comes up in my mind,
      and
      I feel much as must have been felt by the disciples in those calm last hours of
      Socrates. Whether his coming be near at hand, or later, he can only take your
      physical presence from us and that which you have given will ever abide with us. To
      many whose souls you know will be realized by your words:
   </p>
   
   <p>"I spring from the pages into your arms—decease calls me forth."<sup><a href="#loc.07103_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked:

   <p id="n3039">2. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
