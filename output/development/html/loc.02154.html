   <p>Your good words (Jan 27–Feb 13) just 
      rec'd. Of course does me good to hear from you—(that anecdote of Lady
      Dilke too pleased me)<sup><a href="#loc.02154_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Every thing goes on pretty much the same with us here in Camden—my sister quite
      up to her standard of health—not <em>plus</em>, but not <em>minus</em> either—my brother a little on the plethoric,
      &amp; a little more <em>minus</em> than is desirable, but goes forth
      as usual every day—is building a house for their own occupancy on the little
      farm at Burlington—
   </p>
   
   <p>I go out quite a good deal as guest to a charming Quaker
      family, R Pearsall Smith &amp; Mrs Smith at Germantown—a son &amp; two fine
      daughters—dear friends all—have fine drives—the elder daughter,
      20, is a great reader of L of G.<sup><a href="#loc.02154_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>My books doing—L. of G. sales have been good—<em>Specimen
         Days</em> not so good yet, but I am satisfied. (Wilson<sup><a href="#loc.02154_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; McCormick, St. Vincent St. Glasgow, are publishing S D for the British
      market)—Dr Bucke's book is in the hands of the printers here (Phila) &amp; is
      to be published by David McKay, 23 South 9th St. Phila. Will be out in three or four
      weeks. The Vols. of <em>Carlyle's and Emerson's Letters</em> are out
      here (Boston)—I have just glanced at them<sup><a href="#loc.02154_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I
      suppose you 
      recd
      
       "the Bible as Poetry" in the "Critic"—
   </p>
   
   <p>I don't know where I shall flit to the coming summer—if I am well
      enough—Even as I write I receive a letter from John Burroughs, &amp; will just
      enclose it—dont
      
       want it again—(not as promising as I could wish)—if you can
      lay hands on the last <em>Century</em> (March) read J. B's
      piece—I think very fine—best love to you—&amp; to dear Herb, and
      dear Giddy—The Staffords are all well—I 
      havn't
      
       been down there in some months, but am going.<sup><a href="#loc.02154_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>

      handled a betrayer of a maid (<em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist
         and Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Thomas B. Harned [New York: Doubleday, Page &amp;
      Company, 1918], 211–212).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.02154_n4">4. Fred W. Wilson of this
      firm wrote to Whitman on February 27, 1884: "You may be pleased to know that
      your <em>Leaves of Grass</em> is going very well here. I have been
      a reader of your writings for the last ten years or so and have in my humble way
      done my best to spread a knowledge of your work. (Indeed I have evinced the
      sincerity of my belief in you by going farther in its expression than most
      people have thought <em>prudent</em> in me—viz: by becoming
      your publisher in this country. Not in the slightest degree do I regret taking
      this step for I look upon you as one of my teachers and as such owe you my debt
      of gratitude)" (The Library of Congress, Washington D.C.).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.02154_n6">6. Apparently Whitman did
      not visit the Staffords from November 27, 1882, to April 14, 1883. Harry
      Stafford called on the poet on March 5 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r6">[back]
