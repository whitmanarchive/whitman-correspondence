      <br></br><br></br>Dear Ed
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Y'r letter came this forenoon &amp; am glad you keep well &amp; are satisfied at y'r
      occupation<sup><a href="#duk.00933_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—No doubt it will turn out well as
      it is a good business &amp; with ordinary luck will return a handsome
      income—&amp; besides it is y'r own choice &amp; satisfaction—wh' is a
      great point—Nothing very new or different here—If you were to come here
      (&amp; pleas'd w'd I be to see you, boy) now, you w'd see me seated by the oak wood
      fire in the big ratan chair with the gray wolf-skin spread on the back, &amp; the
      same old litter of papers &amp; MSS &amp; books around on the floor in the same old
      muss—I don't get any worse but no improvement in health or strength
      either—but I keep pretty good spirits &amp; eat &amp; sleep fairly
      yet—Have my daily curryings, &amp; get out often in wheel
      chair<sup><a href="#loc.03012_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Warren<sup><a href="#loc.07319_n6" id="r3">3</a></sup> has had a couple or three days
      sickness—the doctor was a little afraid of typhoid fever, but it seems to have
      pass'd over, &amp; he is getting ab't the same as before—Mrs: D[avis]<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r4">4</a></sup> is well—I send you a paper—hear from Dr B[ucke]<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r5">5</a></sup> often—he is well &amp; busy—Warren is learning the
      fiddle—he is getting along well—takes lessons of Watson<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r6">6</a></sup>.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good bye for the present, Ed, &amp; my remembrances &amp; love to you, boy—</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00933_n1">1. On , Wilkins informed Whitman that he
      had left Camden because he was unhappy with his Camden friends and because he
      wanted to enter the "Veterinary business."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03012_n1">2. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07319_n6">3. Frank Warren Fritzinger
      (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
      nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
      of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a blind sea captain, and
      Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and his
      brother–having lost both parents–became wards of Mary O. Davis,
      Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
      inherited part of his estate. <a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6113">4. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_92.html">Davis, Mary Oakes (1837 or 1838–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
