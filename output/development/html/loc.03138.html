   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your kind letter is received and the sad news of your ill health [
      <span class="unclear">makes?</span>]
      this pleasant weather [
      <span class="unclear">now?</span>]
       seem tiresome and out of place. I had hoped to find you the same [
      <span class="unclear">hole?</span>]
       and whole man I had met in New York a few [
      <span class="unclear">years?</span>]
       go [
      <span class="unclear">and?</span>]
       now I shall perhaps find you [
      <span class="unclear">bearing?</span>]
       you a staff [
      <span class="unclear">and?</span>]
       full of pain and torture. However my dear friend as you have lived from <u>within</u> and nor from <u>without</u> I am sure you will be able to bear whatever comes with
      
      
      
      
      that beautiful faith and philosophy you have ever given us in your great and immortal
      chants.
   </p>
   <p>I am coming to you [
      <span class="unclear">really?</span>]
       <u>soon</u>, as you request; but I cannot say to day or yet tomorrow for I am in the midst of
      work and am not altogether my own [
      <span class="unclear">master?</span>]
      . But I will come and we will talk it all over together. In the meantime remember
      that whateer befalls you you have the [
      <span class="unclear">perfect?</span>]
       love and sympathy of many if not all of the noblest and [
      <span class="unclear">loftiest?</span>]
       natures of the two hemispheres. Till I see you my dear friend and fellow toiler goodbye

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Joaquin Miller was the pen name of Cincinnatus Heine
      Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of the Rockies" and
      "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <em>Westminster Review</em>
      described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness which marked Walt Whitman's
      poetry." In an entry in his journal dated August 1, 1871, John Burroughs
      recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's poetry; see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin Co., 1931), 60. Whitman met Miller for the first time later in 1872; he
      wrote of a visit with Miller in a 
      letter to Charles W. Eldridge.
