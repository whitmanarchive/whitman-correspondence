   <p>Have rec'd to-day yours of Feb. 21.<sup><a href="#nyp.00578_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> 
      Send you herewith a little Preface<sup><a href="#nyp.00578_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> to "Specimen Days"<sup><a href="#nyp.00578_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—it might make two pages—
      Send me three or four slip impressions
      when in type—Yes, you can retain the Edgar Poe lines on p 17 as you
      wish—&amp; in brief (having no doubt you will remember what I have said or
      suggested) I hereby empower you to make any arrangements or ways the publishing
      exigencies there or your own judgment require—
   </p>
   
   <p>I will probably send a short MS to be added on p 199 or p 200 to bring my diary up
      (or nearly up) to date—Something possibly also to the 2d Vol.—giving
      both books a touch (at any rate) of <em>original identity</em> &amp;
      fulness—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00578_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Ernest Rhys | 59 Cheyne Walk | Chelsea | London | England. It is postmarked:
      Camden | Mar | 8 | 6 PM | 1887 | N.J.; London S.W. | [illegible] | Mr 18 [illegible] | 87.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00578_n2">2. The letter appears to be
      lost.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00578_n3">3. Included with this letter
      is the Preface, reprinted in <em>November Boughs</em>
      (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1888), 93–94. According to a letter dated May
      23, 1889, Rhys offered Harry Buxton Forman a number of Whitman manuscripts
      including "'Specimen Days &amp; Collect' with Whitman's corrections in
      ink-pencil"; the price was £2.2s.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00578_n4">4. Whitman had sent the copy
      of <em>Specimen Days</em> on February 2, 1887 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On  Rhys wrote: "I must not decide
      off-hand about the <em>Specimen Days</em>,—that is, whether
      to make two vols. as you suggest, or to try &amp; get the whole into one. In the
      latter case, the book would be rather crowded. . . No! I would not think of
      putting the copy of <em>Specimen Days</em> with your corrections
      into the printers' hands and will get copies from Wilson of Glasgow, carefully
      following all your deletions &amp; so on. It is one of the greatest prizes I
      possess, &amp; someday a sense of its value will inspire me, I'm afraid, to beg
      you to send me a copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> too with your
      name in it, (&amp; mine, as proof of ownership,) &amp; some further inscription
      as well." On  Rhys wrote at length
      about a kind of epiphany which he had experienced at the seashore; Whitman
      termed it "a wonderful letter."<a href="#r4">[back]
