      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00396_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> handed me your note yesterday and I enclose the within $6, $5 from myself and $1
      from Mother.<sup><a href="#loc.00396_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I wish Walt that I could do more and will try to collect a little something. I have
      made one or two attempts already but failed, entirely. Have you written to any of
      your driver friends,<sup><a href="#loc.00396_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> if you could strike them I should think you might get something. Probasco<sup><a href="#loc.00396_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> sent you $5 yesterday and Mr Lane would have sent you some to-day but I told him
      that I thought that it would be better for all concerned if we put a little time between
      the letters. I am in hopes to raise a few dollars more in a week or two which I will
      send you. I wish you would take either Lane's or Probasco['s] money and keep an exact
      account of what it does and send them the particulars of just the good it does. I
      think it would assist them (and the rest of us) in collecting more &nbsp;You can understand
      what an effect twould have, twould give us an opportunity to show what immense good a few shillings even will do when
      rightly applied &nbsp;besides twould please the person sending the money hugely twould bring his good deeds under his nose
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have had some two or three letters from Heyde, directed to you. He talks like a
      d—m fool. He says that he saw that your feelings and sympathies were excited by the
      things that you saw and says that he would desire to call them a little nearer home,
      and then follows a lot of stuff ending with the request that you will come on and
      get Han and bring her home, as he cant paint. The miserable skunk. I would like to
      get a fair chance at his ugly mug.<sup><a href="#loc.00396_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Mother has written to him that Mat will come on after Han, and we are now waiting
      a reply. The day after each letter came to you mother would get one from him, stating
      that he was under the influence of quinine and soda, and that he had boils, on his
      rump bone, and that his blood was bad (d—m his blood) and that he couldn't paint)
      and that charity, public charity, would have to relieve them, and a hell of a lot
      of other things all <em>meaning</em> that he wants to shake Han off. Undoubtedly we shall have her home before long. He
      says she is sick, but I think that if she was she would write home herself. It makes
      mother feel pretty bad. that combined with all her other troubles, I think, shows
      on her. She of course is with Mat and I most of the time and we try to make things
      as pleasant as possible &nbsp;Ed and Jess are the same as usual
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr Lane says that we ought to do something to help you to get a situation there &nbsp;If
      we can do any thing in the way of letters let us know. Lane thinks that you might
      do something with Dana.<sup><a href="#loc.00396_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Can you? Did you get the papers that I sent you, I sent 15 copies.<sup><a href="#loc.00396_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> Walt write me as often as possible as you cannot imagine how interesting they are
      to me. We all read them, Lane Probasco &amp;c &amp;c. They make us see things through new
      eyes
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother is about as well as usual. Mattie ditto. Sis is growing more interesting than
      ever, and more mischiefous than the old dickens &nbsp;she talks of you and Uncle George quite often &nbsp;Mother and Mat
      send their love. Mat says she is much obliged for her letter and will answer it herself
      soon.<sup><a href="#loc.00396_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> What are you doing and how are you getting along? Things the same as usual with me.
      Write me soon and often &nbsp;We had a long letter from George to-day &nbsp;He says he thinks
      that he will try for a furlough and that if they wont let him have it that he may
      resign. I rather think Walt that he is more tired than he lets us know. I wish to
      God that he would come home, I think that it would add 10 years to Mothers life. Write
      him. With love from all dear brother &nbsp;Good night

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00396_n1">1. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
      and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter of
      , and later various sums which
      Whitman acknowledged in letters from , , , and . In his letter of , Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in the
      Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman wrote,
      obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of money,
      contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly
      through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted Whitman
      in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from , and ). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal welfare that on , he sent through Jeff $5 "for your
      own especial benefit."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00396_n2">2. In a letter of , Walt Whitman indicated that Jeff
      and his mother ought not to make personal contributions to the hospital fund
      since he himself was carrying the family's share of the national burden.
      Nonetheless, and despite his own shortage of funds, Jeff continued to
      contribute. See Jeff's letter of .

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00396_n3">3. Omnibus drivers in New
      York City and Brooklyn. One of the poet's favorite pastimes was to ride the
      omnibuses and sit beside the drivers whom he befriended. Occasionally, when a
      driver was sick, the poet would take his place without remuneration.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00396_n4">4. Samuel R. Probasco
      (1833–1910) was an assistant engineer at the Brooklyn Water Works from
      1856 to 1868 and principal assistant engineer on the Brooklyn Water Board from
      1871 to 1875.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00396_n5">5. Heyde's treatment of
      Hannah frequently provoked Jeff's anger. See Jeff's letter of , and Jerome M. Loving, ed., <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> (Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975), 11–12.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00396_n6">6. Moses Lane wrote to
      Captain James J. Dana on December 16, 1862, asking him to assist Walt Whitman in
      his search for George (Feinberg).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00396_n7">7. These may have
      contained Walt Whitman's article, "Our Brooklyn Boys in the War," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, January 5, 1863. See Jeff's letter
      of .<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="loc.00396_n9">9. Charles E. Botsford
      sent Walt Whitman one dollar on July 7, 1863. See Jeff's letter to Whitman of
