   <p>I got home all safe—We stopped a day &amp; a night at Niagara &amp; had a first
      rate time—Started the next morning early in an easy comfortable palace car
      &amp; went on like a streak through New York and Pennsylvania—got into
      Philadelphia after 11 at night—(we were an hour late,)—but the city looked
      bright &amp; all alive, &amp; I felt as fresh as a lark—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am well, my summer in Canada has done me great good—it is not only the fine
      country &amp; climate there, but I found such good friends, good quarters, good
      grub, &amp; every thing that could make a man happy—

   <p>The last five days I have been down on a jaunt to the sea-shore<sup><a href="#yal.00114_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—got back last night—It is a great change
      from the beautiful grass and spacious lawns there around the Asylum—for miles
      as far as the eye can reach nothing but flat gray sand &amp; the sea rolling
      in—&amp; then looking off at sea, always ships or steamers in sight out in the
      offing—I sat hours enjoying it, for it suits me—I was born &amp; brought
      up near the Sea, &amp; I could listen forever to the hoarse music of the
      surf—Tom I got your paper &amp; handbill—<u>good for
         you, boy</u>—believe me I was pleased to know you won—best respects
      to Tom Bradley, Batters and Dick Flynn &amp; O'Connor<sup><a href="#yal.00114_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup>—show them this letter—also Canuth<sup><a href="#yal.00114_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup>—write to me—I hope you practice &amp; write

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00114_n1">1. This letter bears the
      address: Thomas Nichelson | Asylum for the Insane | London | Ontario Canada. It
      is postmarked: (?) | Oct | 15 | N.J.; London | Oc 16 | 80 | Ont.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00114_n6">2. Written in red on the letter
      in an unknown hand is the date: "1880." Written on the envelope is the date:
      "Oct 14 1880."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00114_n2">3. Whitman noted sending
      this letter in his Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
      Nicholson, who was twenty-one, was an attendant in Dr. Richard Bucke's asylum
      from April 12, 1880, to September 14, 1882. In his only extant letter to the
      poet, on , Nicholson urged Whitman
      to come to London, Ontario: "Every body <u>loves you</u>, and
      you wount be no Stranger this Time." Perhaps Nicholson, or one of his friends,
      is referred to in the following description in Edmund Gosse's <em>Critical Kit-Kats</em>: "The other . . . was a photograph of a very
      handsome young man in a boat, sculling. . . . He explained . . . that this was
      one of his greatest friends, a professional oarsman from Canada, a well-known
      sporting character" ([London: William Heinemann, 1896], 104–105).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00114_n3">4. According to his
      Commonplace Book, Whitman was with the Staffords from October 9 to 13, not at
      the seashore, unless he was with Harry in Atlantic City.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00114_n4">5. These young men, like
      Nicholson, were employees in Richard Bucke's hospital. Thomas Bradley, age 23,
      served at the asylum from September 6, 1876, to April 30, 1877, when he was
      discharged. He rejoined the staff on June 1, 1877, and was employed until April
      30, 1882, holding such positions as mail driver, assistant baker, and messenger.
      He again returned to the asylum on July 1, 1882, only to resign three months
      later. Edward Batters, who was 42, worked at the hospital in 1873 and 1874,
      until he was discharged. He was rehired in 1875 and remained until March 31,
      1881, at which time he was a supervisor. Richard Flynn, age 24, was employed
      from 1875 to 1885, working as a messenger, a gardener, a night watchman, and a
      stoker. Henry O'Connor, age 22, was an attendant from August 15, 1879, until he
      was discharged on November 12, 1880 (<em>Walt Whitman: The
         Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 3:190–191 n57).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00114_n5">6. Probably Whitman referred
      to Gomley Canniff, an eighteen-year-old attendant, who worked at the asylum from
      January 1 to November 30, 1880.<a href="#r6">[back]
