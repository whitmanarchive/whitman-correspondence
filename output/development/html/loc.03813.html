   </p>   
   
   <p>I am writing to you from Mary's<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> to tell you about her and
      her dear little baby, four weeks old. It is another little girl to be called
      Katherine Elizabeth,<sup><a href="#n6186" id="r3">3</a></sup> but Karin (pronounced like the "a" in
      'car') for short. She is a dear good little baby with large blue eyes, and Ray<sup><a href="#n3137" id="r4">4</a></sup> is so pleased with her little sister. She calls her
      "isser" &amp; likes to kiss &amp; stroke her. Mary is not as well as she ought to
      be, a toublesome wisdom tooth having followed the appearance of the baby, and that
      is why she hasnot written to you, though she has thought of you very often. The rest
      of us are all well &amp; very pleased to be back in England again. Father<sup><a href="#n4979" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; Mother &amp; I spent the winter
      in France
      &amp; Italy &amp; we enjoyed the trip very much indeed, but still nothing compares
      to London &amp; to the dear old Thames running by us here.
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>Mr. Rhys<sup><a href="#n4152" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; his sister<sup><a href="#loc.03813_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup> are near
      neighbours of ours in Westminster &amp; I have seen the sister once since I came
      home. I think she is very pretty &amp; charming, as you said.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Have you seen that novel "The Story of an African Farm"? We saw a good deal of the author, Olive
      Schreiner,<sup><a href="#n7503" id="r8">8</a></sup> when we were in the Riviera, &amp; she is such
      an interesting girl. She has wonderful dark eyes &amp; a lovely expressive face,
      &amp; her conversation is most delightful. I wish that she were going to America
      instead of back to Africa, so that you could see her.— Mary sends you a great
      deal of love &amp; so do I, dear Mr. Whitman. We hope you are pretty well. Will you
      give my love to Mrs. Davis?<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r9">9</a></sup></p>

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">2. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="n6186">3. Karin Stephen (née Catherine
      Elizabeth Costelloe) (1889–1953) was the second daughter of Mary Whitall
      Smith Costelloe. She would become a British psychoanalyst and psychologist, and
      the wife of Adrian Stephen (psychoanalyst and prominent member of the Bloomsbury Group,
      
      and brother of Virginia Woolf).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3137">4. Rachel Pearsall Conn Costelloe
      (1887–1940), later known as Ray Strachey, was the first daughter of Mary
      Whitall Smith Costelloe. She would later become a feminist writer and
      politician.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n4979">5. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4152">6. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.03813_n3">7. Smith may be referring to Rhys's
      sister Edith. Edwin Haviland Miller speculates that the "Edith" Whitman refers to
      in his , letter to Rhys is Rhys's sister.

   <p id="n7503">8. Olive Schreiner (1855–1920) was born in South Africa 
      and became an author who was well known for her writings on gender, race, and
      class, as well as those opposed to British Imperialism in South Africa. Though she
      wrote
      a number of political works, she is now probably best known for her novel <em>The Story of an African Farm</em> and her feminist non-fiction
      tract <em>Woman and Labour</em> (Carolyn Burdett, "Introduction,"
      <em>Olive Schreiner</em> [Tavistock:Northcote House
