      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your note,<sup><a href="#nyp.00285_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> with
      Ferdinand Freilegrath's<sup><a href="#nyp.00285_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> address, at Cologne. I have called on Mr. Westermann,<sup><a href="#nyp.00285_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> who seemed to
      think, upon the whole, that the best way to reach F. F. would be to direct to him
      to
      care of his publisher, J. G. Cotta, at Stuttgart, Germany. I should like to make up
      a package for F. F.—but most that I want send him is there in Washington.
      Still, I may attempt it here. I will write you further about it.<sup><a href="#nyp.00285_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am having pleasant quiet times here—am occupied a little, &amp; loafe around
      a great deal—am having fixed up, &amp; bound, (partly printed too,) the
      remainings of Leaves of Grass, edition 1867—as there are none on hand, &amp;
      there is a small demand. Am also writing &amp;c a little. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My dear mother I find in unusual health &amp; spirits, for one of her age. We are
      moving into the new quarters—much more agreeable &amp; roomy, when settled,
      than the old ones. My brother George is well &amp; hearty. Eddy the same. Mother
      sends her love to you &amp; Nelly. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received yesterday a kind note from Dr. Channing,<sup><a href="#nyp.00285_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      offering me hospitality at Providence. I shall gladly accept—shall certainly
      make them a visit of a few days before I return to Washington. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am rooming at Mrs. Price's, but spend a great part of every day with Mother, always
      taking dinner there. The journey to &amp; fro, &amp; especially crossing the ferry,
      &amp; resuming my acquaintance with the pilots, is quite a part of my pleasure here. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had quite an interview <em>tete-a-tete</em> with John Swinton a few
      nights ago. He is much more deeply impressed with <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> than I had supposed—said that the more he read it, the more it 
      imprest
      
       him with the meanness &amp; superficiality of all current literature &amp;
      journalism—went on in a strain that would have answered your &amp; John
      Burroughs's extremest demands, &amp;c.<sup><a href="#nyp.00285_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Swinton has lately been posting himself about William Blake, his poems—has the
      new London edition of W. B. in two vols.<sup><a href="#nyp.00285_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> He,
      Swinton, gives me rather new information in one respect—says that the formal
      resemblance between several pieces of Blake, &amp; my pieces, is so marked that he,
      S, has, with persons that partially know me, passed them off temporarily for mine,
      &amp; read them aloud as such. He asked me pointedly whether I had not met with
      Blake's productions in my youth, &amp;c—said that Swinburne's idea of
      resemblance &amp;c was not so wild, after all. Quite funny, isn't it?<sup><a href="#nyp.00285_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Tell John Burroughs I send him my love, &amp; I wish you to let him have an
      opportunity of reading this letter, if he desires to. Charles Eldridge the same.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Is Ashton<sup><a href="#nyp.00285_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> there, &amp; well—&amp; what news in the office?
   </p>

      <br></br>Dear Nelly.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am writing this in my room at Mrs. Prices. We had rain all last night, and now a
      rainy, cloudy, dark Sunday. I was down late to breakfast this morning—had a
      good breakfast though—nobody home but Mrs. Price &amp; Mr. Arnold<sup><a href="#nyp.00285_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup>—I
      like the latter more than formerly—after breakfast we sat leisurely &amp; had
      a good chat—subject, the Roman Catholic religion—anent of Mrs. Rein's
      sister &amp; adopted sister being Catholics. When I rose I said I was going up to my
      room to write to you &amp; William—there were warm expressions from
      both—Mrs. Price charged me to give her love to you, to William, &amp; to
      Jeannie—Mr. A. said "Give my love to Mrs. O'Connor, she is a woman I
      like—Mr. O'Connor I believe I have never seen." Good bye for the present,
      dear friends.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00285_n1">1. This letter's envelope
      bears the address, "William D. O'Connor, | Light House Bureau, | Treasury
      Department, | Washington, | D.C." It is postmarked: "New York | Sep |
      28."<br><br>
      A draft of this letter appears on the verso of Walt Whitman's  letter to Peter Doyle.

         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00285_n4">4. Whitman refers to Bernard
      Westermann, publisher and importer of books, whose office was at 440
      Broadway.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00285_n5">5. Walt Whitman followed up on

   <p id="nyp.00285_n7">7. The enthusiasm of Swinton
      (to whom Walt Whitman first wrote on ) for Walt Whitman was unbounded. On , Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly impressed with
      the great humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you. I read this
      afternoon in the book. I read its first division which I never before read. I
      could convey no idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more to me than all
      other books and poetry."<a href="#r7">[back]

      <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> and <em>Poetical Sketches</em>, published by Pickering and edited by
      R. H. Shepherd, appeared in 1868; see Geoffrey Keynes, <em>A
         Bibliography of William Blake</em> (New York: Grolier Club of New York,
      1921), 268–269.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00285_n9">9. On , O'Connor commented: "Swinton's
      discovery of the resemblance in form between Leaves of Grass and Blake's poetry,
      is in my humble opinion, a mare's nest of the first water. (Irish!!) The
      resemblance is extremely superficial–about as much as between the
      Gregorian chant, bellowed by bull-necked priests with donkey lips, and a
      first-class, infinitely varied, complex-melodied Italian opera, sung by voices
      half-human, half-divine."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00285_n10">10. J. Hubley Ashton, the
      assistant Attorney General, actively interested himself in Walt Whitman's
      affairs, and obtained a position for the poet in his office after the Harlan
      fracas.<a href="#r10">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00285_n11">11. A friend of the Prices,
      John Arnold lived with his daughter's family in the same house as the Price
      family. Helen Price described him as "a Swedenborgian," with whom Walt Whitman
      frequently argued without "the slightest irritation between them"; see Richard
      Maurice Bucke, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay,
      1883), 26–27.<a href="#r11">[back]
