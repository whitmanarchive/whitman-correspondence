   <p>Your two letters including the cheque for £25 reached me, for which accept deepest
      thanks.<sup><a href="#loc.02836_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I have already written you my approval of your three communications in the L[ondon]
      D[aily] News<sup><a href="#loc.02836_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; will [say] that in my opinion (&amp; now with fullest deliberation reäffirming it)
      <em>all the points assumed 
         as facts on which your letter of March 13 is grounded, are substantially true, &amp; most
         of them are true 
         to the minutest particular</em>—as far as could be stated in a one column letter.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Then let me quite definitely explain myself, about one or two things. I should not
      have instigated this English move, 
      &amp; if I had been consulted,<sup><a href="#loc.02836_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> should have peremptorily stopt it—but now that it has started, &amp; grown, and under the circumstances, 
      &amp; by the person, &amp; in the spirit, (&amp; especially as I can &amp; will give, to each generous
      donor, my book,
      portrait, autograph, myself as it were)—I am determined to respond to it in the same
      spirit in which it has 
      risen—to accept most thankfully, cordially &amp; unhesitatingly all that my friends feel
      to convey to me, 
      which determination I here deliberately express once for all. This you are at liberty
      to make known to all 
      who feel any interest in the matter.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The situation at present may be briefly &amp; candidly told. I am, &amp; have for three years
      during my paralysis, 
      been boarding here, with a relative, comfortable &amp; nice enough, but steadily paying
      just the same as at an inn—and 
      the whole affair in precisely the same business spirit. My means would by this time
      have entirely given out, 
      but that have been temporarily replenished from sales of my new edition and as now
      by this most welcome present 
      &amp; purchase—the £25 herein acknowledged.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Though without employment, means or income, you augur truly that I am not in what
      may be called pinching want—nor do I anticipate it.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> My object I may say farther has lately been &amp; still is to build a cheap little<sup><a href="#loc.02836_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> three or four room house on a little lot I own in a rural skirt 
      of this town—for a nook, where I can haul in &amp; eke out in a sort of independent economy
      &amp; comfort 
      &amp; as satisfactorily as may be the rest of my years—for I may live several of them
      yet. To attain this, 
      would be quite a triumph, &amp; I feel assured I could then live very nicely indeed on
      the income from my books.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall (as I see now) continue to be my own publisher &amp; bookseller. Accept all subscriptions
      to the New Edition. 
      All will be supplied upon remittance. There are Two Volumes. Leaves of Grass, 384
      pages, poems, $5, has two portraits. 
      Then <em>Two Rivulets</em>, poems &amp; prose, (including "<em>Memoranda of the War</em>")
      with photos, altogether 359 pages—also 
      $5. Each book has my autograph. The Two Volumes are my complete works, $10 the set.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish the particular address of each generous friend given, so as he or she can be
      reach'd by mail 
      or express—either with the autographic volume <em>Two Rivulets</em>, or a complete set of my works in Two Volumes, 
      with autograph &amp; portraits, or some other of my books. It may be some while before
      the books arrive, 
      but they <em>will</em> arrive in time.<sup><a href="#loc.02836_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02836_n1">1. This draft letter is
      endorsed, "Robt Buchanan | (must have gone 17th by Scotia | from N.Y.)";
      "Buchanan | May 16 '76."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02836_n2">2. 
      On , in a letter marked
      "Private," Buchanan discussed the English campaign on Walt Whitman's behalf
      and, probably because he was perplexed by Walt Whitman's contradictory
      statements, pressed for a specific statement: "Moncure Conway has denied
      authoritatively that you wanted money, &amp; I have been waiting &amp;
      wondering what to do. . . . I wish I were a rich man . . . and you should
      certainly never want anything your heart craved . . . happy, Whitman, in the
      serene certainty that you have fulfilled your life, &amp; spoken—in
      tunes no thunders can silence—the beautiful message you were fashioned
      to bring!"<br><br>
      On , Buchanan sent Walt Whitman a
      check for £25, including a contribution of £5 from Tennyson, with a list of
      those who had subscribed £22.15. Walt Whitman sent books on September 5,
      1876 (see Whitman's  letter
      to Buchanan). <a href="#r2">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02836_n4">4. Walt Whitman deleted the
      following passage: "There is doubtless a point of view from which Mr. Conway's
      statement of April 4th might hold, technically—but, essentially, under the
      circumstances, . . ." Despite the poet's denials, Conway's statement (see
      Whitman's  letter to William Michael
      Rossetti) was justified.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02836_n5">5. Originally Walt Whitman
      wrote: "a little 100, 6 or $700 house."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02836_n6">6. Walt Whitman struck out
      the following: "I should like Wm M Rossetti, and Prof. Dowden of Dublin to see
      this letter."<a href="#r6">[back]
