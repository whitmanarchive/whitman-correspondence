   <p>Have just rec'd another good (pretty long) letter f'm my friends in Australia<sup><a href="#loc.07843_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—(a fine cluster, men &amp; women, centred in
      Melbourne)—&amp; have just sent word in answer<sup><a href="#loc.07843_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—somehow to be read so thoroughly &amp; made so much of by those tried &amp;
      thoughtful folks of both sexes, away off at the antipodes, drives deep into
      me—The wet &amp; cloudy days have pass'd &amp; it is sunny &amp; fine
      to-day—I made my breakfast of oysters brown bread &amp; coffee—have sent
      my big book, your W W, &amp; John Burroughs' Notes, with a cluster of my portraits
      all in a bundle by express to Ingersoll<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r4">4</a></sup>, 45 Wall st N Y (as I
      heard he had not y'r book)<sup><a href="#loc.07843_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Shall probably get out
      in wheel chair this aft'n—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Saturday a m Oct: 4—Fine sunny day—The Ing: address will probably be (as
      I before told you) at Horticultural Hall, Phil: ab't 22d Oct<sup><a href="#loc.07843_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup>—but the definite decision waits for Ing's
      word—(he was absent f'm N Y yesterday)—I doubt if Mrs: O'C[onnor]<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r7">7</a></sup> tumbles to my "preface"<sup><a href="#loc.07351_n4" id="r8">8</a></sup>—she
      probably expected something more conventional &amp; literary—but I find (upon
      second &amp; more deliberate tho't) I have said it as I wanted to ab't Wm O'C<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r9">9</a></sup> &amp; my wish to put on record such a testimony (tho' short)
      signed by my name, suits me exactly, &amp; is consistent with the proposed
      book—I will send you the MS.—I have rec'd a formal invitation to write
      for the N[orth] A[merican] Review<sup><a href="#loc.07843_n6" id="r10">10</a></sup> &amp; sh'l probably do
      so.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0839">4. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n4137">7. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

   <p id="loc.07351_n4">8. Three of O'Connor's
      stories with a preface by Whitman were published in <em>Three
         Tales: The Ghost, The Brazen Android, The Carpenter</em> (Boston and New
      York: Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., 1892). The preface was included in <em>Good-Bye My Fancy</em> (1891), 51-53.<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="n2002">9. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
