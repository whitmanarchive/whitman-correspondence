      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:       
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I have been hard at work ever since I was up to see you,<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r2">2</a></sup> I thought I would write a few lines to let you know how I am getting on with it (threshing
      I mean) we will finish by Saturday, if nothing happens, and I will be very glad of
      it for I am very sick of it. Mont.<sup><a href="#n0910" id="r3">3</a></sup> is helping me, he is as bad against as I am. Father<sup><a href="#n0852b" id="r4">4</a></sup> went to the city with a load of straw today; perhaps he will be over in time to stop
      and see you. I believe the work is doing me good in some ways for it is making me
      eat more than ever
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>You will not know me when you see me. I am getting so brown and fat.</p>
   
   
   <p>Mont. received your papers today, those giving the account of the execution, it went
      over to Glendale before he got it. He was much pleased with it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear Walt I have saved enough out of that dollar you gave me to come up and see you.
      I have been trying to find a day to come up and see you but cannot until we finish
      threshing. I have been thinking it all over and will be up on Tuesday, next, one week
      from tomorrow if nothing happens. I want to spend the day with you, and have a good
      talk, have some good cigars for me. (I know you will, won't you?) Debbie and Joe,<sup><a href="#n1011" id="r5">5</a></sup> were home yesterday and stayed all day. Capt. Townsend and wife<sup><a href="#n1048" id="r6">6</a></sup> were over
      
      
      too. Lizzie<sup><a href="#nyp.00417_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup> was over Saturday afternoon, stayed until late and of course I went home with her,
      had a good time with her, I told her about you sending your love to her, she sends
      you back the same, she says she would like to see you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been home ever since I was up to see you: there is but very little news about
      here now, everything is the same as when you left here. Father is about the same as
      when you were down. Mother is well and all the rest of the folks. Mont and all the
      rest sends their love to you. Will have to close as Ed<sup><a href="#n0589b" id="r8">8</a></sup> wishes to close up the store. Will be up Tuesday if nothing happens.

   <p id="loc.03976_n1">1. The envelope for the letter
      bears the address: Walt Whitman | Camden City | Camden City | N. J. It is
      endorsed, in Walt Whitman's hand: Jan 13 '79.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0590">2. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
