      My dear Walt Whitman,
      
      
   </p>  
   
   <p>
      A lovely &amp; perfect day here,—air fresh &amp; sweet with pleasant breezes. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Immediately after I wrote to you yesterday afternoon the sky became suddenly overspread
      
      with storm clouds of wonderful beauty, &amp; presently the rain began to pour &amp; a 
      thunderstorm began. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      It was all over by tea time &amp; the evening was clear &amp; beautiful—the 
      [
      <span class="unclear">bursts?</span>]
      
      of cumulus cloud on the Eastern horizon glowing with [illegible]
      
      colours &amp; effects as Dr.<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; I walked across to the office in the evening. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      A pleasant evening, with delightful talks with Dr. He showed me a letter from you.
      We were both very much 
      pleased to hear per H.L.T.<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r3">3</a></sup> of Dr. Longaker's report. Glad to hear, too, that the oculist's 
      report was favourable.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I have spent today very idly—giving the reins to my mood. But I have thoroughly enjoyed
      the perfect beauty 
      &amp; freshness of the day. 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      I was at the office a short time this morning &amp;  was very pleased to receive a parcel
      of papers addressed to me 
      by you. Thank you for your constant kindness &amp; thought. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      The Dr. showed me the copy of "The Literary World" rec'd from you, with the marked
      par. on "Good Bye" which I was 
      pleased to read. Since dinner I have looked through the two papers you sent, &amp; dipped
      into the pamphlet on 
      "Swedenborg." This last, however, I will put aside
          
      for another time. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Dr. is calling for me at 3 o'clock to go to town, so I write this brief note in the
      hope that I may post it there.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I hope that the day is equally beautiful with you, &amp; that you are fairly well. How
      it would please me to hear 
      that you have been out for a drive again! 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Give my affectionate regards to Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; Warry.<sup><a href="#loc.00668_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.04388_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman, | 328, Mickle St | Camden | <u>New Jersey |
         US.</u>. It is postmarked: London | AM | SP 19 | 91 | CANADA; [illegible] 91 | REC'D.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6113">4. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00668_n4">5. Frederick Warren Fritzinger
      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,
      535).<a href="#r5">[back]
