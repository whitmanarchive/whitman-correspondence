      waite
      
       for the fast line and reported it to Camden shut up the station and went
      home, got there bout
      11 O'clock, had a cup of coffee and 
      the

       dinner time, got up and went to Sunday school
      
      
      
      came home got supper and went to the pond, I had a headache, did not sleep
      very well last night, but feel <u>

       hard last night at the supper table, you must not let on if I tell you: he
      called me a "dam
      
       fool," I wasn't talking to him anyway! we was all talking of telegraphing,
      and father said he was reading of a man who was trying to [

       it and I said that I did not think he could do it and 
      the
      
       
      Herbret
      
       stuck in that, it did not fit very well, and if I had been near enough to

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0590">1. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>â€”though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
