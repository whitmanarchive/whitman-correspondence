   <p>In a letter from John Burroughs a while since he writes me that your article is to
      appear in <u>To-Day</u><sup><a href="#loc.02155_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—When printed I wish Herby w'd get
      ten copies &amp; send me by mail, (in two packages, five in each)—Nothing very
      different with me—I am full as well as common—a new &amp; good care-taker
      for me here in the house, the old ones gone,<sup><a href="#loc.02155_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Mrs.
      Davis, a sailor's widow, young &amp; strong &amp; good-natured, &amp; very kind
      &amp; attentive—according to indications a blessed change—I am writing a
      little—Shall probably add to next edition of L of G. at end not more than 30
      or 35 pages
   </p>
   
   <p><u>After-Songs and A Letter of Parting</u></p>
   
   <p>the "letter" prose a sort of résumé &amp; talk in general—The old
      bulk part of the book left all the same as now. I am writing this Sunday afternoon
      up in my room by wood fire. I suppose you rec'd the Camden <u>Post</u>.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Confession of Faith" appeared in <em>To-Day</em> in June.
      Whitman's "Resurgemus" ("Europe") had appeared in the same magazine the previous
      September. Whitman did not refer to Gilchrist's letter of , in which she spoke of "bronchial &amp;
      asthmatic troubles" and of her lasting affection—"you are in my thoughts
      as constantly as ever though I have been so silent."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.02155_n3">3. The Lay family were
      renting Whitman's Camden home when he bought it, and they stayed there for a
      month, caring for Whitman, after he moved in. See the letter from Whitman to
