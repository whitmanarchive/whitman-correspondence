      Whitman noted, "Oscar Wilde here a good part of the afternoon" (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). An account of this interview appeared on the
      following day in the <em>Philadelphia Press</em>. Whitman was
      evidently pleased with Wilde's letter of , in which he quoted Swinburne's praise of Whitman: "I have by no
      manner of means relaxed my admiration of his noblest works" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell
      Kennerley, 1915], 2:288). The quotation was from a letter written by Swinburne
      to Wilde on February 2 (Feinberg). Note also the letter from Whitman to Benjamin
      Ticknor of . The meeting of Wilde
      and Whitman was satirized by Helen Gray Cone in "Narcissus in Camden," <em>The Century Magazine</em>, 25 (November 1882),
