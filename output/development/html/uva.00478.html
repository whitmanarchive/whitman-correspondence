   </p>
   
   <p>What is now the status of the Rolleston translation, with reference to
      publication?<sup><a href="#uva.00478_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I have seen your letter of some weeks
      since to Dr Bucke—tell me of any thing new—or probabilities. I
      particularly hope it is intended to give the English text of the pieces, either on
      the left-hand page or running in smaller type at the bottom of every page &amp;
      forming one third—
   </p>
   
   <p>If you have some loose sheets (last proofs, or what not) of your new "Representative
      German Poems,"<sup><a href="#uva.00478_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> send me three or four pages. (I dont want
      the book, but just want to see how it is made up, paged &amp; printed)—My
      health is about as usual, except a worse lameness—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
