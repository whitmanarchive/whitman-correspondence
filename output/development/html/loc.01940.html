   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles P. Somerby was one of the book dealers whom
      Walt Whitman termed "embezzlers." In 1875 Somerby assumed the liabilities of
      Butts &amp; Co.; see Whitman's ,
      letter to Asa K. Butts &amp; Company. This proved to be a matter of
      embarrassment to Somerby, who, in reply to a lost letter on March 16, 1875, was
      unable "to remit the amount you name at present." On , he wrote: "It is very mortifying to me not to be in a
      position to send you even a small portion of the balance your due." On , Somerby sent $10â€”his only cash
      payment: "Have made every exertion to raise the $200 you require, and find it
      utterly impossible to get it. . . . We had hoped that you would accept our offer
      to get out your new book, and thus more than discharge our indebtedness to you."
      On , Somerby reported that "I have
      been losing, instead of gaining." On ,
      he sent Walt Whitman a statement pertaining to the volumes mentioned in this
      letter. On , he included a complete
      financial statement: in eighteen months he had made only one cash payment, and
      owed Walt Whitman $215.17. The firm was still unable to make a payment on . In August 1877, Walt Whitman
      received a notice of bankruptcy dated August 8, 1877,
       from, in his
      own words, "assignee [Josiah Fletcher, an attorney] of the rascal Chas P.
      Somerby." These manuscripts are in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.
