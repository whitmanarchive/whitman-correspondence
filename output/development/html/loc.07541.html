   <p>Have had a pretty bad day—ab't one of the real bad spells (except no really
      <em>definite</em> spell such as that special Monday)—but giving out the last 6 or 8
      hours most physical &amp; moral energy—no action at all of bowels or water
      works—no eating—have just risen and eaten three or four
      mouthfuls—(Baker's<sup><a href="#loc.07541_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> strong advise)—am now
      sitting here in the chair (3.40 P M)—At this moment indicates rain
      shower—Y'r letter rec'd—I hope Eng. ed'n "Dem Vistas<sup><a href="#loc.07518_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp;c" will come
      yet safely—it is the best specimen of typographic make &amp; binding (for
      modest expense) yet turned out there—Suppose you've got the further proofs to
      page 70<sup><a href="#loc.07510_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—mail'd them yesterday—Shall have some little mendings, changings
      &amp;c. to plates.

   <p><em>Later Thursday—9½ p m</em>—I am less
      uncomfortable—Horace Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r5">5</a></sup> has been in for a short
      visit, &amp; to bring the latest print proofs &amp;c:—All things go on &amp; I
      am satisfied so far (I have just paid him, Ferguson, $50)<sup><a href="#loc.07541_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup>—have just swallowed a calomel powder preparatory to go to bed—we have
      had a slight rain—the <em>quiet</em> in comparison of the last three days &amp; nights
      is very helpful to me—
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>Noon, Friday, July 6</em>—No particular change in the
      situation—I am appreciably better—bowels voided—temperature
      &amp;c. very fine—am sitting up quietly this moment—heavy rather dulness
      &amp; pain head—suppose you are up to your neck with work &amp;
      responsibility—well I rather envy it all, supposing &amp; the feeling &amp;
      ability &amp; physical <em>plus</em>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07541_n2">2. Nathan M. Baker was one
      of Whitman's caregivers. He would leave on July 15, 1888, to resume his medical
      training. Baker was replaced by W.A. Musgrove. For Whitman's comments on the
      transition, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.2.html">Monday, July 16, 1888</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n4267">5. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="loc.07541_n3">6. Walt Whitman began
      negotiations on May 25 with George Ferguson to set the type for <em>November Boughs</em> (1888). Ferguson agreed to charge $1.30
      for each page in long primer (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.58.html">Friday, May 25, 1888</a>). The first payment of $50 was made on July
      3 (Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.97.html">Tuesday, July 3,1888</a>).<a href="#r6">[back]
