      <br></br><br></br>My dear brother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter has only just reached me though I see the Brooklyn post office stamp is
      January 27th—I was gratified with Babcock's and Smith's letters, though I am very
      sorry they neither of them mentioned the date of Lt Caldwell's letter from Danville.<sup><a href="#loc.00838_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> If it should be much later than George's, which was November 27th, it would be a
      relief to know it—but I presume it was one of the same batch. Jeff, I have this morning
      written to Capt Mason,<sup><a href="#loc.00838_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> telling him where George is, &amp; asking him, as that would be ten times more likely
      to get through, if he will have (or direct some proper person) to put up a box of
      things to eat, &amp; given him George's address to send it through the lines, &amp; said that
      I or you would pay the bill of course, &amp; be most deeply obliged to him &amp; that I would
      have enclosed the money in the letter I sent him, but thought it safer to wait &amp; see whether it reached him.<sup><a href="#loc.00838_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I have written to George since I have been here in Washington. Also a few lines to
      Han. We have had very cold mean weather here ever since I arrived till to-day—it is
      now moderated &amp; very pleasant overhead.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am quite comfortable, have a comfortable room enough, with a wood stove, &amp; a pile
      of wood in the room, a first rate &amp; good big bed, &amp; a very friendly old secesh landlady
      whose husband &amp; son are off in the Southern army—she is different from any I have
      found yet here, is very obliging, starts my fire for me at 5 o'clock every afternoon,
      &amp; lights the gas, even, &amp; then turns it down to be ready for me when I come home.
      I get my meals where I can—they are poor &amp; expensive—You speak of the Indian office—it
      is a Bureau in the Department of the interior, which has charge of quite a large mass of business relating to the numerous
      Indian tribes in West &amp; Northwest, large numbers of whom are under annuities, supplies,
      &amp;c for the government. All I have hitherto employed myself about has been making copies
      of reports &amp; Bids, &amp;c for the office to send up to the Congressional Committee on
      Indian Affairs. It is easy enough—I take things very easy—the rule is to come at 9
      and go at 4—but I don't come at 9, and only stay till 4 when I want, as at present
      to finish a letter for the mail—I am treated with great courtesy, as an evidence of
      which I have to inform you that since I began this letter, I have been sent for by
      the cashier to receive my <em>PAY</em> for the arduous &amp; invaluable services I have already rendered to the government—I
      feel quite well, perhaps not as completely so as I used to was, but I think I shall get so this spring—as I did indeed feel yesterday better than I have
      since I was taken sick last summer.
   </p>
   
   <p>I spent yesterday afternoon in Armory Square Hospital,<sup><a href="#loc.00838_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; had a real good time, &amp; the boys had too. Jeff, you need not be afraid about my
      overdoing the matter. I shall go regularly enough, but shall be on my guard against
      trouble. I am also going to some of the camps about here, there is a great chance
      among them to do good, &amp; they are interesting places every way, for one who goes among
      the men. I have thought every day of Mother—dear Mother, I hope she gets along well
      this bitter weather—(about the hoop iron, I think it was the right thing to do<sup><a href="#loc.00838_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—the least they can do is to take it off)—My dear brother, you must by all means <em>come</em> &amp; see me—Martha, my dear sister, I send you &amp; the dear little torments my best, best
      love—Jeff, give my respects to Mr. Lane &amp; Dr Ruggles<sup><a href="#loc.00838_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00838_n1">1. Babcock, a lieutenant in
      George's regiment, wrote to Whitman on , and informed him that the prisoners were "pretty hard up for
      grub" and wanted things like "Salt Pork and hard tack" sent to them. Aaron
      Smith, probably of the Fifty-first Regiment, had written to Whitman on  and , while he was a patient at Carver Hospital, Washington. On , from Petersburg, he asked Whitman
      to send supplies to the Danville Military Prison. Lieutenant William Caldwell
      had been captured at the same time as George. He was a captain when Whitman
      mentioned him again in a letter from .
      According to jottings in a notebook, dated May 23–24 (Clifton Waller
      Barrett Collection, University of Virginia), Caldwell was born in Scotland and
      was 27; he had been "in the same fights as George."<a href="#r1">[back]

      George can reach him (yet I propose to keep sending, hoping that a proportion
