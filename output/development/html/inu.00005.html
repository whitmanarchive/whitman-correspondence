   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0301">2. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker from Long
      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his
      influence on Whitman, see David S. Reynolds, <em>Walt Whitman's
         America</em> (New York: Knopf, 1995), 37–39.<a href="#r2">[back]
