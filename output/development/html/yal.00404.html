      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n0705" id="r1">1</a></sup>,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am writing this lying in bed—the doctor wishes me to keep as much in bed as
      possible—but I <em>have</em> to keep in, as I cannot move yet without
      great difficulty, &amp; I am liable to dizziness &amp; nausea, at times, on trying to move,
      or even sitting up—But I am certainly over the worst of it, &amp; <em>really</em>—though slowly—<em>improving</em>. The doctor says
      there is no doubt of it—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yesterday afternoon I eat something like a meal for the first time—boiled chicken,
      &amp; some soup with bread broken up in it—relished it well—I still have many
      callers—only a few particular ones are admitted to see me—Mrs. O'Connor<sup><a href="#yal.00404_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> comes &amp; a young woman named Mary Cole<sup><a href="#yal.00404_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Mrs. Ashton has sent for me to be brought to her house, to
      be taken care of—of course I do not accept her offer—they live in grand style
      &amp; I should be more bothered than 
      benefitted
      
       by their refinements &amp; luxuries, servants, &amp;c<sup><a href="#yal.00404_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I want you to know truly, that I do not want for any thing—as to all the <em>little extra fixings</em> &amp; superfluities, I never did care for them in
      health, &amp; they only annoy me in sickness—I have a good bed—a fire—as
      much grub as I wish &amp; whatever I wish—&amp; two or three good friends
      here—So I want you to not feel at all uneasy—as I write, Peter Doyle<sup><a href="#yal.00404_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> is sitting by the window reading—he &amp; Charles
      Eldridge<sup><a href="#n0210" id="r6">6</a></sup> regularly come in &amp; do whatever I want, &amp; are both
      <em>very helpful</em> to me—one comes day time, &amp; one
      evening—I had a good night's sleep last night—My mind is just as clear as
      ever—&amp; has been all the time—(I have not been at all down hearted
      either)—(My January pay is due me, &amp; as soon as I get up, I shall forward you your
      $20.)<sup><a href="#yal.00404_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear sister Lou,<sup><a href="#yal.00404_n6" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter came this morning &amp; was very pleasant to get it—I shall be getting
      well soon—am on a fair way to it now—
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>latest ½ past 4</em>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just set up &amp; had my bed made by Pete—I am already beginning to feel
      something like myself—will write in 2 days—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00404_n1">2. Despite the gravity of Walt Whitman's
      condition, William O'Connor did not visit him: the breach between the two men
      was deep.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00404_n2">3. Mary Cole was listed in the Directories as
      a clerk in the Internal Revenue Department. Perhaps she was the sister of George
      D. Cole, a former conductor and a friend of Doyle, who wrote to Walt Whitman,
      , after he had
      become a sailor (Yale). Clara Barrus mentions May Cole, a friend of Ellen
      O'Connor, who later married Dr. Frank Baker of the Smithsonian Institute (<em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em>, [Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin, 1931].)<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00404_n3">4. In June, however, Walt Whitman consented
      to stay with the Ashtons for about ten days; in his  letter to Peter Doyle, Whitman asked Doyle to visit him
      there.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00404_n4">5. On , Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote: "i thought of peter. i knew if
      it was in his power to be with you he would and 
      cherefully

       everything that he could for you."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0210">6. Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
