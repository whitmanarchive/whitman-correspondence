   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr Child tells me you would like a piece from me for the <em>Tobacco
         Plant</em>.<sup><a href="#loc.05276_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Will this do? The price is
      $12—(? two pounds eight 
      shil)—
   </p>
   
   <p>If you print it I hope you have a good proof reader, &amp; that he will be very
      particular with it—
   </p>

   <p>P S—I am <em>not</em> an anti-tobacconist—On the
      contrary have seen how important &amp; valuable the sedative was in the
      extensive military hospitals of our Secession war—Still I do not smoke or
      chew myself—Sometimes wish I did smoke now in my old age &amp;
      invalidism—but it is too late to learn—
   </p>
   
   <p>But my brothers &amp; all my near friends are smokers, &amp; I am accustomed to
      it—live among smokers, &amp; always carry cigars in my pocket to give
      special friends who prize them—
