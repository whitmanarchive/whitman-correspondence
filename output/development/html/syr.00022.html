      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I got continued proofs of the <u>
         G.G.P</u> this morning, and your letter of the 14th this afternoon.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I find from this batch of proofs the necessity for a revise, which I hope you will
      have sent me, for I want the <u>
         G.G.P</u> to appear as it was in the pamphlet, a form which 
      always pleased us both, and you will see by my corrections, what a mess the poor printer
      has made of it. It is evidently not his fault, but Bucke's, and I really felt vexed
      at <u>him</u>. I furnished him with a carefully transcribed <u>printer's</u> copy of the pamphlet, and it is evident that the galoot has had my copy <u>copied</u>—his copy is of course omitting all the typographical directions and making paragraphs
      <u>ad libitum</u>. Hence, the mess! Why in thunder didn't Bucke send the copy I made for him!
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>However, spilt milk, &amp;c. Send me revises of both documents. It will hardly delay matters,
      and there will be the consolation of
      
      accuracy.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My <u>Good Gray</u> reads really well in the new version. I had no
      idea it was so good!!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am glad you liked the Introductory. It is likely to make some very pretty fighting,
      before all is done.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>After I sent it back to you, I remembered one typographical error I meant to correct,
      but 
      forgot it after all. It is on the first slip
      where I speak of Paul Louis Courier's "arrows of
      lightning." This should be "arrows of lightnings"—double plural. If I get a
      revise, I will correct: if not, you please have an "s" put on to my
      "lightning"—it is more effective, though a small matter.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dr. Channing and all send love to you. Jeannie is very weak, though her mind is
      bright and clear. If she weathers through this harsh spring, I shall have hopes of
      her. She has immense vitality, but injures  her chances by ascetic
      notions—total abstinence, etc.—and general desperate Hahnemanianism. It is bad when you don't
      do, in a general way what other people do, and go back upon a fair allowance of
      victuals and drink.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I got the "Man" this afternoon with  Parton's version of Hugo's
      magnificent oration on Voltaire, also the 
      Trubner
      
       catalogue, which I have not yet had time to look into.
      Thanks.
   </p>

   </p>
   
   
   <p>P.S. If the printer is puzzled show him a page of the pamphlet, which will show
      him how I want it set, with the short dashes following the periods, etc.
