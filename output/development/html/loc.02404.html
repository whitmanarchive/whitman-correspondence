      <br></br><br></br>To Walt Whitman—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I'll not <u>date</u> this, as I am away from home—farther than I've been for some time—at <u>town</u>, 13 miles away. You might [
      <span class="unclear">thus?</span>]
       direct a reply.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well I [illegible] sold my cotton bales. The market [illegible]. Compelled to sell to get money [illegible] tax. Had to agree to take one third [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">merchandise?</span>]
      . Think I've done well enough. At any rate what promises to <u>satisfy</u> one ought to be <u>well</u>. &amp; make the smallest [illegible] <u>a draw</u> and <u>wait</u>.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I believe I will enclose you one dollar (without registering) for <u>past</u> pay for J. Burroughs's<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r1">1</a></sup> book. You can let me know how much more will be required to get you [
      <span class="unclear">another?</span>]
       copy. I think you will [illegible] to keep the book I have. Then I can [illegible] it to my friends—and one's self likes to read a <u>good</u> book over many times—that is if one's self has fine good sense.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How I read the latter half of J.B's book quick and carefully at first—<u>then</u> wanted <u>time</u> to study the less important first half. I have loved The Birds,<sup><a href="#n0867" id="r2">2</a></sup> but <u>one needs names</u> to study anything, and I always distrusted getting right names from our composite,
      mongrel population, and also
      
      
      
      my eyes have been not strong enough for the purposes of Birds—[illegible] them <u>sore</u> by <u>reading</u> in early life—now at 45 &amp; 46 they are better than [
      <span class="unclear">from?</span>]
       10 to 25 and I read the finest print, new [illegible] glasses. But I'll not <u>make discovery</u> [illegible] and report to J.B—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Before Genius" [illegible] "Before Beauty" are good [illegible]. <u>Most</u> [illegible] are "just as surely coarse as they are fine." Probably General Lee was not <u>coarse</u>, but was he great?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>That John Burroughs is one of the most highly accomplished men in the world, I dont
      doubt but claim it for him, and <u>morally</u> his <u>likes and dislikes</u> promise or argue [illegible]. (I sent him a long letter in October already prepared and sent off a <u>few minutes</u> after getting his book. If you can remember, next time you write to him say for me
      I did not get his reply. He may think I should have written again.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This thing now while writing. Perhaps you would rather have to think a friend to be
      <u>vain</u> than to think him <u>stupid</u>. This might be the last time I can ever write to you—life is
      
      
      uncertain. When I saw that your new book was going to be called Two Rivulets I suspected
      it might be <u>you and I</u>—two "envisioned" and friendly souls. You must forgive me (even if you have to <u>laugh</u> enough to complete the restoration of your health)—but I have really called Two Rivulets
      <u>our</u> book. Then if you are rested enough to bear to laugh some more, I will say this—somebody
      [illegible] had a curious story published in Blackwood's Magazine<sup><a href="#n0869" id="r3">3</a></sup>—it was copied by an American newspaper which accidentally fell into my hands—I was
      prepared for it in [
      <span class="unclear">part?</span>]
      . It was copied in October 1876. If you could see the volume of Blackwoods [
      <span class="unclear">for?</span>]
       1876, maybe you will find it, and [
      <span class="unclear">need?</span>]
       to be prepared to be <u>indignant</u> for I think you were <u>abused one more time</u>. Maybe you know who wrote the story entitled "John's Hero"—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If I am "a seer" or in any way "great", certainly I am coarse as well as fine. Overflowing
      with lubricating <u>humor</u>.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Now if this all looks like a lot of foolishness and stupidity, you are a man of great
      charity and you can
   </p>
   
   
   <p>and you must</p>
   
   
   <p>forgive me.</p>
   
   
   <p>I see what Burroughs says about Emerson's writings, and think I must order some of
      his books. A friend sent me a copy of the Boston "Index". Emerson's Prose Writings
      in Two Volumes is priced $5, but whether $5 each or $2.50 each I cant tell but guess
      $2.50 each. The small volumes [
      <span class="unclear">separately?</span>]
       would cost much more but would be more handy and probably <u>larger print</u>.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I guess the collected  Prose works in two volumes may not contain <u>his last</u> prose writing. Probably his First Essays and English Traits would be best for me
      if I should choose to invest in a small way at first.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Maybe I need not write more now,</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0129">1. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
