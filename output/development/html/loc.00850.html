      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>It was my purpose to write to you while home, but ill health prevented me from
      fulfilling half my plans. I am much better now but by no
      means well. The Comptroller has given me another week of grace in which time I hope
      to
      get well. I have just recd a letter from Benton saying I
      must come and see him and bring you with me.<sup><a href="#loc.00850_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> This is why I
      am writing. Can you not come. If you are in N.Y. surely you can. Benton would be
      delighted; so should I. I shall leave
      go to Benton next Saturday and stay till Wednesday. If you could not come till Monday
      or
      Tuesday even, do so. From N.Y. you will take the Harlem R.R. to Amenia, Dutches Co.
      Benton lives about a mile from there and keeps the Leedsville P.O. If you should write
      direct to Leedsville N.Y. With much love
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Burroughs (1837-1921)
      first met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864, even though
      Burroughs had frequented Pfaff's beer cellar, where he consistently defended
      Whitman's poetry, in 1862. After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman
      commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs
      was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the correspondence between the two
      men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would
      write several books involving or devoted to Whitman's work: <em>Birds and Poets</em>, (New York: Hurd and Houghton, 1877), <em>Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</em> (New York:
      American News Company, 1867), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (Boston:
      Houghton, Mifflin and company, 1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1920). For more information on John
      Burroughs see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837-1921] and Ursula [1836-1917]</a>.
