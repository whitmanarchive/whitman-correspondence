   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00469_n14">1. This letter dates to
      January 17, 1867. Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the letter to the year 1866,
      but Edwin Haviland Miller dated the letter January 17, 1867 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:307, n. 10). The year 1867 is correct because, according to
      the date in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, the letter dates to January 17, a
      Thursday. January 17 fell on Wednesday in 1866 and on Thursday in 1867. Further,
      the letter responds to Walt Whitman's news that Juliet Grayson has died (see his
       letter to Louisa) and
      discusses a January 1867 letter from Charles Heyde.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00469_n16">2. At the time of this letter,
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman was living at 840 Pacific Street near Prospect Park,
      which covered over 500 acres in what is now the center of Brooklyn. The designer
      for the park was Calvert Vaux (1724–1785), and the chief architect was
      Frederick Law Olmsted (1822[?]–1893). Work began in 1859 and continued
      after the interruption of the Civil War. In 1867, when this letter was written,
      the realization of Vaux's design was nearly complete. The park stretched to the
      city's eastern boundary is notable for its Long Meadow, "a classic passage of
      pastoral scenery with gracefully modulated terrain of greensward, scattered
      groves of trees, and indefinite boundaries that create a sense of unlimited
      space" (Charles E. Beveridge, "Olmsted, Frederick Law," <em>American National Biography Online</em>). Joseph Phineas Davis, who shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, her son Edward, and
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman's family, was an engineer at Prospect Park (see
      Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00469_n2">3. Juliet B. Grayson, who lived
      with her mother Mary Mix at 468 M Street North in Washington, D.C., took
      boarders, one of whom was Walt Whitman. Grayson died on January 7, 1867, and
      Walt reported her death to his mother a week later (see his  letter).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00469_n17">4. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      here refers to the abhorrent behavior of Edward B. Grayson, Juliet Grayson's
      husband. According to Walt Whitman's  letter to Louisa, Edward Grayson was "just as bad since his
      wife's death as ever—he gets drunk, &amp; then tries to choke his son
      &amp; daughter, &amp; ends by getting in a fury, &amp; trying to beat every body
      out of the house."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00469_n13">5. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a French-born landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa
      Whitman (1823–1908), Walt Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington,
      Vermont. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive
      letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman often spoke
      disparagingly of Heyde in her letters to Walt: "i had a letter or package from
      charley hay three sheets of foolscap paper and a fool wrote on them" (see her
       to Walt).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00469_n12">6. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Walter Whitman, Sr., and
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Hannah's husband, Charles Heyde, stated that he owed
      $500 on his house, and he acknowledged Walt's gift to Hannah: "Han has received
      two parcels from Walt with two pairs of nice gloves; one 5 dollar greenback; and
      numerous stampd envelopes with your address written upon them; also sufficient
      note paper for several letters. Walter is being kind." The animal that Heyde
      described in his letter was a small brown squirrel, not "a rabbit" (see Charles
      L. Heyde's January 1867 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, Duke University,
      Trent Collection).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">7. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00469_n21">8. The word "he" is unclear.
      The letter "h" in the word "he" is probably written over the letter "i."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00469_n5">9. Walt Whitman and Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman were close friends of the Price family during the years of Walt's
      Brooklyn residence before the Civil War. The Prices also were regular visitors
      to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in the post-war years. The surviving letters from
      Walt to Abby Hills Price (1814–1878) are numerous, and Walt often
      expressed interest in her children, Helen, Emma, and Arthur (another son, Henry,
      had died at 2 years of age). For Walt Whitman's relationship with the Price
      family, especially Abby, see Sherry Ceniza, <em>Walt Whitman and
         19th-century Women Reformers</em> (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press,
      1998), 45–95.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00469_n6">10. The woman that Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman identifies as "mrs wells" was a friend of Emma Price. Louisa
      mentioned Mrs. Wells in connection with another Emma Price visit in her  letter to Walt Whitman. Mrs.
      Wells has not been identified, and it is not known whether she had a connection
      to Samuel R. Wells, a member of the firm that distributed the 1855 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00171_n16">11. Helen Price was the
      daughter of Abby and Edmund Price. Helen's reminiscences of Walt Whitman were
      included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for the
      first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman to
      his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908],
      163–169).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00469_n7">12. Abby Price's remedy for "bad
      spells" is presumably potassium nitrate paper. Medical dictionaries of the era
      recommend the inhalation method that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman describes to
      relieve symptoms of asthma.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00469_n8">13. This postscript appears
      inverted in the top margin of the first page.<br><br>
      Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman (1833–1890) was Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's eighth child. He married Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman in
      February 1859, and they and two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa,
      shared the Pacific Street house with Louisa and her son Edward. Jeff in 1866
      was employed as an engineer at the Brooklyn Water Works, but his career had
      stagnated and did not revive until he was offered the position of chief
      engineer at the St. Louis Water Works in 1867. For a discussion of his
      mental state during this period, which is discernible from phrases in Jeff's
      own letters and informed also by Louisa's observations, see Dennis Berthold
      and Kenneth Price, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.00171.html">Introduction,</a>" <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters
         of Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> (Kent, Ohio: Kent State University
      Press, 1984), 119.<a href="#r13">[back]
