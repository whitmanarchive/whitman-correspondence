      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Nelly,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will just write you a word (for I feel to.) I am feeling well enough to be hopeful—Whether
      it is because I <em>am</em> hopeful—or whether the precursor of health yet, after all—tedious as it is a-coming—this
      deponent cannot swear—but we will think it the latter. 
      I have had a bad week since I wrote you—feel more comfortable to-day. Saw the doctor
      (Grier)
      day before yesterday—he made a careful ausculation of my heart—pronounced it all right
      there—(I have been suffering considerable pain &amp; oppression on left side)—He still
      thinks I will recover—says he is not disposed to recommend galvanism, (though the
      electric business is his specialty)—says he is sure the main trouble is the <em>cerebral</em> anæmia—cure, great care, good surroundings, 
      time &amp; hygiene—arrives, in fact, at the same conclusions as Dr. Drinkard<sup><a href="#nyp.00332_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—(though an entirely different man from Dr. D., a great talker, &amp; very demonstrative)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nelly, you needn't send the photos of my nieces back yet. Keep them a while yet.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nelly, your last letter is very blue, mainly about political &amp; public degradation—Summer's
      death &amp; inferior men &amp;c. being rampant &amp;c—I look on all such states of things 
      exactly as I look on a cloudy &amp; evil state of weather, or a fog, or long sulk meteorological—it
      is a natural result of things, a growth of something deeper, has its uses, 
      &amp; will hasten to exhaust itself, &amp; yield to something better—
   </p>

   <p>Thanks for your letter of 20th—give my love to Mrs. Brownell—</p>
