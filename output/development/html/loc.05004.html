   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="loc.05004_n1">1. Margaret Goodenough
      took care of Whitman's mentally infirm youngest brother Ed, whose board cost
      $16 monthly, an expense which Walt Whitman shared with his brother George
      and his wife Lou, see <em>Daybooks and Notebooks</em>, ed. William
      White (New York: New York University Press, 1977), 2:510.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0285">2. Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908),
      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.05004_n2">3. When Hannah wrote to
      Whitman, he was in New York to deliver his lecture entitled "The Death of
      Abraham Lincoln." He gave the lecture on Thursday, April 14, 1887, and there was
      a reception the following day at the Westminster Hotel.<a href="#r3">[back]
