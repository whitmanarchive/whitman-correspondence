      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr Booth
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Thank you for sending me the volume <em>the Booths</em>—It does
      not furnish me the picture I wanted—(I am very particular &amp; shall not be
      satisfied till I get one that fills the bill)—But the volume is more helpful
      to me (in touches, corrections, guidance &amp;c to my piece) than I can
      describe—&amp; the reading of all about your father, of absorbing
      interest—He was a beautiful character.<sup><a href="#loc.05827_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
