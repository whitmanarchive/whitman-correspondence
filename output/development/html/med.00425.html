   <p>The bad spells in my head continued at short intervals all through Tuesday, Wednesday
      and Thursday.<sup><a href="#med.00425_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> 
      Today there is a sulking sort of lull—have not had any actual blurs, but all the while
      
      ready to have them, and pretty sick and sore and bad, especially in head, confusing
      me, 
      and affecting my eyes. I have rewritten my Will, with some slight changes and additions,
      
      and placed it in the pocket of my trunk here.<sup><a href="#med.00425_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> … Ate my breakfast like a man this morning. I don't go out any.

   <p>Have been reading Dr. Adam's speech before the Evangelical Alliance in today's "Tribune."<sup><a href="#med.00425_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> My eyes gave out before through.

   <p>. . . Charley, I think I fully appreciate my situation and the possibilities and contingencies—and
      honestly think yet I shall come round—that this is a pretty bad flurry, but one which
      will pass over. . . .

   <p>. . . We like the new house.

      The Evangelical Alliance, an international meeting of Protestants who sought
      unity among all Christians, met in New York from October 3–10, 1873. It
      convened to answer the questions raised by the new Catholic doctrines of papal
      infallibility and the immaculate conception of the Virgin, as well as the
      threats posed to Christianity by science and materialism. The <em>Tribune</em>, with unconcealed Protestant zeal, reprinted verbatim
      virtually all the speeches of the delegates.<a href="#r3">[back]
