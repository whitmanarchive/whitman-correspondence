   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="syr.00033_n1">1. Edwin Haviland Miller,
      original editor of Whitman's correspondence, wrote of this letter: "I have
      accepted the authenticity of the note by the first owner (W.A.S.): David McKay
      gave this Autograph to me Oct. 11/88, the day on which it was written &amp;
      recd" (Syracuse). W.A.S. also noted: "The 'plate' mentioned is Walt Whitman's
      portrait as printed in November Boughs. This order is to get the plate to use in
      the Xmas No. of Pubr Weekly of 1888." See <em>Publisher's
         Weekly</em>, xxxiv (November 17-24, 1888), 47.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
