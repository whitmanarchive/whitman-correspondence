      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Han has 
      recd
      
       all of your postals and copy of Camden Paper and Tribune; over report
      of your grand success at Madison Theatre she fairly revels in exultation. She is
      strong enough to go out now, visiting. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I have had a pretty fair success past winter at low prices, but just now there is
      a
      halt. The lake is frozen over yet, and the country roads so impeded that it interrupts
      all
      business. 
   </p>
   
   <p>A new Hotel is opening here, and the proprietor encourages me much, but  I must wait. I
      have not gone behind hand, yet our coal is exhausted, and am in need of colors: I
      have several large and small pictures on hand which I hope to sell toward June &amp; July.
      I would like to go to California
      on trial, yet misgivings intrude at this point, there has been so much disaster— 
   </p>
   
   <p>Could you help me ever so little—send it to Han for my use. My sister has
      assisted me the same—to keep out of debt. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Miller continues his very enthusiastic letters— </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a French-born
      landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman (1823–1890), Walt
      Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_96.html">Heyde, Charles Louis (1822–1892)</a>," <em>Walt
