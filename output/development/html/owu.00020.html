      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The sun shines out bright &amp; cheerful this morning—&amp; in my east window I have 
      a fine healthy rose-bush—I see it has got two roses in bloom, &amp; one just budding out—(it
      was a present from Mrs. Channing<sup><a href="#owu.00020_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> of Providence—she sent on here, 
      and had it got for me, when I was first sick)—I think I am feeling better to-day,
      
      &amp; more like myself—I have been in the habit of soaking my feet in hot water 
      every night for two months now—&amp; I think lately it has done me more harm than good—one
      thing is, it has probably made me catch a slight cold—so I have stopt it, 
      &amp; I have a notion I feel better from stopping it——I have just had my breakfast, 
      &amp; am sitting here alone by the stove, writing this—Charles Eldridge will be here 
      in a few minutes, &amp; bring the morning papers—he comes &amp; sits a few minutes 
      every morning before going to work—he has been very good indeed—he &amp; Peter Doyle hold
      out through every thing—most of the rest have got tired 
      &amp; stopt coming—(which is just as well)—Mrs. O'Connor comes whenever she can, 
      &amp; generally brings a dish of roast apples, or something—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I go over to the office about 12 or 1 most every day——but only for a few minutes—have
      not resumed work there yet, but hope to, Monday—I find there is a great deal 
      of paralysis around, and they say I have got along very well—but it  so slow, 
      so aggravating, to be disabled, so feeble, cannot walk nor do any thing, 
      when one's mind &amp; will are just as clear as ever—Still <u>I</u> <u>feel</u> I shall get 
      as well as usual yet, dearest mother—&amp; then I shall <u><u>surely</u></u> get here or buy 
      or build a little place here, rooms enough to live in for you &amp; Ed and me<sup><a href="#owu.00020_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I realize it more, far more now, than ever—even for my own comfort—this spring is
      better to buy here than usual——I think we could get along <u>very</u> <u>well</u> indeed—you could visit George &amp; Lou as often as you liked (&amp; George &amp; Lou could come
      
      &amp; pay us a visit in winter when Congress is in full blast)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I miss John &amp; Mrs. Burroughs—they are at a place called Waukill, N.Y. state—they
      have hired out their house furnished, 6 mo's, $50 a month. I have not heard 
      any thing further from Jeff<sup><a href="#owu.00020_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I hope to come on soon &amp; pay you all a visit, 
      but wait to see how things go in the office—&amp; how I feel—(as I have been absent now
      nine weeks)—Every thing looks pleasant here to-day—quite spring like—Mother dear 
      I hope this will find you feeling well, &amp; in good spirits, as that is the main thing.
      
      —Mother as I cannot get down to the p.o. I send the money once more enclosed—write
      me Sunday, if convenient—Chas. Eldridge has been in—it is now later, 
      towards 12—I have washed &amp; put on some clean clothes, &amp; am going over to the office—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <p id="owu.00020_n3">3. Encouraged by Whitman's
      references to a home (see the letter from Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      of ), Mrs. Whitman wrote on March
      21: "i think walt when folks get old like you and me they ought to have a home
      of their own" (Trent Collection, Duke University). Mrs. Whitman also informed
      Jeff of her unhappiness at Camden, for on March 30 Jeff reported to Whitman that
      mother "is not quite as happy as when she kept her own house—what do you
      think about it" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). About April 5(?) Mrs. Whitman
      wrote: "well walt i should never have made any complaint if you hadent have
      wrote to me. you should certainly get a place for you and edd and me. i hope you
      may succeed walter. i have not been very happy here but i thought you had
      trouble enough without hearing mine" (Trent Collection, Duke University).
      Meanwhile, George had begun to construct a house in Camden—much too
      elaborate for Mrs. Whitman's tastes. On April 8 she described the house she
      dreamed of: "if we ever build walt which i hope we shall, i dont think it will
      be quite so extensive. the cheapest house that you could build would be a 2
      story house with 2 rooms below and 2 rooms above with a shed kichen with no
      fireplace in the house except in the kichen. . . . what do you think of my plan
      walt. we couldent have many visitors to stay all night" (Trent Collection, Duke
      University).<a href="#r3">[back]
