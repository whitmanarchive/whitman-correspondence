      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I received your letter<sup><a href="#loc.00438_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> in due time. I am indeed glad to hear that you are so well and get along so nicely—We
      are all well as usual—and time slides along as usual—a day or two ago I to[ok] Mat
      and Hattie out on the line for a ride—very pleasant—and Mother said the little one
      was as good as she could be—indeed I think Mother rather likes to have her all to
      herself—When you come on again we must certainly take a ride or two out—The country
      looks splendid—everything is growing as finely as can be
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We had a letter from George a few days ago—Mother tells me that George is wanting
      to get a position as Captain in the regular Army—I have though[t] considerably about
      it and have made up my mind if we all go to work it could be done quite easy<sup><a href="#loc.00438_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Jule Mason<sup><a href="#loc.00438_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> was at my house yesterday and I had a long talk with him about it—he said that just
      now there was no way—as the regulations only admitted officers that had graduated
      at some military school—but said that undoubtedly that in a very short time that objection
      would be removed—he said that he could help us in the matter a good deal and would
      do all in his power with pleasure—he said he (George) ought to go about it at once by getting a <em>good first</em>class endorsement from the officers he had served under—all that he could—and then
      bring what ever other influence he could on the Sec of War and Gen Grant—He said in
      his duties he was brought sometimes (quite often) in such intercourse with Gen Grant
      that he could (and it would come in good too—not far-fetched) speak a recommendation
      for George &nbsp;I spoke with Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00438_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> and he said that he knew very intimately the new senator from California (Bidwell)<sup><a href="#loc.00438_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> and that he was certain he could get him to give his influence to the thing and would
      willingly do anything in his power—And then there is John Swinton<sup><a href="#loc.00438_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> I am sure he would help—perhaps by writing a letter to Stanton<sup><a href="#loc.00438_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—and we ourselves could get Congress man Bergen<sup><a href="#loc.00438_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> to aid the matter—thinking it all over I am sure that if the restriction prescribing
      those not educated in a military school is removed George can get the same position
      in the regular army that he now has—but for God-sake dont let him think of enlisting in the army with the expectation of being promoted &nbsp;that is too dangerous—Will you give the matter
      some attention and see how the matter stands—Mason is stationed in Washingt[on] &nbsp;hunt
      him up and talk the matter over—he can and will help us if we will only make the effort
   </p>
   
   <p>I am going to try all in my power to come on to Washington at the time of the review<sup><a href="#loc.00438_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>—if I can possibly leave I shall come—I want very much to see something that will
      make me remember the war—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother received a letter from you Friday<sup><a href="#loc.00438_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup>—I heard that Worthen<sup><a href="#loc.00438_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup> had sent a letter to you containing $25. did you get it? When you see George give
      my love to him—talk over the matter that I have written abt. and see what he thinks of it. All send their love

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

      the army George attempted, without success, to become a career officer (Jerome
      M. Loving, ed., <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington
         Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975],
      136).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.00438_n5">5. John Bidwell
      (1819–1900), a representative from California, was elected as a Unionist
      to the Thirty-ninth Congress (March 4, 1865 to March 3, 1867). Earlier in his
      extraordinary life Bidwell had crossed the Rockies and Sierras with the first
      overland expedition (1841). In California he became the first man to discover
      gold in the Feather River, the most noted agriculturalist in the state, one of
      the early regents of the university, and an unsuccessful candidate for governor.
      In 1890, he was the Prohibition party candidate for president of the United
      States. Moses Lane and Jeff might have been especially interested in Bidwell
      because he was one of the early proponents of a transcontinental
      railroad.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.00438_n8">8. In the <em>Brooklyn Daily Advertiser</em>, June 1, 1850, Whitman had
      applauded Tunis G. Bergen for various services in the New York legislature and
      for being "a very Cerberus in his watch over the Treasury" (Edwin Haviland
      Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 1:37, n. 1). Jeff worked with the
      congressman's son, Van Brunt Bergen, at the Brooklyn Water Works (see Jeff's
