      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been staying here, at home again, for the last three or four weeks, &amp;
      before returning to London tomorrow I should like to tell you something of my
      doings, which you will be interested in perhaps although quite ordinary. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Before beginning about myself, though,— many thanks for the Lippincott's
      article.—<u>My Book &amp; I</u>, which is full of
      highest import. The 
      par.
      
       at foot of 
      p.
      
       122, stating the metier of <u>Leaves of Grass</u> is
      specially significant. The whole shows unanswerably the tremendous significance,
      indeed, of your poetic standpoint, and I wish I could prevail upon you to embody the
      essential parts of the manifesto, with a touch of redirection for our English
      readers, in a preface in <u>Specimen Days</u>? I may say here  
      that Walter Scott (which means David Gordon really)<sup><a href="#loc.03316_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> will
      send you ten guineas for the right of including the book in the Camelot series, as
      soon as the book arrives. 
   </p>
     
   
   <p>This brings us to Kennedy's book, about whose adventures over here he has no doubt
      kept you informed. At present it is in the hand of Fred. W. Wilson of Glasgow,<sup><a href="#loc.03316_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> who has had it for some time. It is needless to say much
      therefore until Wilson makes some farther move. I must send him another reminder.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>If I had not had special news about you from different of your friends, I should have
      been alarmed at the bad reports circulated here of late. It was as well to let them
      go, seems that they were leading to certain friendly tributes, although they seemed
      to cast a certain imputation on your friends. I was sorry to hear from W.S.K.<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r3">3</a></sup> afterwards that your having been out-of-sorts &amp; without
      appetite had probably been the cause of the rumour in the first instance. May sun
      &amp; seawind move to bring you respite from all further ills of body &amp; soul! 
   </p>
   
   <p>Sun &amp; sea-wind occur peculiarly to me just at present, for in spite of
      winter &amp; storm, these have meant more in the story of my days lately, since
      coming up north here, than perhaps ever before. This is what I wanted to especially
      tell you about. For some time before, I had been working at a sea subject,—"A
      North Sea Interlude," and  so it was natural that I should go down to the sea-shore a good
      deal during my stay in this part. Sometimes in these recent rambles, the sense of
      sun &amp; wind, sea &amp; land, has lifted me into a state of physical &amp;
      spiritual exaltation, that some of the L. of Grass alone in all poetry could at all
      come near expressing. One morning in particular, ten days back, everything seemed
      to move in subtlest harmony with my own pulses. When I set off a wild rain-storm was
      driving in from the south-east, but lo! as I reached the sea sands the sun shone out
      as if consciously, &amp; the movement then of the waves, &amp; the hurrying, superb
      clouds above, formed a symphony, as it were, grandest ever known; a symphony not for
      ears alone, but for all the senses. The fresh salt sea smell, the lances of sunlight
      through the cloud-rack, the steady presence of the sands &amp; rocks &amp; the
      outreaching bastions of a pier; then far away again, the ships passing:— how
      little of it one makes actual in writing!— As a last touch of this music,
      below a densely black mass of cloud that came up threateningly appeared, right on
      the sea, the end of a rainbow, which seemed so preordained, so organic, so much at
      once
       with
      imagination &amp; will, that it was almost as if I had willed it there. So, bathing
      hands &amp; face in one of the waves, I came away, with a sense of something new
      having come into life &amp; thought. In attempting to tell this, all the intimate
      spirit of that hour has eluded my words, but you will read into them what they lack,
      I know! Many other like excursion have made these days memorable for ever. How I
      wish I could shew you some of these North sea scenes, 
      so stormy &amp; turbulent, but so touched with the great peace &amp; harmonising advent of
      the divine
      sun!—then, two or three days ago, I went over to Browney Valley, to see my old
      friends the coal-miners &amp; farmers there. The dominant feeling of the years spent
      in that quiet countryside came back to me then very strangely. One evening (last
      Saturday) I talked over <u>Leaves of Grass</u> with a few of the
      younger fellows, &amp; this gave a keynote to all my doings more or less. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I'm afraid it is not made very clear after all about all these things, &amp; why I
      should trouble you with them. But I want you to feel that as I go on I am getting
      more into harmony with the universe &amp; with men moving in its environment, &amp;
      so may help more &amp; more to carry out the great idea of Leaves of Grass. Believe
      this, of yours most affectionately 
   </p>

   <p> I wish you would send me a postcard or a pencil scribble, anything to say how
      your are, &amp;c. now &amp; again.

      Could you<sup><a href="#loc.03316_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>  spare me a couple of portraits similar to that prefixed to Kennedy's book?—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03316_n1">1. David Gordon was a
      bookbinder who was appointed the managing editor of The Walter Scott Publishing
      Company based in London and Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Although he had little
      education, the Scottish editor soon became a driving force in the company's
      success, creating some of its most well-known editions, such as the Canterbury
      Poets Series, the Camelot Classics Series, the Great Writers Series, and the
      Contemporary Science Series. Whitman's 1886 English edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> was published by Scott and advertised by Rhys as
      Whitman's entry into the "Canterbury Poets" series.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03316_n2">2. Frederick W. Wilson was a
      member of the Glasgow firm of Wilson &amp; McCormick that published the 1883
      British edition of <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">3. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
