   </p>
   
   <p>I am in receipt of your kind letter. The portrait of yourself we have given in the
      English Edition of "Poems" will be superseded by one from the very fine photograph
      
      wch
      
       Mr. Moncure Conway<sup><a href="#n0170" id="r1">1</a></sup> has lent me to be engraved. Should our <u>second</u> attempt not be satisfactory, I will cheerfully
      avail my self of your offer.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr. Swinburne<sup><a href="#n0610" id="r2">2</a></sup> was very pleased to hear that his mention of  yourself and literary 
      labours
      
       had given satisfaction. He is now busy upon <u>"Bothwell"</u>—a new poem 
      wch
      
       may be regarded as a sequel to his <u>"Chastelard"</u>.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am a little puzzled as to a good agent for the sale of our English selection from
      your "Poems" in America. Any suggestions you may make will be thankfully
      received.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pray excuse the hasty scrawl—hasty to catch the post.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Camden Hotten
      (1832–1873) printed Swinburne's <em>Poems and Ballads</em>
      when another publisher withdrew after the book caused a furor. Perhaps because
      he had lived in the United States from 1848 to 1856, Hotten introduced to an
      English audience such writers as Robert Lowell, Artemus Ward, Oliver Wendell
      Holmes, and Bret Harte. After his death, his business was purchased by Chatto
      and Windus. In his letter to Conway on December 5, 1866, O'Connor had suggested
      Hotten as the English publisher of Walt Whitman: "Seems to me the courage that
      prints Laus Veneris might dare this" (Yale).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0170">1. Moncure Daniel Conway (1832–1907) was an
      American abolitionist and frequent correspondent with Walt Whitman. Conway often
      acted as Whitman's agent and occasional public relations man in England. For
      more on Conway, see Philip W. Leon, ""<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_182.html">Conway Moncure Daniel (1832–1907)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998), 148.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0610">2. Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) was a
      British poet, critic, playwright, and novelist. He was also one of Whitman's
      earliest English admirers. At the conclusion of <em>William Blake:
         A Critical Essay</em> (1868), 300–303, Swinburne pointed out
      similarities between Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly
      Rocking" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the
      most sweet and sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world." His
      famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America" is included in <em>Songs
         before Sunrise</em> (1871). For the story of Swinburne's veneration of
      Whitman and his later recantation, see two essays by Terry L. Meyers, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00740.pdf">Swinburne and Whitman: Further Evidence</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 14 (Summer 1996), 1–11 and "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00902.pdf">A
         Note on Swinburne and Whitman</a>," <em>WWQR</em> 21 (Summer
      2003), 38–39.<a href="#r2">[back]
