      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter this morning. It is too bad you don't get my letters 
      Tuesday, as I send them in ample time Monday—they are in the p. o. here by noon, 
      &amp; the mail don't close till about 6 p. m.—then the letters get in 
      New York by ½ past 5 Tuesday morning—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have had very hot weather—I thought about you—it is quite oppressive 
      on me this summer—still I get along quite well—get along pretty well nights—but every
      time the middle of the summer comes round, I think I will never stay 
      through another summer in Washington, if I can help it—
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>Saturday noon</em>—<em>11th</em>—We are having a very hot day—How do you all like the nomination of Seymour and Blair?<sup><a href="#duk.00651_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      It is a regular old Copperhead Democratic ticket, of the rankest kind—probably pleases
      the old democratic bummers around New York and Brooklyn—but every where else they
      take it like a bad dose of medicine—the democrats are dissatisfied here, the worst
      kind—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>O'Connors have had quite a serious falling out with Mrs. Burroughs<sup><a href="#duk.00651_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—John is away yet—may call upon you on his way home.<sup><a href="#duk.00651_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Mrs. B. is a curious woman—but has been very kind to me—Of course you mustn't let
      on that you know any thing—only you might mention to him that 
      I often write about the wife's &amp; his kindness to me—but probably it is doubtful if
      he calls—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I am sitting here by my window in the office—I dont have the smell of any
      streets or gutters—but it is burning hot, 
      &amp; hardly any air stirring—fortunately we have moderate nights—&amp; so I manage to get
      along—
   </p>
   
   <br><br><span class="dateline">Monday morning 13th</span>
   
   
   <p>It still keeps hot, &amp; no rain—I was up at O'Connor's a while last evening—Ellen O'Connor
      is quite sick—has a bad attack of dysentery—the rest are all well—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing decided yet about who shall be attorney General<sup><a href="#duk.00651_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—every thing goes on as usual in the office—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, mother, I must close—it is now a little after 10—there is a pleasant breeze
      blowing in from the river, quite refreshing—Good by for the present, &amp; love to you
      &amp; all, mother dear.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00651_n1">1. Whitman refers to Horatio
      Seymour (1810–1886), former governor of New York, and Montgomery Blair
      (1813–1883), Postmaster General in Lincoln's administration.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00651_n2">2. In January 1868, William
      Douglas and Ellen O'Connor occupied rented rooms in John and Ursula Burroughs'
      new house; see Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> (New
      York: Macmillan, 1955), 391. On ,
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman asked Walt Whitman about Ursula North Burroughs
      (1836–1917): "how does mrs 
      Oconor
      
       and she get along. mrs. 
      Oconor
      
       thought they would not perhaps." Louisa Van Velsor Whitman alluded to
      the rift between the O'Connors and the Burroughs on : "i suppose it makes you feel 
      awkard
      
       to go to Mr 
      Oconors
      
      , their not being friendly and you being friendly to both but when they
      [the O'Connors] move it will be different. its very 
      disagreable
      
       to live in one house and not be on speaking terms."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00651_n3">3. According to Clara
      Barrus, John Burroughs visited Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in late June 1868 (<em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin Company, 1931], 57).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00651_n4">4. Orville Hickman Browning
      was still acting Attorney General.<a href="#r4">[back]
