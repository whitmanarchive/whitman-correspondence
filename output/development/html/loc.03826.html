      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thanks for your postal card<sup><a href="#loc.03826_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>, we are always so glad when
      we come down to breakfast and find something there with your good black hand
      writing—so unlike anybody else's. As I wrote you<sup><a href="#loc.03826_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> the books came safely to hand
      and
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>are greatly appreciated by our friends who ordered them.<sup><a href="#loc.03826_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      And that splendid complete volume<sup><a href="#loc.03826_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> you sent father<sup><a href="#n4979" id="r6">6</a></sup>—that is a book! You know how to get out such nice
      editions—there is no one who has nicer ones.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have just been having a party of about a dozen young people staying with us to
      help in an "opera" which we wrote and performed last Saturday. It was about
      Oxford,
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>showing how some women-students got possession of a man's college and turned the men
      out. But alas, when the women were once in they began quarreling—some wishing
      to be serioes and study, S some to have a good time &amp; in the end they all
      eloped with a handsome undergraduate and the men got back their college. It was very
      amusing—my part was to dance a ballet, which I
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>did, in full ballet costume.</p>
   
   
   <p>We have had a lovely summer here all together, with visits from lots of
      friends—each of whom has brought some interesting word with him.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In a week now I go back to Oxford—to Balliol College, for my last year. It is a
      dear place. I shall hate to leave it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>all send love</p>

      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
