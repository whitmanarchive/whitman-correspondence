      <br></br><br></br>Mr Walt Whitman
      <br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have since learned that you called at the "DeSoto"
      immediately after I had left. I remained there till 6:30 P.M. &amp; thinking that you
      were prevented calling by another engagement, I left for home. I would be happy to
      meet
      you at any time you may be pleased to appoint. In company with Capt Holbrook I invited
      a
      gentleman, who has a relativeâ€”a prisoner of war at Camp Chase, Ohio. he is
      desirous of obtaining the name of some Captains, an order to obtain his exchange, by securing the release
      of the Captains. Your brother's name was given &amp; the party promised to act upon it
      immediately. I can say nothing of its results.
   </p>
   
   <p>Several of my brother officers are desirous of obtaining a copy of "the Reconnysance" by
      Capt Sim's. &amp; I would esteem it as a great favor, if you would enclose it, in a
      letter &amp; send it to my address. I will assure you of its being returned in good
      order.
   </p>
   
   <p>You will please accept a copy of my Ca[illegible] accounts in exchange for
      your own. With every
      assurance of respect I remain
   </p>

      this letter traditionally has been attributed to Dana F. Wright, based on
      Wright's signature. Descendants of Wright as well as military roster and census
