      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy Jack,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.02582_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I thought of coming round to see you all last Sunday, but it was so hot &amp; I didn't
      get over to Camden—didn't feel like walking up from the ferry—Jack I am stopping up
      here in 22d street for a week or two—they are very kind to me, &amp; very jovial &amp; we
      have real good times—the young man, about 21,<sup><a href="#loc.02582_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> he &amp; I are very thick—then there are two grown daughters—the eldest one is a <u>first</u> <u>class</u> <u>trump</u>, she is my favorite every way—she is studying at the woman's Medical University here—the
      mother Mrs Gilchrist, is a very fine lady,—we have good meals, &amp; take our time over
      them—I have the best room in the house, breezy &amp; cool (&amp; the water in it)—&amp; a young
      English college Professor, Mr Carpenter, is staying here for a few days—though a stranger
      he is a great friend of mine &amp; indeed has come over from England to see me—(But I
      have written enough of all that—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Dear Jack I wonder if I shall ever be with you, or rather have you with me, so that
      we can have some good times together on land or water—I used to think of having a
      shanty of my own there in Camden, &amp; I thought I shouldn't be satisfied without having
      you &amp; Ida up there to take supper with me <u>two evenings</u> in the week at least—I wonder if it is ever coming to pass—
      
      Mean time I shall come around <u>next Sunday</u>, if you are all at home—Tell Ida to put her hair in curl papers Saturday night—&amp;
      though I do not wish the fatted calf slaughtered on Sunday morning—<u>I hope there will be some spear mint ready to pull in the garden</u>—Johnny how does it go with you?—Love to mother &amp; father &amp; tell 'em I'm coming round
      next Sunday—Here is a kiss for you, Jack, &amp; take care of yourself, &amp; don't forget
      your loving friend

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02582_n1">1. According to Walt
      Whitman's notation on Jack Johnston's calling card, the young man was employed
      about this time by A. R. McCown &amp; Co., a hosiery store in Philadelphia (see
      the letter from Walt Whitman to John R. Johnston, Jr. of February 18, 1878). Later he was employed by Ziegler &amp; Swearingen,
      sellers of notions in Philadelphia (<em>The Commonplace Book</em>,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). In Jack's autograph book Whitman wrote
      in 1875: "In memory of the good times, Sunday evenings, in Penn street, 1875,
      '4, &amp; 3." On January 18, 1880, he wrote again: "Good times, Sunday Evenings,
      continued, '76, '77, '78, '79, &amp;c. W W" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
