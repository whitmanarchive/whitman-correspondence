   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00557_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Edward Carpenter | Commonwealth Café | Scotland Street | Sheffield England.
      It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | May 3 | 12 M | 87.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00557_n2">2. Carpenter's letter of
       had the awe-stricken and confessional
      tone characteristic of Whitman's youthful admirers: "Dear old Walt—I was
      right glad to get your card and find you hadn't forgotten me; and that you still
      keep going along, fairly cheerful." Carpenter went on to relate: "I have had a
      baddish time the last few days, and feel tired out &amp; sick. A very dear
      friend of mine—we have been companions day &amp; night for many months
      now—has taken to girl whom I can't say I much care for. . . . Just now I
      feel as if I had lost him, and am rather dumpy—tho' I don't know that it
      will be altogether bad in the end." Whitman received £25 from Carpenter on May
      23 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="uva.00557_n3">3. Whitman often visited the
      family at their farm at Timber Creek in Laurel Springs, New Jersey; in the
      1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby Glendale.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0590">4. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
