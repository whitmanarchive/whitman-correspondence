      <br></br>Gentlemen:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The check for $60. arrived safely this morning. Please consider this a receipt
      for said sum.<sup><a href="#nyp.00265_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received, some ten days since, the six proof-impressions of the <em>Carol</em>—&amp; am much obliged. (No copies of magazine.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I forward herewith another poem for the <em>Galaxy</em>. If acceptable,
      please, after correcting, let me have a good proof in time.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The right of publishing <em>Ethiopia Commenting</em>,<sup><a href="#nyp.00265_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> in
      future book, is reserved to me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The price of the piece is $25.</p>
   
   
   <p>I have, in composition, an article, (prose,) of some length—the subject
      opportune—I shall probably name it <em>Democracy</em>. It is
      partly provoked by, &amp; in some respects a rejoinder to, Carlyle's <em>Shooting Niagara</em>.<sup><a href="#nyp.00265_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> I think it might be
      specially appropriate to your purposes &amp; scope. I would propose it to you for a
      leading article for January '68 <em>Galaxy</em>. Please write me how
      the idea suits you. Or, as I am coming to Brooklyn in a few days, perhaps I may as
      well call personally, &amp; get your notions about it.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00265_n1">1. William Conant Church
      (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
      York newspapers until he founded the <em>Army and Navy
         Journal</em> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
      he established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. Financial control of
      the <em>Galaxy</em> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
      was absorbed by the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1878. William
      published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
      Francis wrote for the New York <em>Sun</em> the unsigned piece
      "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." See Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the
      <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952),
      332–350; Donald N. Bigelow, <em>William Conant Church
         &amp;</em> "The Army and Navy Journal" (New York: Columbia University Press,
      1952); J. R. Pearson, Jr., "Story of a Magazine: New York's <em>Galaxy</em>, 1866–1878," <em>Bulletin of the New York
         Public Library</em>, 61 (1957), 217–237, 281–302.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00265_n4">2. 
      This payment was compensation for "A Carol of Harvest, for 1867," a poem Walt
      Whitman submitted to the <em> Galaxy</em> in his  letter to William Church.<br><br>
      For images and a transcription of the poem as it appeared in the September
      1867 edition of the <em>Galaxy</em>, see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00192.html">"A Carol of Harvest, for 1867"</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]

      published in the <em>Galaxy</em>. It later became "Ethiopia
      Saluting the Colors"; see Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952), 337. Whitman
      withdrew the poem in his  letter
      to Francis Church.<a href="#r3">[back]

      After?" (<em>Macmillan's Magazine</em>, 16 1867: 319–336).
      Whitman's piece was published in the December issue. See Grier, "Walt Whitman,
      the <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952),
