   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>This letter is addressed to three
      close acquaintances of Whitman: William Sloane Kennedy (1850–1929), the
      naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921), and the Canadian physician Richard
      Maurice Bucke (1837–1902). For more on these figures, see these entries
      from <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998): Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John (1837–1921) and Ursula (1836–1917)</a>," and

   <p id="med.00813_n1">1. This letter is endorsed by
      Kennedy: "Joint letter to Kennedy | Burroughs &amp; Bucke."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00797_n1">2. This is referring to
      Whitman's lecture entitled "The Death of Abraham Lincoln." He first delivered
      this lecture in New York in 1879 and would deliver it at least eight other times
      over the succeeding years, delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He
      had published a version of the lecture as "Death of Abraham Lincoln" in <em>Specimen Days</em> (1882–83). For more on the lecture,
      see Larry D. Griffin, "'Death of Abraham Lincoln,'" <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, ed.,
      (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998), 169–170.<a href="#r2">[back]

      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
