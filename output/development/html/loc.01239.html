      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I had yours of 3 Aug<sup><a href="#loc.01239_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—acknowledging receipt of
      draft. Sorry to hear you were troubled with sunstroke. I hope you are going on
      pretty well again now. We were very pleased that the money came in handy—I
      haven't been in London lately or seen Mrs. Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r2">2</a></sup> or 
      yr.
      
       friend Mary (?) Whittall<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> whom you mention. I
      rather expect to be that way in about a month or so. Am laid up just now with a kick
      from my horse—luckily nothing very bad—he struck me (accidentally in  a way—the
      kick being probably meant for another horse that was teasing him) just above the
      knee on the front of the thigh—so no bones broken, but it is a big bruise and
      it will be a week or two before I can get about. It is wonderful though how nature
      sets to work directly to put things right, and it has been peaceable &amp; free from
      pain. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I have plenty to do looking over proofs—I am bringing out a 2nd edition, enlarged, of Towards Democracy—also a
      criticism of Modern Science 
      wh.
      
       I am interested in &amp; hope it will provoke some discussion—it is
      a direct attack on the validity of scientific  'laws' &amp; methods
      generally—not that I don't think Science has been very useful, but that it is
      time that it should 'climb down' a bit. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Do you see anything of yr young friend McKinsey<sup><a href="#n3106" id="r4">4</a></sup> or has he left Philadelphia? I send you
      a photo I had taken a little time ago with a young fellow who is an old friend of
      mine—in Sheffield—it is not very good of me, though very fair of 
      'tother
      
       one. 
   </p>
   
   <p> The farm gets on—slowly—but still it moves, and I rather expect in a few
      months to put it on a distinct cooperative footing. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p> Prices are awfully low—owing apparently to the general depression and the fact
      that the <u>mass of the people</u> are without money—also
      perhaps, partly to a growing scarcity of gold. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Isabella Ford<sup><a href="#loc.01238_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> has had an accident since we wrote, but I do not know exact particulars.
      She was driving with her Mother &amp; the ponies ran away— Isabella climbed out,
      probably thinking she cd render some assistance, &amp; fell, hurting her
      shoulder. However, she was much better when I last heard. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Hope you keep going pretty well—I often think of you &amp; wish we could have
      a chat. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0259">2. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">3. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
