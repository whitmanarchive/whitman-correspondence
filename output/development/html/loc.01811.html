      <br></br><br></br>My dear sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I send by this mail the second part of my study of your works. I hope I may not <u>unintentionally</u> have misrepresented you, but if I could be
      one of the means of drawing more general attention to your great  works than they have
      yet received in this country, I believe I should have done 
      somet'g
      
       worth the doing.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>May I venture to hope I may have a line from yourself when you have time? And may
      I
      again repeat the hope I expressed to you in a former note when I sent you my own vol. of poems—the
      first—of which I am rather ashamed of
      now—on account of its Byronism—&amp; too much leaven of aristocracy
      which is born with me—<u>that you will not visit this
         country without coming to us?</u>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours with much respect
      <br></br>&amp; in all sincerity
      <br></br>Roden Noel
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>I want to get hold of the American Ed. of your work—which was lent me by
      Buchanan but I understand it is difficult to procure.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The proclamation of <u>comradeship</u> seems to me the
      grandest and most momentous fact in your work &amp; I heartily thank you for
      it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Walt Whitman Esq</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Roden Noel (1834–1894) was an
      English poet. Noel came from an aristocratic English family, and in his youth
      developed socialist sympathies. He was a close friend of the poet and
      influential critic Robert Buchanan, and it may have been through Buchanan that
      Noel first encountered <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In 1871 (the same
      year that he first wrote to Whitman). Noel published an essay entitled "A Study
      of Walt Whitman" in <em>The Dark Blue</em> (Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in England</em> [Ithaca, NY: Cornell University
      Press, 1934], 147–149).
