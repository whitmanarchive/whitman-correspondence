   <p>Your note has just come to hand, stating that you intend a visit to Washington, &amp;
      desire a situation. My friend, if that is your sole object here, &amp; you depend
      upon any thing of that kind, (unless you have some special friend who has great
      influence, or offices at his disposal,) I seriously advise you against any such
      enterprise. I myself have no influence at all, being a mere clerk, &amp; of low
      grade—&amp; our office is in confusion—the Attorney General having
      yesterday resigned his place<sup><a href="#hun.00056_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—&amp; it being very probable that the
      rest of the cabinet will follow before long. They are discharging many of the
      Department employes, &amp; appointing none. For some months to come, indeed for the
      ensuing year, every thing will be unsettled &amp; in suspense here—<sup><a href="#hun.00056_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing new with me—nor in our family.</p>
