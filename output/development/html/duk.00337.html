      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We have just received orders to cook three days rations and be ready to march immediately
      &nbsp;I beleive the whole of the 9th Army Corps are ordered to report at Fortress Monroe. If so I
      suppose we will march to Aquia Creek, and go on board of Transports &nbsp;My own oppinion
      is that Burnside<sup><a href="#duk.00337_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> is to collect a force at Fortress Monroe, and start off again on his own hook with
      a sepperate command. I wrote you a few days since,<sup><a href="#duk.00337_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> to send home for Mother to send you $20 by express and for you to bring it, when
      you came down here. Of course you will keep it, untill we get to some place where you can either send it by express or bring it yourself.
      We will probaly stay somewhere around Fortress Monroe for some time, if so you can take a run down
      there and see me, &nbsp;I will write you as soon as we get there. I have my house nearly
      finished, and was going to have a nice warm place. Capt Sims<sup><a href="#duk.00337_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> left here yesterday for home on a leave of absence for 10 days. I was going to apply
      as soon as he came back and was makeing lots of reckoning of going home for a few days, but I suppose there will be no getting away now for some time.
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt, I have not received the letter you sent with the money, nor have I received
      any letter from you since the 27th of Jan. I wish you would write home telling them
      that we are going to leave here, as I dont know that I shall get a chance to write before we start. I will write to them as
      soon as we get to Fortress Monroe or wherever we may go. The mail is about closeing so I must stop. Good bye for the present
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      (1824–1881) organized at the outbreak of the war the First Rhode Island

   <p id="duk.00337_n3">3. Samuel H. Sims, a captain
      in George's Fifty-first New York Volunteer Regiment, had been the subject in
      part of Walt Whitman's article, "Our Brooklyn Boys in the War," which appeared
      in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, on January 5, 1863. Sims
      died on July 30, 1864, of wounds received near Petersburg, Virginia (see George
      Washington Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from ). Walt Whitman may have lived in
      Sims's tent during part of his stay at Falmouth, Virginia, opposite
      Fredericksburg—a trip that Walt took in search of George after reading his
      brother's name in the <em>New York Herald</em> listed among the
      wounded in the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862. As it turned out,
      George only suffered a minor injury; George wrote in a letter to his mother on
      : "I have come out safe and
      sound, although I had the side of my jaw slightly scraped with a peice of shell
      which burst at my feet."<a href="#r3">[back]
