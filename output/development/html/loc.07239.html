   <p>I have heard from Wm Gurd.<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r2">2</a></sup> All goes
      well in N.Y. except that our lawyer has been sick, he is better and the work of
      taking out the patents will go on now with all convenient speed. Cannot tell <u>yet</u> positively when I shall go East but rather expect
      sometime next week. There is no doubt Dr Osler<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r3">3</a></sup> thinks you are doing well or he would be over oftener, if he
      thought you failing or very ill he would not neglect you I am sure. He is an
      exceptionably able man and we must admit
      (whatever we may think or feel) that he knows as much about your condition as any
      one does (including yourself).  I do not hear good accounts of your present nurse (Musgrove)<sup><a href="#loc.07239_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> 
      and I have just written to Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r5">5</a></sup> about a
      young man whom I can freely recommend who is willing to go from here and take the
      place.
      His name is Edward Wilkins,<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r6">6</a></sup> I know you would like him, he is a
      real good, nicelooking young fellow, I have known him some years—he is as
      good as he looks. I expect to hear from Horace at once on this business—I hope
      you will approve of the change, I am sure you will be pleased with it when made.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4284">2. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="n4302">3. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on
      Osler, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitman-dev.unl.edu/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_202.html">Osler, Dr. William (1849–1919)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.07239_n2">4.  W. A. Musgrove replaced Dr.
      Nathan M. Baker as Whitman's caregiver on July 15, 1888. Musgrove was far less
      satisfactory than Baker. Traubel noted that "Musgrove is a cloudy man. I asked
      how M. got on. W. evaded the question by some general remark. . . . He
      [Musgrove] is only a nurse—not a doctor" (Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.2.html">Monday, July 16, 1888</a>). Yet, Whitman later described Musgrove as
      "kind active &amp; considerate all through" (See the letter from Whitman to
      Bucke of .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">5. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="n4319">6. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r6">[back]
