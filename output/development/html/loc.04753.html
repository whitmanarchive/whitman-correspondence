      <br></br><br></br></span><span>My dear and honoured Walt Whitman:—
      
   </p>
   
   <p> It is less than a year ago that I made your acquaintance so to speak, quite by
      accident, searching among the shelves of a bookstore. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I was attracted by the curious title "Leaves of Grass", opened the book at random,
      and my eyes met the lines of "Elemental Drifts" 
   </p>
   
   <p> You then and there entered my soul, have not departed, and never will depart. </p>
   
   <p> Be assured that there is at least one (and I hope there are many others) who
      understands you as you wish to be understood; one, moreover, who has weighed you in
      the balance of his intuition and finds you the greatest of poets. 
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>To a man who can resolve himself into 
      subtile
      
       unison with Nature and Humanity as you have done, who can blend the soul
      harmoniously with materials, who sees good in all and o'erflows in sympathy toward
      all
      things, enfolding them with his spirit: to such a man I joyfully give the name of
      Poet:— the most precious of all names. 
   </p>
   
   <p> At the time I first met your work, I was engaged upon the essay which I herewith
      send you. I had just finished "Decadence". In the "Spring Song" and the "Song of the
      Depths" my orbit responded to the new attracting sun.<sup><a href="#loc.04753_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p> I send you this essay, because it is your opinion of it above all other opinions
      that I should most 
       highly value.
      What you may say in praise and encouragement will please me, but sympathetic surgery
      will better please. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I know that I am not presuming, for have you not said:— "I concentrate toward
      them that are nigh."—"will you speak before I am gone? will you prove
      already to late?" 
   </p>
   
   <p> After all,—words fail me, in writing to you. Imagine that I have expressed to you
      my
      sincere conviction of what I owe. 
   </p>
   
   <p> The essay is my "first effort," at the age of 30. I, too, "have sweated through fog
      with linguists and contenders" I, too, "have pried through the strata, analyzed to
      a
      hair", searching for the basis of a virile and indigenous 
       art. Holding on
      in silence to this day, for fear of foolish utterances, I hope at least that my words
      may carry the weight of conviction. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Trusting that it may not be in vain that I hope to hear from you, believe me, noble
      man, affectionately your distant friend, 
   </p>
