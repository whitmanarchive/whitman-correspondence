      <br></br>Washington, <br xmlns="" class="opener">February 17, 1868. 
      <br></br><br></br>My dear Conway,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of February 1st has just come to hand. I am willing that Mr. Hotten
      should sell his English publication of my Poems in the United States, on condition
      of paying me one shilling on every copy disposed of here—&amp; hereby give
      consent to that arrangement.<sup><a href="#col.00001_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      Furthermore, to save trouble, I hereby fully empower you to decide &amp; act for me
      in any matters or propositions relating to the book, in England, should any such
      arise—&amp; what you agree to is agreed to by me. If convenient I should like
      Mr. Hotten to send me two copies of the book, by mail, immediately. I should also
      consider it a special favor if you would forward me from time to time any of the
      English magazines or journals that might contain <em>noteworthy</em>
      criticisms of my poems. But you must allow me to repay you the favor.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>William O'Connor is well, and remains employed as before. Ellen O'Connor<sup><a href="#col.00001_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> is
      absent in Providence, but returns soon—their little daughter has been very
      ill, but is now convalescing.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Our American politics, as you notice, are in an unusually effervescent
      condition—with perhaps (to the mere eye-observation from a distance) divers
      alarming &amp; deadly portending shows &amp; signals. Yet we old stagers take things
      very coolly, &amp; count on coming out all right in due time. The Republicans have
      exploited the negro too intensely, &amp; there comes a reaction. But that is going
      to be provided for. According to present appearances the good, worthy,
      non-demonstrative, average-representing Grant will be chosen President next fall.
      What about him, then? As at present advised, I shall vote for him non-demonstrative
      as he is—but admit I can tell much better about him some five years hence.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I remain well &amp; hearty—occupy the same quite agreeable &amp; quiet berth in
      the Attorney General's office—and, at leisure, am writing a prose piece or
      two, (which I will send you, when printed.)<sup><a href="#col.00001_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I wish to send my sincerest thanks &amp; personal regards to Mr. Rossetti. To have
      had my book, &amp; my cause, fall into his hands, in London, in the way they have, I
      consider one of the greatest pieces of good fortune.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr. Morley<sup><a href="#col.00001_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> called upon me. Did you get my piece I sent, "Democracy"? I have just
      received a letter from A. B. Alcott<sup><a href="#col.00001_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—he was with Mr. Emerson the previous evening, talking. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Remember my request to Mr. Hotten for a couple of copies by mail—also, by your
      own kindness, any English criticisms of value should such appear.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have not yet seen the February Fortnightly<sup><a href="#col.00001_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—nor the book William Blake—but shall procure &amp; read both. I
      feel prepared in advance to render my cordial &amp; admirant respect to Mr.
      Swinburne—&amp; would be glad to have him know that I thank him heartily for
      the mention which, I understand, he has made of me in the Blake.<sup><a href="#col.00001_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Indeed, my dear friend, I may here confess to you that to be accepted by those young
      men of England, &amp; so treated with highest courtesy &amp; even honor, touches one
      deeply. In my own country, so far, from the organs, the press, &amp; from
      authoritative sources, I have received but one long tirade of shallow impudence,
      mockery, &amp; scurrilous jeers. Only since the English recognition have the skies
      here lighted up a little.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>With remembrance &amp; love to you, Rossetti, &amp; all my good friends—I
      write, for the present, Farewell.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Moncure Daniel Conway (1832–1907) was an
      American abolitionist and frequent correspondent with Walt Whitman. Conway often
      acted as Whitman's agent and occasional public relations man in England. For
      more on Conway, see Philip W. Leon, ""<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_182.html">Conway Moncure Daniel (1832–1907)</a>," <em>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="col.00001_n1">1. In accepting Hotten's
      proposal as outlined in Conway's letter, Walt Whitman carefully repeated the
      agreement. Conway reported that Hotten informed him that "when expenses are
      paid, you will have a percentage on each copy sold here" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.; Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.56.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996],
      2:284).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="col.00001_n2">2. Whitman responded to the
      news of Ellen M. O'Connor's return from Rhode Island on .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="col.00001_n3">3. Walt Whitman was
      preparing "Personalism" for the <em>Galaxy</em>. In his  letter, Whitman asked Conway to
      handle the English publication of the work.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="col.00001_n4">4. 
      John Morley (1838–1923), a statesman as well as a man of letters, was
      editor of the <em>Fortnightly Review</em> from 1867 to 1882.
      He had visited Walt Whitman in February; see Morley's <em>Recollections</em> (1917), 2:105. Morley replied on  that he could not print Walt
      Whitman's poem ("Thou vast Rondure, Swimming in Space") until April: "If
      that be not too late for you, and if you can make suitable arrangements for
      publication in the United States so as not to interfere with us in point of
      time, I shall be very glad." Unaccountably, the poem did not appear in
      print.<br><br>
      On , Conway had written a note
      introducing John Morley; see also Whitman's  letter to Morley.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="col.00001_n5">5. Walt Whitman was
      misleading: A. Bronson Alcott wrote on . See Whitman's 
      letter to Alcott.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="col.00001_n6">6. On , Conway called Whitman's attention
      to his review of Swinburne's book on Blake in the <em>Fortnightly
         Review</em>, 9 (1868), 216–220.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="col.00001_n7">7. Swinburne, at the
      conclusion of <em>William Blake: A Critical Essay</em>, pointed
      out similarities between Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle
      Endlessly Rocking" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he
      termed "the most sweet and sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the
      world" ([London: John Camden Hotten, 1868], 300–303). Included in <em>Songs before Sunrise</em> (1871) was his famous lyric "To Walt
      Whitman in America." For the story of Swinburne's veneration of Walt Whitman and
      his later recantation, see Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in
         England</em> (Cornell: Cornell University Press, 1934),
      103–121.<a href="#r7">[back]
