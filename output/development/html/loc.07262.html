   <p>I have your letter of 31st and card of 1st gave the first lecture of the course
      yesterday morning—a demonstration of the brain—cerebral stabis—the next will deal
      with cerebral dynamics (what grand names we give to our various
      ignorances!).<sup><a href="#loc.07262_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Ed. Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r3">3</a></sup> is to leave London 11.30 this a.m. ought to reach you tomorrow forenoon—let
      me know if he has got to Camden and how you like the looks of him? Not a word yet
      from Wm Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r4">4</a></sup>—it is too
      bad—I do not know what to expect, may get a letter tomorrow wanting me to go
      East at once or may not be wanted for weeks yet—only thing is to exercise what
      philosophy one has—and wait. No doubt he is more or less in the dark himself. I wish you would
      find out the <u>name</u> of that Paris review<sup><a href="#loc.07262_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> which had a paper
      on L. of G. if I had name and date or even <u>name</u> could soon
      get it.

   <p>Weather here very pleasant now though still showery—We are all well.</p>
   
   <p>Your big book<sup><a href="#n6137" id="r6">6</a></sup> seems to rather drag. No doubt it will be ready by the time I get East
      and you must give me a copy then.
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall write again in a day or two &amp; hope I shall be able to be more definite in
      the re Eastern trip for I must <u>hear</u> from Wm Gurd soon surely

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> le
