   <p>Cloudy now the third day—Nothing very new—my little poemet (welcoming
      Brazil republic) return'd from Harper's Weekly rejected<sup><a href="#loc.07734_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I am feeling fairly—the <em>suspicion</em> (not at
      [all] decided) of fairer strength continued—the bad weather however has kept
      me in the last four days—rest &amp;c: last night satisfactory—rare fried
      eggs, Graham bread, stew'd prunes &amp; tea for my breakfast—am sitting here
      (same, same old story) in the big rocking chair alone in den—the elder of the
      two young sailor men, Harry Fritzinger, has just been up to see me—I like the
      two fellows, &amp; they do me good (his brother Warren<sup><a href="#loc.00668_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      is my nurse)—I sent you "the American" with the notice of Sarrazins<sup><a href="#n3115" id="r4">4</a></sup> book in it<sup><a href="#loc.07735_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Send me word if
      you get the bundle safe—the Boston <em>Transcript</em> has
      printed a good little notice of the <em>Compliment</em> wh' I have
      given to Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r6">6</a></sup>, as he likes to collect all such—I
      enclose Mrs: O'C[onnor]'s<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r7">7</a></sup> card just rec'd<sup><a href="#loc.07735_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup>—She has in view to get an appointment as woman

      pubrs have issued a little livraison of favorable criticisms—&amp; sent me
      one—Shall I send it to you? or have you rec'd one? I send another piece ab't
      Dr Sequard<sup><a href="#loc.07735_n4" id="r10">10</a></sup>—it is just past noon &amp; I am ab't having my currying.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07734_n2">2. Whitman sent the poem
      (later entitled "A Christmas Greeting") to Foord of <em>Harper's
         Weekly</em> and asked $10. When it was rejected, he sent the manuscript on
      December 4 to S. S. McClure (see his 
      letter to Bucke), who paid $11 and printed it in <em>McClure's
         Magazine</em> on December 25 (<em>The Commonplace-Book</em>,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839-1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.00668_n4">3. Frederick Warren Fritzinger
      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,
      535).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n3115">4. Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935)
      was a translator and poet from France, who commented positively not only on
      Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and
      apparently liked the critic's work on <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>—Whitman even had Sarrazin's chapter on his book translated
      twice. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      translator.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n4267">6. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="n4137">7. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

      hormone replacement therapy (Michael J. Aminoff, <em>Brown–Sequard: An Improbable Genius Who Transformed Medicine</em>,
