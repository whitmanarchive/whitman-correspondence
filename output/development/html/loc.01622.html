      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete, dear son,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am sitting here in my room again writing to you—there is no particular change 
      in the situation—we are having some pretty cold weather here—I go out a little 
      every day, but my walking does not improve any—I had a partially bad spell 
      yesterday afternoon, &amp; did not go out, but it passed over, &amp; to-day I feel 
      as well as I usually have lately—I shall get out this afternoon, &amp; over to the 
      Reading room in Philadelphia—(Looking over the papers, I see occasionally very 
      interesting <u>news</u>, about myself—a paper in Salt Lake, Utah, had me dead,—&amp; the Philadelphia <u>Item</u>, about the same time, had me at a public dinner, 
      in Phil. making a speech.) I rec'd your last. I suppose you got mine last Tuesday—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I have just had my dinner, bean soup, boiled beef, &amp; pumpkin-pie, all good—so you
      see I might be doing worse—it is now just after 2, &amp; I am feeling 
      quite comfortable—&amp; hope this will find you all right, my loving boy—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
