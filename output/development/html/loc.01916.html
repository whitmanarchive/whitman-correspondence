      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Being totally without news from you since January this year I began to fear, that
      you may be severely ill; else I presume, that you would have let me hear from you,
      at least by papers and little parcels as ordinary I wrote to you in April a fortnight
      before my marriage. If the letter should not have reached you, I hereby
      
      
      tell you, that of the 14,th May I married my dear faithfull little wife, to whom I have been betrothed since inne years. I am a living example of the old sentence, that [
      <span class="unclear">riches?</span>]
       are no ingredient of happiness.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If you have dearly received my letter from April, you will know, that I have made
      vain and to myself very humiliating efforts to arrange a demonstration in favour of
      you among the [
      <span class="unclear">labor?</span>]
       of Copenhagen
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My thoughts were with on the 4th. Your name [
      <span class="unclear">most?</span>]
       surely [
      <span class="unclear">has?</span>]
       the best glamour to be memorable at "the Centennial"; most probably it has not been
      [
      <span class="unclear">it?</span>]
       at all.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think to write another about George Washington. Should you know one good <u>memoirs</u> and relations of contemporaries about the Anglo-American work?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My dear wife is greeting you as a friend. Your kind earnest [
      <span class="unclear">face?</span>]
       is looking
      
      on us in this moment from our wall.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Tomorrow I dare reach the age of forty years!</p>
   
   
   <p>I should be glad if these lines may meet you in good health and good [
      <span class="unclear">laughs?</span>]
