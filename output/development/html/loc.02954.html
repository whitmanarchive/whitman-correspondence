      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman:—
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>I long,—and have lang syne &amp; every day longed—to know some details
      of 
      yr
       
       days now. For some reason Mr Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r1">1</a></sup> has never seen
      fit to tell me any thing about your daily doings—whether you sit up or whether
      you are prone on 
      yr
      
       back. It is cruel to keep a fellow ignorant. Can't you tell me in a line or
      two yourself? Thank you for the magazine—"Bookmaker"—with its picture of 
      you. Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> has sent me a proof of what seems to me
      the best of the two photogravures of Mrs Gilchrist.<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      <u>I prize it highly.</u>
       Any news from
      <u>the three</u>—Bucke,<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> O.'C.<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r5">5</a></sup> or J.B.?<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I am reading with tremendous interest &amp; absorption (by bits as I get time)
      Scott's<sup><a href="#n4277" id="r7">7</a></sup> best novels again, &amp; looking up all the hard
      Scotch words in Jamieson's Dictionary.<sup><a href="#loc.02954_n1" id="r8">8</a></sup> They have made my summer glorious. My love of
      that man is something strong as fate. Indeed I believe the ties of blood draw me to
      him &amp; Scotland—my "forbears" being Scotch-Irish (on one side). I am now
      revelling in the "Antiquary" wh. I opine to be the healthiest &amp; most humorous of
      all, perhaps.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4267">1. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">2. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0259">3. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">5. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">6. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4277">7. Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832)
      was a Scottish statesman, historical novelist, playwright, and poet, best known
      for <em>Ivanhoe</em> (1820), <em>The Lady of the
         Lake</em> (1810), and <em>Waverly</em> (1814). For more on
      Scott, see Vickie L. Taft, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_209.html">Scott, Sir Walter (1771)–1832)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="loc.02954_n1">8. The Reverend John Jamieson
      (1759–1838) published his <em>Etymological Dictionary of the
         Scottish Language </em>in 1809 and 1810.<a href="#r8">[back]
