      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter &amp; George's came safe—dear brother George, one dont more than get a letter from him before you want to hear again, especially as things
      are looking pretty stormy down that way—but, mother, I rather lean to the opinion
      that the 51st is still in Kentucky at or near where George last wrote,<sup><a href="#loc.00794_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> but of course that is only my guess—I send George papers often &amp; occasionally letters—mother,
      I sent him enclosed your letter before the last, though you said in it not to tell
      him how much money he had home, as you wanted to surprise him, but I sent it—Mother,
      I think Rosecrans &amp; Burnside will be too much for the rebels down there yet—I myself
      make a great acc't of Burnside being in the midst of <em>friends</em>, &amp; <em>such</em> friends too—they will <em>fight</em> &amp; fight up to the handle &amp; kill somebody—(it seems as if it was coming to that pass
      where we will either have to destroy or be destroyed)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I wish you would write soon after you get this, or Jeff or Mat must, &amp; tell
      me about Andrew, if there is any thing different with him—I think about him every
      day &amp; night. I believe I must come home even if it is only for a week—I want to see
      you all very much—Mother, I know you must have a good deal to harrass &amp; trouble you, I dont mean about Andrew personally, for I know you would feel to give your life to save
      his, &amp; do any thing to nourish him, but about the children &amp; Nancy—but, mother, you
      must not let any thing chafe you, &amp; you must not be squeamish about saying firmly
      at times not to have little Georgy<sup><a href="#loc.00794_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> too much to trouble you (poor little fellow, I have no doubt he will be a pleasanter
      child when he grows older) &amp; while you are pleasant with Nancy, you must be sufficiently
      plain with her—only, mother, I know you will &amp; Jeff &amp; Mat will too be <em>invariably</em> good to Andrew, &amp; not mind his being irritable at times, it is his disease, &amp; then
      his temper is naturally fretful, but it is such a misfortune to have such sickness,
      &amp; always do any thing for him that you can in reason—Mat, my dear sister, I know you
      will, for I know your nature is to come out a first class girl in times of trouble
      &amp; sickness, &amp; do any thing—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, you dont know how pleased I was to read what you wrote about little sis,<sup><a href="#loc.00794_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I want to see her so bad I dont know what to do, I know she must be just the best young one on Long Island—but I
      hope I will not be understood as meaning any slight or disrespect to Miss Hat, nor
      to put her nose out of joint, because Uncle Walt I hope has heart &amp; gizzard big enough
      for both his little neices, &amp; as many more as the Lord may send—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I am writing this in Major Hapgood's office as usual—I am all alone to-day—Major
      is still absent, unwell, &amp; the clerk is away somewhere—O how pleasant it is here,
      the weather I mean, &amp; other things too for that matter—I still occupy my little room
      394 L st., get my own breakfast there, had good tea this morning, &amp; some nice biscuit,
      (yesterday morning &amp; day before had peaches cut up)—My friends the O'Connors that
      I wrote about re-commenced cooking the 1st of this month, (they have been as usual
      in summer taking their meals at a family hotel near by.) Saturday they sent for me
      to breakfast &amp; Sunday I eat dinner with them, very good dinner, roast beef, lima beans, good potatoes &amp;c. They are truly friends to me—I still get my dinner at a
      restaurant usually. I have a very good plain dinner, which is the only meal of any
      acc't I make during the day, but it is just as well, for I would be in danger of getting
      fat on the least encouragement, &amp; I have no ambition that way.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, it is lucky I like Washington in many respects, &amp; that things are upon the
      whole pleasant personally, for every day of my life I see enough to make one's heart
      ache with sympathy &amp; anguish here in the hospitals, &amp; I do not know as I could stand
      it, if it was not counterbalanced outside—it is curious—when I am present at the most
      appaling things, deaths, operations, sickening wounds (perhaps full of maggots), I do not
      fail, although my sympathies are very much excited, but keep singularly cool—but often,
      hours afterward, perhaps when I am home, or out walking alone, I feel sick &amp; actually
      tremble, when I recal the thing &amp; have it in my mind again before me—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, did you see my letter in the N Y Times of Sunday Oct 4?<sup><a href="#loc.00794_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> That was the long delayed letter—Mother, I am very sorry Jeff did not send me the
      Union with my letter in<sup><a href="#loc.00794_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I wish very much he would do so yet, &amp; always when I have a letter in a paper I would
      like to have one sent—if you take the <em>Union</em>, send me some once in a while—Mother, was it Will Brown sent me those? tell him if
      so I was much obliged, &amp; if he or Mr &amp; Mrs Brown<sup><a href="#loc.00794_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> take any interest in hearing my scribblings, mother, you let 'em read the letters
      of course—O I must not close without telling you the highly important intelligence
      that I have cut my hair &amp; beard—since the event, Rosecrans, Charleston, &amp;c &amp;c have
      among my acquaintances been hardly mentioned, being insignificant themes in comparison—Jeff,
      my dearest brother, I have been going to write you a good gossipy letter for two or
      three weeks past, will try [to] do it yet, so it will reach you for Sunday reading—so
      good bye, brother Jeff, &amp; good by for present, Mother dear, &amp; all, &amp; tell Andrew he
      must not be discouraged yet—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00794_n1">1. George's previous letter
      was written on , from Camp
      Nelson, near Hickman's Bridge, Kentucky.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00794_n2">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      had complained of Andrew's son on September 3(?), 1863: "georgie is so cross, he
      aint a nice child at all" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare
      Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00794_n3">3. About October 5, 1863,
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman described Jeff's new baby as "fat and prettyer than
      hatty," and earlier in the same letter complained that Mannahatta was "very
      obstropdous" (Trent Collection).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00794_n4">4. "Letter from Washington,"
      dated October 1, 1863, appeared in the <em>New York Times</em> on
      October 4; reprinted in Emory Holloway, ed., <em>The Uncollected
         Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman</em> (Garden City, New York: Doubleday,
      Page and Company, 1921), 2:29–36. This letter is typical of Whitman's
      newspaper correspondence—chatty, discursive, and informal. Whitman described the
      Capitol and various Washington sights; only one section, "Army Wagons and
      Ambulances," was topical. Burroughs termed the article "one of the finest pieces
      of writing I have ever seen" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1931), 13).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.00794_n6">6. The Browns lived for five
      years with the Whitmans on Portland Avenue, Brooklyn. He was a tailor. Relations
      between the two families were sometimes strained; see Whitman's letter from . On June 3, 1865 (Trent Collection),
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman informed her son that she was glad to move away from
      the Browns.<a href="#r6">[back]
