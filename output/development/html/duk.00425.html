   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."
   </p>

<div class="editorial_notes">
   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00425_n1">1. The date "March 1863" on the
      letter in the hand of Richard Maurice Bucke is accurate, but the letter can be
      dated a more narrow range, to between March 9 and March 14, 1863. The letter
      followed Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's  letter to Walt, which reported George Washington Whitman's
      arrival in Brooklyn on "Sunday morning" (March 8) for a ten-day furlough. George
      departed from Brooklyn the morning of March 17, the day his furlough ended (see
      George's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman). In this letter, Louisa refers to Jeff's letter and twice asks Walt to
      send the flannel shirts. She could have written no earlier than the same day as
      Jeff's letter, March 9. If she expected the shirts to arrive before George's
      expected departure from Brooklyn, she must have written no later than March 14.
      This date range is confirmed also by Walt's  letter to Jeff, in which he reported having sent a packet with
      George's shirts on March 15, 1863. Louisa's letter likely was not written on
      neither end of the possible extremes, so between one day after Jeff's letter
      (March 10) and four days before George's departure (March 13) is most likely as
      the date of the letter.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n8">3. Walt Whitman sent a packet
      with "George's shirts, drawers, &amp;c" via Adams Express on March 15, 1863 (see
      his  letter to Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman). Adams Express, a packet delivery service, was noted for its fast
      delivery, trustworthiness, and its guarantee of privacy for shippers (see Hollis
      Robbins,"Fugitive Mail: The Deliverance of Henry 'Box' Brown and Antebellum
      Postal Politics," <em>American Studies</em> 50:1/2 [2009],
      12–13).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n4">4. Fort Monroe, located on the
      southernmost tip of the Virginia Peninsula, remained under Union control
      throughout the Civil War. George Washington Whitman, whose Ninth Army Corps unit
      had been encamped at Newport News, Virginia before his ten-day furlough in early
      March, hoped to receive the shirts in Brooklyn before his March 17 return to the
      encampment near Fort Monroe (see George's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman). The blue flannel shirts
      were probably sewn by Louisa's daughter-in-law Martha "Mattie" Whitman, the wife
      of George's brother Thomas Jefferson Whitman. Robert Roper has traced the many
      references to these flannel shirts in the Whitman family's early 1863
      correspondence (see <em>Now the Drum of War</em> [New York: Walker
      and Company, 2008], 204–6).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n11">5. In a  letter to Walt Whitman, Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman reported George's arrival in Brooklyn. During the Civil
      War, Jeff was employed as a civil engineer for the Brooklyn Water Works. Jeff
      eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
      recognized name. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n10">6. This letter is written on
      paper of very low quality. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in another letter on the
      same paper expressed her frustration: "this 12 sheets of writing paper for 4
      cents is awful stuf to write on" (see her  letter to Walt Whitman). The passage of 150 years has proven that
      the paper is "awful stuf" on which to preserve a letter: it is slowly crumbling
      away at edges and folds. To arrest the deterioration, a conservator at Duke
      University has stabilized the document with backing, which is visible in the
      reproduction. Many crumbled fragments are also preserved. Many words could only
      be recovered from the letter itself by reassembling the document from a small
      envelope of crumbled fragments. However, a typed transcription for each letter
      is available in a two-volume manuscript album, <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Extensive Collection of Holograph Manuscripts Written to Walt Whitman by
         His Mother Mrs. L. Whitman</em> (Trent Collection). According to Will
      Hansen, Assistant Curator of Collections at Duke University Library, the
      manuscript albums and transcripts were prepared by a previous owner in the early
      twentieth century. For this letter, portions of the text that were still legible
      when the manuscript album was prepared in the early twentieth century have been
      recovered from the type transcript.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">7. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n15">8. Porter has not been
      positively identified, but he was probably a member of George's regiment, the
      51st New York Volunteers. The National Park Service Soldiers and Sailors
      Database lists three men named Porter in George's regiment: Thomas, a chaplain,
      George A., a first lieutenant, and George W., also a first lieutenant.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n14">9. Matilda Agnes Heron
      (1830–1877), an actress, was a famous interpreter of Alexander Dumas' <em>Camille</em>and of Ernest Legouvé's <em>Medea</em>, both roles that she adapted for the stage. See George C. Odell,
      <em>Annals of the New York Stage</em> (New York: Columbia
      University Press, 1928), 6:534–6.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n20">10. Louisa wrote the descender
      of the letter "p" separately. Here she neglected to add the descender, which
      makes the word appear more like "verhaps."<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n16">11. Walt Whitman in his  letter to Jeff Whitman reported a
      "bad humming feeling and deafness, stupor-like at times, in my head." Olive oil
      or "sweet oil," which Louisa Van Velsor Whitman recommended, was a common
      treatment for the removal of ear wax in the nineteenth century.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00467_n1">12. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n17">13. The individual letters in
      this word most closely resemble "frour," a nonsense reading, so Louisa may have
      intended "floor" or "from." If the word is "floor," it completes the phrase
      "fire on the same [floor]," reporting Charles Heyde's assertion about Hannah's
      comfort in her Vermont home. If the word is "from," it marks a transition
      between Heyde's words and what Hannah, her daughter, wrote. Though the phrase
      "from she wrote" is not idiomatic, the reading "from" is more probable because
      the passage that follows reports the portion of the letter written by
      Hannah.<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n6">14. Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975), 10–11.<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">15. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r15">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n7">16. "Sis" is Manahatta "Hattie"
      Whitman (1860–1886), the elder daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman
      and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven
      years of her life in the same home as Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was especially
      close to her grandmother. The nickname "Sis" would eventually pass from
      Manahatta to her younger sister Jessie Louisa, the latter born in June 1863.
      Hattie and Jessie were both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r16">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n18">17. Andrew Jackson Whitman
      (1827–1863) was Walter Whitman, Sr., and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son
      and Walt Whitman's brother. In the early 1860s, Andrew worked as a carpenter,
      and he enlisted briefly in the Union Army during the Civil War (see Martin G.
      Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 10 [Winter 1993],
