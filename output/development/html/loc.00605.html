   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00605_n2">1. Bethuel Smith had written to Whitman on
      , from the U. S. General
      Hospital at Carlisle, Pennsylvania: "I left the armory hospital in somewhat of A
      hurry." He expected, he explained on , to rejoin his regiment shortly, and was stationed near
      Washington when he wrote on . He
      wrote on , from Culpepper,
      Virginia, that he was doing provost duty, and on , he was in a camp near Mitchell Station, Virgnia,
      where "the duty is verry hard." He was wounded again on June 11, as his parents
      reported to Whitman on , was
      transported to Washington, and went home on furlough on July 1. He returned on
      August 14 to Finley Hospital, where, on , he wrote to Whitman: "I would like to see you verry much, I have
      drempt of you often &amp; thought of you oftener still." He expected to leave
      the next day for Carlisle Barracks to be mustered out, and on , he wrote to Whitman from
      Queensbury, New York. Smith was one of the soldiers to whom Whitman wrote ten
      years later; see Whitman's letter to Bethuel Smith from December 1874 (Edwin
      Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 2:318–319).<a href="#r1">[back]
