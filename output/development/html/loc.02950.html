   <p>I some weeks ago devised a cunning scheme for getting a call, or visit from you in
      spite of yourself, &amp; at same time putting a couple of hundred dollars into your
      pocket. Shortly after you had 
      yr
      
       sun-stroke I went in &amp; called on O'Reilly,<sup><a href="#n4973" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; asked
      him if we 
      cd
      
       not manage to call the attention of some good government friend of 
      yrs
      
       to the amazing fact that the deserving veteran of the war has never rec'd
      from an ungrateful country any 
       adequate <u>quid pro quo</u>, for his services. (I thought—there
      might be some office for you, with nominal services, wh. you might accept)
   </p>
   
   <p>O'Reilly during the conversation said he wished we could get you on to Boston to
      lecture or read about October 1st or 5th (say). I took up the idea &amp; having my time
      at my disposal, I am going to work you up a lecture. Have seen Bartlett (T.H.)<sup><a href="#n4959" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; only await a letter from you to start me off advertising &amp;
      printing tickets &amp; seeing the Papyrus<sup><a href="#n4320" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; other club men, &amp;c &amp;c.
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you think you will be able to come by that time, my dear friend? I have never
      heard you either read or lecture &amp; shall be a thousand times repaid for my
      trouble.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02950_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | Camden | N. Jersey | 328 | Mickle St. It is postmarked: Belmont |
      AUG | 28 | MASS.; CAMDEN, N.J. | AUG | 29 | 8AM | 1888 | REC'D.<a href="#r1">[back]

      Ralph Waldo Emerson's formality.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4973">3. John Boyle O'Reilly
      (1844–1890) was a fervent Irish patriot who joined the British Army in
      order to sabotage it. He was arrested and sentenced to be hanged in 1866. Later
      the decree was altered, and O'Reilly was sent to Australia, where he escaped on
      an American whaler in 1869. In 1876 he became the coeditor of the Boston <em>Pilot</em>, a position which he held until his death in 1890.
      See William G. Schofield, <em>Seek for a Hero: The Story of John
         Boyle O'Reilly</em> (New York: Kennedy, 1956). For more on O'Reilly, see
      also the letter from Whitman to James R. Osgood of .<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n4959">4. Truman Howe Bartlett
      (1835–1923), an instructor in modelling at the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology, was characterized by William Vaughan Moody as "a magnificent old
      goat and man of God . . . passing hours with immortal phrases"; see Hermann
      Hagedorn, <em>Edwin Arlington Robinson</em> (New York: Macmillan,
      1938), 254. Bartlett evidently affected the Whitman pose with his open collar
      and flowing tie. On , Bartlett
      informed Whitman that "the cast of your hand I shall soon send to Paris to be
      cast in bronze." The plaster cast is in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.; a bronze cast is at Yale. Probably
      Whitman met Bartlett at the poet's close friend Colonel John R. Johnston's home
      on September 1, 1878 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r4">[back]

      Bowery. A Reminiscence of New York Plays and Acting Fifty Years Ago," appeared
      in <em>November Boughs</em> (1888), along with his "Fancies at
      Navesink" poems, one of which ("Last of Ebb, and Daylight Waning") Kennedy
      refers to here.<a href="#r6">[back]
