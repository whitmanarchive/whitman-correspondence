      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of the twelfth just 
      rec'd
      
       was very glad to hear from you.<sup><a href="#uva.00363_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>There is some mistake about 
      Peters
      
       letters I have received four or five from him, no fear of your "photo" not
      reaching here, wish you had have sent it I would like very much to have yours also
      
      Peters
      
       if you have a double one of yourself &amp; 
      Peters
      
       I would like to have that if not why stir Pete up and make him send me his
      you send yours also,
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yes you may [illegible] you
      &amp; I down in your log [illegible] two good
      friends (Even if one old &amp; one young as you say).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I supposed by 
      Petes
      
       letters that he was as gay as usual, but guess the boy is coming to his
      senses and thinking about settling down in life and is going to benefit by the
      numerous opportunities which he has, How does he &amp; the widow pull together now,
      I suppose 
      Ile
      
       find you &amp; Pete in the same box when I return to Washington.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose there is gay times at 
      Met'n
      
       &amp; 
      Canturbury
      
       halls, <u>[
         <span class="unclear">Moses?</span>]
         </u> but I wish I was there with you old Covies
      for a while, never mind 
      Ile
      
       be back very soon now, think 
      Ile
      
       stay here till  August or September then will come home for a month at least if not to stay there
      altogether 
      Ive
      
       got a grand chance here with some young 
      Lady
      
       whose 
      Pa
      
       happens to have some spare cash think he would settle up pretty lively
      should I take one of his 
      Daughters
      
      . He is the American Consul for this place so you see there's no knowing
      how it may turn out, I am having quite a nice time among the 
      Elite
      
       of this place 
      Ive
      
       just joined the Sons &amp; Sisters of Temperance "British Lodge" &amp; am
      making fine progress, Rode the cussed Goat last night &amp; feel quite stiff over
      it, [illegible] I wish
      you could have heard me speechifying for them you know 
      Everyone
      
       has to do that who joins. They wanted me to give them a recitation but
      twas no go unless they would take that familiar old piece of 
      Peters
      
       (Something about the man who could not get his chimney up high 
      Enough
      
       to keep his neighbors <em>Thomas</em> cats from putting out
      his fire) Ha Ha, That would have been fine but the girls up this way are very modest
      so I got off quite an <u>
         Elaborate
         
         </u> address in which I expressed my 
      Phellow
      
      
      [
      <span class="unclear">Phelinx?</span>]
       to the best
      of my abilities &amp; wished the cause of  Temperance Everlasting progress &amp;
      Said I supposed that in the course of a few more years I hoped there would be no
      such thing as Intemperance, (was interrupted with "hear" "hear" and any amount of
      cheering &amp; in the midst of the cheering I brought my speech to a mighty sudden
      close &amp; sat down the hero of the 
      Evening
      
      . Hows that for a Lager beer imbiber Eh, guess it makes you open your 
      Eyes
      
       somewhat. I am still improving in health getting more blooming 
      Every
      
      
      
      Day
      
       people who saw me on my way here &amp; who have been here within last
      month did not recognize the pale youth who passed them last summer. 
      Ime
      
       as strong as a buck Eat as much hash &amp; porridge as usual.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      Ime
      
       going to surprise you all when I do come home none of you will know it
      Just to see if you will recognize the Boy who left Washington some time ago 
      Ive
      
       got over my home sickness &amp; am I suppose as hard  hearted as the rest of humanity when 
      theyve
      
       left home for the first time determined to enjoy themselves to their
      utmost but for all that there's no place like home as the song goes.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received several challenges from several young 
      Ladies
      
       here, through some very flattering valentines with 
      Something
      
       like this inscription on them. "A hand" with "If you can get will you
      accept" quite a nice thing but as it came from wrong quarter why I didn't
      accept.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So 
      Ile
      
       beg you to 
      Excuse
      
       this writing which is done in a very big hurry as I have made an 
      Engagement
      
       to go out 
      Driving
      
       in 
      Sleigh
      
       with "Her" &amp; the time is 
      Drawing
      
       near a head So 
      Ile
      
       close sending you &amp; Peter much 
      Love
      
      .
   </p>
   
   
   <p>PS Tell Pete 
      Ile
      
       answer his as soon as 
      rec'd

   <p>Well Walt 
      Ive
      
       just returned from that ride I mentioned I was away about twenty miles
      on the Blue Mountains of Cape Breton had gay time, 
      Saw
      
       any amount of Indians of Mickmac Tribe. I've promised that young 
      Lady
      
       to show her your picture so you will not 
      Disappoint
      
       me. Today I received two papers from Pete I suppose. "Sunday Chron"
      &amp; Balto Sun.

   <p>No more at present</p>
