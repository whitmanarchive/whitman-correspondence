      <br></br><br></br>Dear Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>(If you will permit me to drop the "Mr.")—I write in some haste. Yours of 26 
      Jan.
      
       &amp; 11 
      Feb.
      
       received.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Ever since we in England heard that your health had
      received a serious shock, we have had it much at heart, I aſsure you, to
      testify our love, respect &amp; gratitude, in some tangible shape: &amp; I 
      c.d
      
       at this moment tell you of at least 3 several plans 
      wh.
      
       were actively mooted, &amp; partly started. Our ideas on the subject have shifted according to
      the varying accounts that reached us, more especially with regard to the material
      comforts of your present mode of life. As the extract 
      wh.
      
       you send me from the West Jersey Preſs, &amp; 
      wh.
      
       you vouch for as leſs strong than the facts, proves that some more
      cheerful preceding accounts were not accurate, there are some of us who 
      w.d
      
       really be glad to exert ourselves to the extent of our moderate means, to
      prove that we are not insensible of the obligations we owe you. 
      Profr.
      
       Dowden of Dublin, &amp;
      myself, have more especially been in frequent written communication 
       on this subject,
      &amp;, if I hear from you in terms to warrant, my so doing, I shall call the
      attention of others to the subject.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Meanwhile Mrs. Gilchrist &amp; I agreed on the 25th that we 
      w.d
      
       at once ask you to oblige each of us with copies of your forthcoming books
      to the value of £5 (25 dollars, I believe this is) each. This morning I saw
      about getting the requisite letter of credit for the amount, £10, &amp; it will
      no doubt be procured &amp; transmitted to you very shortly. I 
      c.d
      
       not find any suitable locality nearer than New
      York mentioned in the Bank documents.—Mrs. 
      G.
      
      
      
      w.d
      
       wish her books to be copies of the Two  Rivulets <u>only</u>.
      I 
      sh.d
      
       wish for The Two Rivulets, &amp; also the forthcoming edition of your
      poems, in whatever proportions may be most convenient, &amp; suitable for making up
      the £5.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I sent the substance of the West Jersey Preſs article to the Academy, but regret
      to find the Editor not forward to publish it: if he fails, I will send it elsewhere.
      Will also lose no time in offering for publication the poem &amp; prose-matter 
      wh.
      
       I read with great interest. I trust I may succeed in all these points.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Arthur Clive (so Dowden informed  me long ago) is really Standish O'Grady, an Irish barrister of
      good position (or good prospects, I forget which). As it happens, I have not yet
      seen his article.
   </p>

      With love
      <br></br>Yours
      <br></br>W. M. Rossetti
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Dowden has mentioned to me your "Autograph Edition," but without defining what it
      is, nor do I precisely know. It sounds tempting, &amp; I hope Mrs. Gilchrist
      &amp; I may come in for some specimen of it.

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
