      of the rheumatism this winter
      untill  a week or so ago i got
      quite lame in my knees so i
      could hardly get down
      stairs but i think i took cold
      going out to the privy getting
      my feet damp as the water
      stands in the path nearly all the
      time but every thing must
      be kept so scientific here
      i dont  know sometimes how
      it is i hope there will never
      
      
      be any thing to annoy or
      disturb the manager i think
      sometims  a person can be
      to particular Lou aint  so nice
      about any thing but the appearance

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00622_n2">1. This letter dates to March
      17, 1873. The letter bears no date in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, aside
      from her statement that she wrote on Monday. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the
      letter mid-March, and it is probably the letter that Edwin Haviland Miller dated
      only to March 1873 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:370). A more exact date can
      be determined from numerous contextual clues. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had
      received Manahatta "Hattie" Whitman's  letter and echoed some of its language in this letter to Walt
      Whitman. She had also received Walt's  letter). Mid-March 1873 is also consistent with Louisa Orr Haslam
      Whitman's trip to Philadelphia, with George Washington Whitman's prospect of
      Brooklyn work, and with his plan to start building a house on the lot at 431
      Stevens Street. The only Monday that conforms to all of these contextual matters
      is March 17, 1873.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n3">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n6">3. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00622_n11">4. A few days later Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman wrote that her son George Washington Whitman "aint like to get
      the brookly [<em>sic</em>] work" (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman). However,
      George again traveled to Brooklyn on March 24 for the "prospect of getting the
      brooklyn work" (see Louisa's  letter
      to Walt).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00622_n13">5. George Washington Whitman
      was building a larger house on a corner lot at 431 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey (see Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975], 31). Louisa first reported George's purchase of the lot in her  letter to Walt Whitman, and she
      described George's plans for the house in her  letter to Walt.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00622_n15">6. After his paralytic stroke
      in January 1873, Walt was confined to bed and then to his room for several
      weeks. He reported that he was improving "very slowly indeed." See his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00622_n9">7. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. His wife Martha
      Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman died on February 19, 1873, from complications
      associated with a throat ailment. Jeff married Mattie in 1859, and Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman had shared their Brooklyn residence until Jeff departed in 1867
      for St. Louis, where he became Superintendent of Water Works. He eventually
      became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00622_n5">8. See Manahatta "Hattie"
      Whitman's (1860–1886)  letter
      to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Feinberg Collection, Library of Congress). Hattie
      was the elder daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven years of her life in
      the same home with Louisa Whitman, was especially close to her grandmother.
      Hattie and her younger sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957) were both
      favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00622_n12">9. Manahatta "Hattie" Whitman
      had written, "It seemes like a dream for this past three weeks Grandma." See her
       letter to Louisa Whitman
      (Feinberg Collection, Library of Congress).<a href="#r9">[back]
