      <br></br><br></br>Dear William O'Connor
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of 5th 
      rec'd
      
       &amp; welcomed.<sup><a href="#nyp.00439_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> To keep you posted I
      make notes at random of this Osgood affair, &amp; send herewith.<sup><a href="#nyp.00439_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I have an article <em>A Memorandum at a
         Venture</em> 5 or 6 pages signed by my name in the forthcoming June number <em>North American Review</em>, which, although hastily written &amp;
      eligible to great additions, I consider a sort of rallying point or key note to my
      position in the <em>Children of Adam</em> business—will be out
      probably 12th to 15th of May—I shall have some proof copies, &amp; will send
      you two or three soon as I get them—(It is a paid for contribution, my own
      price given)<sup><a href="#nyp.00439_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—the newspapers specially like to have
      something <em>up at the moment</em>—this <em>
         N A
         
         
         
         Rev.
         
         </em> piece might give a current reason-why for your
      article—commencing by alluding to it<sup><a href="#nyp.00439_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>The skeleton-facts of the Osgood publication are these. Osgood &amp; Co. wrote to me
      last May ('81) asking about a new &amp; complete edition &amp; suggesting that they
      were open to proposals. I wrote back that a new &amp; complete edition was
      contemplated but I wanted it distinctly understood that not a line was intended to
      be left out or expurgated—that the book must be printed in its entirety &amp;
      that those were prerequisites opening to any negotiation.<sup><a href="#nyp.00439_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> They wrote back asking me to send the copy. I sent it. In a few days they wrote
      me that they would publish it. The bargain was closed. I was to have 12½ per cent
      on
      the sales, and the contract was to run ten years. I went on to Boston (Sept.
      '81)<sup><a href="#nyp.00439_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> and saw the book through the press—pub
      last of Nov. '81—(I think [some?] 3000 must have been published by them since
      then.)<sup><a href="#nyp.00439_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>In their penultimate letter (a month or so ago) Osgood &amp; Co: wrote me that the
      pieces the District Attorney specially &amp; absolutely required to be entirely
      expurgated were <em>To a Common Prostitute</em> and <em>A Woman Waits for Me</em>—those left out the rest could be arranged
      without trouble, &amp; he would allow the publication to continue—<em>but the leaving out of those two pieces was
         indispensable</em>.
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall write you again, dear friend, as any thing occurs or suggests itself that
      I
      think you ought to know bearing on this matter—I am well as usual
      now—after a pretty bad month of illness—but mainly getting along pretty
      well &amp; in good spirits considering—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00439_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answd May 9/82." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service Bureau |
      Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Camden | May | 7 | 6 PM | N.J.; Washington,
      D.C. | May | 8 | 4 AM | 1882 | Recd.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00439_n2">2. O'Connor's letter is
      apparently lost.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00439_n3">3. The "notes" begin in the
      second paragraph.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00439_n4">4. The price asked was $25
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00439_n5">5. On  O'Connor informed Whitman that he needed no
      excuse for the article he was writing for the <em>New York
         Tribune</em> (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, ed. Sculley Bradley [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania
      Press, 1953], 4:331).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00439_n6">6. See the letter from
      Whitman to James R. Osgood of .<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00439_n7">7. Whitman was slightly
      inaccurate: he arrived in Boston on August 19, 1881 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00439_n8">8. Probably Whitman
      overstated the number of copies printed by Osgood. In a letter to the poet on
      , John H. Johnston quoted from a
      note he had received from the publisher, who had "printed three editions, 2000
      copies in all." The <em>Springfield Republican</em> on May 23
      reported that 1600 copies of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> had been
      sold "during the winter and spring" (see Whitman's letter to O'Connor of ). When Osgood discontinued publication
      in April, the royalty due to Whitman amounted to $405.50 (see Whitman's letter
      to Osgood &amp; Company of ). Unless
      there was a previous payment to the poet, Osgood sold 1622 copies of the book
      ($405.50 @ .25 per copy).<a href="#r8">[back]
