      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I do not know how to excuse myself to you for taking the liberty of writing to you—but
      I cannot help it. I must do it. A little while ago I read your Democratic Vistas,
      it was like a great help coming from a long way off. &amp; it came into my mind that I
      must
      
      
      speak to you. Do not be angry with me—I should be frightened at myself. only I believe
      in what you say in your book so much that I can hardly feel fear. I want you to tell
      me that you trust in what you say is unshaken, that it grows as you grow?
   </p>
   
   <p>it must be so different in your country from what it is here—it is hard sometimes
      to go on believing that the good will come—&amp; it seems to me that you forget
      
      that it must come for us here as well as for you. we need it so! &amp; if a good only
      comes to part of the world of people, it is not great enough—Do your people really
      in their souls care about such things? or is it only one or two? is it a dear belief
      to any of them that they hold steadfastly? we do some of us here believe in a true
      democratic spirit coming—but we hopes so in America &amp; wants to trust in her. therefore
      I am bold &amp; write to you for a word of hope. Your words that you have written are
      such a strength, it is
      
      so wonderful to find said, things that hover in one. I mean, to read things that one's
      heart cries out in answer to. this is what makes me so that I cannot help writing
      to you.
   </p>
