   </p>
   
   <p>Wont you read over carefully Amelia Rives'<sup><a href="#n4280" id="r1">1</a></sup> poem in today's
      Herald and give me an expert's opinion on it for publication in the Herald? I will
      call for this tomorrow, for I am sure you will have something instructive to say
      about the poem.<sup><a href="#loc.1093_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Very truly yours,
      <br></br>C.H. Browning

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>C. H. Browning worked in the
      Philadelphia office of the <em>New York Herald</em>, and he later
      worked in the same capacity for the <em>New York World</em>.
      Whitman described Browning as "a fine, dark-browed, vital, affectionate sort of
      a man—a newspaper man made of the real stuff" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.29.html">Sunday, August 12, 1888</a>). Browning convinced Whitman to write "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00052.html">A Voice from the Death</a>," a poem on the Johnstown flood that was
      printed in the <em>World</em> on June 7, 1889.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4280">1. Amélie Rives (1863–1945)
      was an American novelist, poet, and playwright, whose 1888 novel <em>The Quick or the Dead</em> sold 300,000 copies and created a
      scandal because of its erotic subject matter. Her personal life was also a
      sensation; she had an unhappy marriage to John Armstrong Chanler, the grandson
      of John Jacob Astor, and later to Prince Pierre Troubetzkoy of the well-known
      aristocratic Russian family. For more on Rives, see Francis Verzelius Newton
      Painter, <em>Poets of Virginia</em> (Richmond: B. F. Johnson
      Publishing Company, 1907).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.1093_n1">2. Whitman was angry at having
      been asked to provide commentary on work by a poet with whom he was not
      familiar. For his full reaction to the letter, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.33.html">Thursday, August 16, 1888</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]
