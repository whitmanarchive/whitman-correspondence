      <br></br><br></br>My very dear Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Finally I find time and quiet to write you—I beseech you be not angry at what may
      seem to you to be "apostate sentimentalism" &amp; neglect! To say that in the past two
      months I have had no time to acknowledge the receipt of your very welcome letter would
      be stupid; but, on the other hand, to affirm that during this time I had thought it
      better, influenced, perhaps, by my invariable tendency to procrastinate, to postpone
      writing till I could do so quietly, &amp; in a manner befitting my earnest affection for
      you &amp; the memory of the "good old times," would be emphatically the truth. Be appeased!
      Remember that since I left Genl. Smith I have been constantly on the "go"; either
      attending Genl. Wool<sup><a href="#tex.00123_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> (with whom I now am) on his tours of inspection, or bothering my brain with the detestable
      clerical duties incidental to my position. I take for granted that you are mollified,
      &amp; herewith proceed to talk unrestrainedly to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>The Spring has come, &amp; I long to have you write me again—on reading this sentence
      you will undoubtedly ask yourself why the "apostate sentimentalist" should wish to
      see you because the Spring had come: answer: I don't know. Charley Chauncey, of whose
      illness you have heard, is said to be much better—I leave my card often, but never
      see him, owing to the fact that only a chosen few are allowed that priviledge, but friend Raymond is dead.<sup><a href="#tex.00123_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> During a march from New Orleans he was suddenly attacked by congestive-fever, &amp; in
      less than 48 hours he had made his adieus to this world &amp; gone roaming into the suppositive
      one. Curious that the "Hater" should be first one to go. Our little joyful party of
      a year ago is entirely broken up. Now &amp; then I see Bloom &amp; Fritsch—the others I rarely
      see. You ask me to tell you about myself—alas! it would be but a stupid catalogue
      of folly to bore you with. How long I shall remain with Genl. Wool I do not know;
      if the government see fit to give either Genl. Smith or Genl. Franklin<sup><a href="#tex.00123_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> an active command I shall in all probability enter the field again. I have just come
      from my Mother, who, together with my Father, desires to be kindly remembered to you.
      My mother says she has heard of your whereabouts &amp; what you are doing from the news-papers<sup><a href="#tex.00123_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>—furthermore she states with unusual vehemence that she thought you a good &amp; noble
      man &amp; that the Deity would be sure even. I state what my Mother said mainly as an
      illustration of what a great many others have remarked to me concerning you &amp; your
      noble devotion to suffering man. As for myself I must say that I feel d—d proud of
      you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Don't forget to destroy this almost illegible &amp; dirty letter? It is a shame to send
      it to you, but I fear if I commence another I shall be interrupted &amp; not get through
      with it.
   </p>
   
   <p>I had a very different life from what I did last summer—no more beer-houses &amp; disreputable
      "cakes &amp; ale". Sometimes when I think of my poor little Clothilde &amp; you I feel as
      if I were not as happy now as then. However, "man must work &amp; woman must weep" I suppose!
   </p>
   
   <p>Everybody whom I meet who knew you formally asks after you with unaffected interest.
      Charley Russel<sup><a href="#tex.00123_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> was in town some weeks ago, he told me not to fail to send his warmest love to you.
      He is on Genl. Meade's<sup><a href="#tex.00123_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup> staff as Medical Inspector Genl. of the 5th Corps d'armeé— a first rate position
      &amp; one that he has earned by his industry &amp; talents.
   </p>
   
   <p>If I remain in town this summer I hope you will come on &amp; see me. I detest writing
      letters to a dear friend like you—its such a devilish slow &amp; insufficient way of communicating
      your thoughts.
   </p>
   
   <p>The country looks charmingly now—the other day I took a walk in the central park with
      Perk.<sup><a href="#tex.00123_n8" id="r7">7</a></sup>; the park was so heavenly that it actually made me as sentimental &amp; lachrymose as
      a school-boy—I'm damned if I wouldn't have given up all my hopes in the future to
      have had you &amp; my little girl with me then. Don't fail to write me, will you, old
      Boy! Be Charitable &amp; forgive! The Original Jacobo has just ordered me to see about
      some d—d fortification.
   </p>

      Gray was a captain in the Twentieth New York Infantry and later held the same
      rank in the Assistant Adjutant General's Volunteers. He became a major on
      January 4, 1865, and resigned on December 6 of the same year; see Francis B.
      Heitman, <em>Historical Register and Dictionary of the United
         States Army</em>, 2 vols. (Washington D.C.: Government Publications Office,
      1903). In 1862 he fought in the battle at Antietam, and at Charles Pfaff's beer
      cellar located in lower Manhattan, he gave Whitman "a fearful account of the
      battlefield at ½ past 9 the night following the engagement." (For discussion of
      Whitman's activity at Pfaff's, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/walt_whitman/index.html#bohemian">The Bohemian Years</a>.") See Whitman's notations in Frederick W. Hedge's
      <em>Prose Writers of Germany</em>, reprinted in Emory
      Holloway, ed., <em>Walt Whitman—Complete Poetry &amp; Selected
         Prose and Letters</em> (London: Nonesuch Press, 1938), 1099. In 1864,
      according to one of Whitman's notebooks (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt
      Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #103), Gray was stationed at New
      Orleans. He graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York in
      1871, and briefly practiced medicine with his father in New York. Whitman
      referred to him during this period in a notebook (The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #109). Later he practiced in Paris, Nice, and Geneva. He died of
      Bright's disease at St. Clair Springs, Michigan, on April 18, 1891; obituaries
      appeared in the <em>New York Herald</em> and the <em>New York Tribune</em> on August 19, 1891.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00123_n2">1. General John Ellis Wool
      (1784–1869) was the oldest Union general of the American Civil War and was
      in command of the Department of the East. Among other assignments, he led
      military operations in New York City during and after the draft riots the
      following July.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00123_n3">2. A Charles W. Chauncey was
      listed as an importer in the New York Directories of the period. Chauncey was
      part of the so-called Fred Gray Association, a group that gathered at Pfaff's
      beer saloon and that Ed Folsom and Kenneth M. Price characterize as "a loose
      confederation of young men who seemed anxious to explore new possibilities of
      male-male affection" (see chapter four, "Intimate Script and the New American
      Bible: 'Calamus' and the Making of the 1860 Leaves of Grass" from <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00152.html#chap4">
         <em>Re-Scripting Walt Whitman: An Introduction to His Life and
            Work</em>
         </a>). Along with Chauncey, members of the Fred Gray Association included Walt
      Whitman, Nat Bloom, Frederick Schiller Gray, Nat Gray, Charles Kingsley, Charles
      Russell, Hugo Fritsch, Fred Vaughan, a man known only as "Perkins" and someone
      referred to as "Raymond" that may be Henry J. Raymond.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00123_n4">3. It is not clear which
      general with the surname Smith is meant here. General William Buel Franklin
      (1823–1903) was a Union Army general in the American Civil War who saw
      action in the Peninsula Campaign, the Battle of Antietam, and the Battle of
      Fredericksburg.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00123_n5">4. Gray's mother may have seen
      Whitman's "The Great Army of the Sick" in the <em>New York
         Times</em> (February 26, 1863) or "Life Among Fifty Thousand Soldiers" in
      the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> (March 19, 1863).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00123_n6">5. Charles Russell, as
      mentioned in note 3, was part of the so-called Fred Gray Association.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00123_n7">6. George Gordon Meade
      (1815–1872) was a Union general during the Civil War who rose to the
      command of the Army of the Potomac. He is best known for his defeat of
      Confederate General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00123_n8">7. This may be a reference to
      the "Perkins" affiliated with the Fred Gray Association (see note 3
      above).<a href="#r7">[back]
