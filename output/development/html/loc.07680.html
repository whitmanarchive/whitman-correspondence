      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt: W.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Did you ever write a production called "Solitude"? It is credited to you
      by a pencil-script line in the Harvard College Library. I don't believe it is
      yrs, but that it is an imitation.<sup><a href="#loc.07680_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      It is unbound, about 2/3 the size of this sheet, contains 16 pp. &amp; has
      written on it in pencil "Presented [
      <span class="unclear">to?</span>]
       the
      Library by Prof. Jas: Russell Lowell<sup><a href="#loc.07680_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>, 1860. Sept 26." It is divided
      into two sections, with running titles "Chamber," &amp; "Street," &amp; begins
      "O! this ever lasting contact with men; This agony of a continual presence."
   </p>
   
   <p>I sh<u>d</u> like to get yr written word on it.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07680_n2">1. Whitman confirmed Kennedy's suspicions that "Solitude" was not one
      of the poet's works. See the letter from Whitman to Kennedy on <a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07680_n3">2. James Russell Lowell (1819–1891) was a poet,
      literary and social critic, abolitionist, editor, Harvard professor, and diplomat
      (Brendan A. Rapple,
