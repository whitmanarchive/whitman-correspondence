      <br></br>Down at the Staffords
      <br></br>Kirkwood (Glendale)<sup xmlns=""><a href="#pml.00050_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I still keep quite well considering—have been down here the past week<sup><a href="#pml.00050_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—every thing much the same as of old with our friends the S[tafford]s—Mr and Mrs S,
      and all their sons and daughters—Harry is down at Atlantic City, telegraph operator
      at a RR station but is going to Camden, same position—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A fine week down here for me—the finest sort of mellow sunny autumn weather—the old
      woods fine &amp; I in it for hours every day (sometimes I think it as good in its way
      as the Creek)—I go about nearly the same, my lameness no better (occasionally pretty
      bad, worse) but my feelings of comfort &amp; strength in general better than former years—often
      decidedly better—
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>13th Saturday</em>—Still here—We drove over yesterday (Mrs S and I) to the old place at Timber Creek
      &amp; down by the pond—I thought it beautiful as ever along the creek and banks—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This month <em>Scribner</em> has a long criticism by E C Stedman on L of G &amp; author, quite funny—"I would &amp; I
      would not" style, with a bad portrait<sup><a href="#pml.00050_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Dr. B[ucke] is furious—Burroughs thinks it well enough &amp; will do good—probably the
      truth between the two—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I see in the papers allusions to "the Gilchrist Thomas process" &amp; its adoption in
      some of the great works &amp; foundries—So I think it must be a permanent triumph—I congratulate
      you all &amp; of course Percy especially (for all I dont know him)<sup><a href="#pml.00050_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>Sunday 14th</em></p>
   
   
   <p>Rather cold, the feeling of snow, but dry &amp; pleasant in a way—I sell some of my books
      occasionally—have quite a supply left—of late have had more <em>American</em> purchasers than foreigners—(different from previous experience)<sup><a href="#pml.00050_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Rec'd your letter of two months since in Canada—it was very welcome—I wrote a postal
      card from here to Herbert, over a month ago<sup><a href="#pml.00050_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—Did he get it? Is the address on <em>this</em> right? Do you see any thing of my friend Josiah Child?<sup><a href="#pml.00050_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> A gentleman named Ingram<sup><a href="#pml.00050_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> (in the Engineer's office, London General Post Office) has written to me twice in
      the interest of publishing a Vol: of my prose writings in London<sup><a href="#pml.00050_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>—He seems to be a nice sort of man (is the author of an edition of Poe in London)—I
      think I shall give him your address &amp; ask to call on you.
   </p>

      Love to you all—where is Beatrice, &amp; how?

   <p>Nov 16—I return home to Camden to-day—Every thing as usual—I am well—fine November weather,
      crisp &amp; sunny—

   <p id="pml.00050_n1">1. The envelope for this letter

   <p id="pml.00050_n3">3. Stedman's "Walt Whitman"
      appeared in the November issue of <em>Scribner's Monthly</em>
      (47–64); it was reprinted in <em>Poets of America</em>
      (Edmund Clarence Stedman, ed., [Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1885], 349–395).
      For the reactions of Whitman's friends to Stedman's article, see Clara Barrus,
      <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston, New
      York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931), 192–195, and the letter from Walt Whitman
      to John Burroughs of .<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="pml.00050_n4">4. On July 17, 1880, Anne
      Gilchrist informed Louisa Whitman that some Americans had purchased Percy's
      "Dephosphorization process"; see Edwin Haviland Miller, "Amy H. Dowe and Walt
      Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 13 (September 1967),
      73–79. See also the letter from Walt Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist of .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00050_n5">5. Analysis of Whitman's
      records in the Commonplace Book about book sales in 1880 shows that purchasers
      were chiefly Americans (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="pml.00050_n7">7. On , Child informed Whitman that
      Trübner &amp; Co. had exhausted its supply of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>. He sent a draft for $80.50, and ordered ten copies of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and five of <em>Two
         Rivulets</em> (The John Rylands Library, Manchester, England).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00050_n8">8. Whitman wrote on
      September 19 to John H. Ingram (1848–1916), who, in addition to the

         Circle</em> and <em>Christopher Marlowe and His
         Associates</em> (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,

         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00050_n9">9. After reading this letter
      to his mother, Herbert Gilchrist wrote on November 30, 1880 about the
      publication of Whitman's prose writings in England. He wanted to illustrate the
      volume which he thought was to be entitled "Pond Musings by Walt Whitman"
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.; <em>The Letters of Anne
         Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Thomas B. Harned [Garden City, NY:
