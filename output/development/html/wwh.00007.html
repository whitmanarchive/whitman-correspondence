   <p>I suppose George must be about leaving you to-day,<sup><a href="#wwh.00007_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> to return to his regiment—and I can realize how gloomy you will all be for two or
      three days, especially Mother. Dear mother, you must keep up your spirits, and not
      get downhearted. I hope you are all well—I think about you all every day—is Mary home?<sup><a href="#wwh.00007_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—you must write me all about every thing—I suppose the bundle of George's shirts,
      drawers, &amp;c came safe by Adams express. I sent it last Saturday, and it ought to have
      been delivered Monday in Brooklyn. I did not pay the freight. Last Monday 16th I wrote
      to Mother, and sent her some shinplasters. Saturday previous I sent a note home, enclosing
      the express receipt.<sup><a href="#wwh.00007_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Jeff, I wrote a letter to the <em>Eagle</em>,<sup><a href="#wwh.00007_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> and sent it yesterday—if it appears, it will probably be to-day or to-morrow (or
      next day.) I wish you would look out for it, and buy me 20 of the papers, (the afternoon
      it appears,) and send them, the same as you did the other letter, direct care of Major
      Hapgood, the same—put the engravings (20 of the large head) in the same package—the
      postage will be at the rate of ½ cent per oz. You leave one end partially unsealed.
      Send them as <em>soon</em> as convenient, after the letter appears, but no such dreadful hurry.
   </p>
   
   <p>I suppose you have been in quite a state of pleasure and excitement home, with the
      visit of dear brother George. I was much pleased to hear by mother's letter that he
      was so sought for, and treated with so much attention—He deserves it all—you must
      tell me all the particulars of his visit.
   </p>
   
   <p>The Hospitals still engross a large part of my time and feelings—only I don't remain
      so long and make such exhausting-like visits, the last week—as I have had a bad humming
      feeling and deafness, stupor-like at times, in my head, which unfits me for continued
      exertion. It comes from a bad cold, gathering I think in my head. If it were not that
      some of the soldiers really depend on me to come, and the doctors tell me it is really
      necessary, I should suspend my visits for two or three days, at least. Poor boys,
      you have no idea how they cling to one, and how strong the tie that forms between
      us. Things here are just the same with me, neither better nor worse—(I feel so engrossed
      with my soldiers, I do not devote that attention to my office-hunting, which is needed
      for success.)
   </p>
   
   <p>Jeff, you must give my best respects to Mr. and Mrs. Lane, they have enabled me to
      do a world of good, and I can never forget them. I see you had a great Union meeting
      in the Academy of Music<sup><a href="#wwh.00007_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—it is impossible to tell what the government designs to do the coming season, but
      I suppose they will push on the war. The south is failing fast in many respects—D'Almeida,<sup><a href="#wwh.00007_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> the Frenchman I wrote about, told me that he was besieged every where down south
      to tell (for confederate money) any and every thing he had, his clothes, his boots,
      his haversack, &amp;c &amp;c. Then their niggers will gradually melt, <em>certain</em>. So the fates fight for us, even if our generals do not. Jeff, to see what I see
      so much of, puts one entirely out of conceit of war—still for all that I am not sure
      but I go in for fighting on—the choice is hard on either part, but to <em>cave</em> in the worst—good bye, dearest brother.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

      <em>The New York Herald</em> of March 17, 1863, described the
      meeting on the preceding day in glowing prose: "One of the largest and most
      truly enthusiastic meetings ever held in the new Brooklyn Academy of Music… The
      heart of every loyal man could not but throb with joy at seeing such a mass of
      beauty and intelligence coming forward with united voice to sustain the
      Government of the land."<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="wwh.00007_n6">6. Joseph-Charles d'Almeida
      (1822–1880), a professor and author of <em>Problèmes de
         physique</em> (1862), came to the United States in 1862. In the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection, there are three interesting letters from d'Almeida to
      William Douglas O'Connor, a close friend and associate of Whitman's. From
      Memphis, Tennessee, on January 28, 1863, d'Almeida explained that because of the
      kindness of a Miss Rebecca Harding he had been introduced to <em>la société rebelle</em>. On March 2, he asked O'Connor to visit him in the
      Old Capitol Prison in Washington D.C. The <em>Washington National
         Republican</em> of this date listed d'Almeida among refugees who were
      committed to Old Capitol Prison for examination. From New York, on March 27(?),
      d'Almeida wrote his farewell letter after he had been to Boston, where he had
      been entertained by James Fields, and had met Longfellow, Emerson, and Agassiz:
      "I carry with me a little American library in which the Leaves of Grass are
      included."<a href="#r6">[back]
