      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Tis a long time since I have had the pleasure of hearing from you so I fear you did
      not receive the letter I sent on receipt of your photographs quite a good while ago
      so I will write a short letter again hoping better luck this time. I am getting around
      quite lively on just a single cane and my health is good. I am quite strong but not
      very fleshy as you will observe by the enclosed pho[tograph], which you may think
      was a long time coming I am getting ready to day for a short journey out to Livingston
      Co. to visit some relatives and friends so you must be so kind as to excuse this short
      note.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have not heard from Fraser in a number of weeks but hope you have seen him much
      oftener. The last time he wrote he was a little better but thought he would be able
      to leave hospital at the expiration of 1865, but I most earnestly hope he will not
      be obliged to remain so long.
   </p>
   
   <p>Tis very pleasant to day but pretty cold. I write this not knowing but you may have
      left the place you were but shall use the envelope which you sent me. I would like
      much to see you again and have a good visit once more and I pray that we meet sometime.
   </p>
   
   <p>I received a letter from Wood<sup><a href="#loc.000610_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> a few days since, he is visiting Tommy<sup><a href="#loc.000610_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> (No. 6) he was quite well and enjoying himself well, said Tommy had a pleasant home
      and they were having a good time generally. Now good bye, my good friend and may heaven
      keep you safe from harm. Anson Ryder, Jun.
