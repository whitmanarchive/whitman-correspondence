      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I must write you a line or two but it will be a short letter—I am on my way back to
      Camden, stopping here only temporarily. Have had a very successful summer trip—have
      jaunted over 3000 miles, no mishaps, and generally everything working in well—have
      met with many friends, &amp; kindness &amp; good will everywhere—I am as well as usual again
      the last two months, indeed I think I am better than usual—the climate, country &amp;c
      agree with me &amp; I almost hate to leave them. Dr and Mrs Bucke have been like brother
      &amp; sister, unvaryingly kind &amp; helpful &amp; affectionate—Dr has several times spoken of
      you—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter of a month since<sup><a href="#upa.00184_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—My brother &amp; sister are well, &amp; matters as usual with them—Dr B wishes to be remembered—he
      has come on to the Falls with me. Peter Doyle has also come on from Washington, to
      spend a short time here &amp; then return with me to Philadelphia. Love to you, dear friend,
      &amp; to Beatrice, Herbert &amp; Grace—
   </p>
