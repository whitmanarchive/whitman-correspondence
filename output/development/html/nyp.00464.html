   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00464_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd Aug 19/82." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service Bureau
      | Washington D C. It is postmarked: Camden | Aug | 6 | 6 PM | N.J.; Washington,
      D.C. | Aug | 7 | 4 AM | 1882 | Recd.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00464_n2">2. Whitman never stated the
      exact number of copies of the second Philadelphia impression. Since he referred
      to the "cautious 1000" copies of the first impression, presumably this printing
      was larger. Whitman wrote in a letter to John Burroughs on  that the second impression was "now
      nearly gone." On  he wrote to O'Connor
      that Rees Welsh &amp; Co. were "paying out their 3d edition." On  he wrote to O'Connor that "they are
      now on <em>their fourth</em> Phila: ed'n L of G." The fifth
      impression was run off in October (see the letter from Whitman to Sylvester
      Baxter of ).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00464_n4">4. In his answer on , O'Connor mentioned with resentment that
      J. B. Gilder, of <em>The Critic</em>, was supporting Chadwick and
      deplored the fact that <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, according to the
      New York <em>Tribune</em> on August 15, was now "proscribed by
      Trinity College, Dublin" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:496).<a href="#r4">[back]
