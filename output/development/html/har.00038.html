      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>My father and other members of the "Society of Old Brooklynites" are anxious to
      receive a line, or to ask from you, to read at their annual dinner on the 9th
      [
      <span class="unclear">brox?</span>]
      , and have
      requested me to write to you, and beg the favor. I am afraid from what I have
      noticed in the papers, that you have not been in good health of late, but I trust
      that you are now strong again, and able to give the old friends of your youth a line
      from your gifted pen, on this, as well as many future annual reunions.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With sincere regards
      <br></br>Very Respectfully Yours
      <br></br>John W. Wiggins Jr.
