   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Donald Nicholson (1834–1915)
      served as the managing editor of the <em>New York Tribune</em>.
      Born in England, Nicholson graduated with honors from Christ College, Cambridge
      before moving to New York in 1868. In New York, Nicholson and Albert D.
      Richardson wrote a popular biography of Civil War General Ulysses S. Grant.
      Through Richardson, an editorial staff member at the <em>Tribune</em>, Nicholson met then managing editor Whitelaw Reid, who worked
      under editor Horace Greeley. Nicholson began work at the <em>Tribune</em> as Reid's secretary, eventually becoming managing editor under
      Reid when Reid succeeded Greeley as editor in 1872. Nicholson came into contact
      with Whitman during Whitman's attempts to publish in the <em>Tribune</em>.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0500">1. Whitelaw Reid (1837–1912) was the editor of
      the <em>New York Tribune</em> from 1872 to 1905 and later American
      ambassador to France (1889–1892) and England (1905–1912). He met
      Whitman in the hospitals during the Civil War. Of his relations with the poet,
      Reid later observed: "No one could fail then [during the War] to admire his zeal
      and devotion, and I am afraid that at first my regard was for his character
      rather than his poetry. It was not till long after 'The Leaves of Grass' period
      that his great verses on the death of Lincoln conquered me completely." See
      Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and Friend</em>
      (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 213, and <em>Studies in
         Bibliography</em>, ed. Fredson Bowers (Charlottesville, VA: Bibliographical
      Society of the University of Virginia, 1956), 8:242–249.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.07445_n1">2. No note from Whitman to
      Whitelaw Reid or the <em>Tribune</em> dated May 28 has been found.
      "Broadway Revisited," which appeared in the <em>Tribune</em> on
      May 10, was the first of three "chatty" letters Whitman submitted that May (<em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 3:153 n39). The others were "Real
      Summer Openings," published May 17, and "These May Afternoons," published May
      24. See the letters from Whitman to Whitelaw Reid of , and .<a href="#r2">[back]
