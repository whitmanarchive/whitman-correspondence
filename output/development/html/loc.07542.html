   <p>Our fine weather—upon the whole the finest December we ever had here—has
      changed, &amp; to-day is dark &amp; sulky &amp; dripping—My fair feelings
      continue—the bowel action reasonable—&amp;c. &amp;c.—I enclose a
      sort of dedication for one of the Vol's. for you to keep for yourself—It ought
      to be inserted, cut &amp; fitted properly by an expert—a book binder if you
      can have the deftness of such an one—When the books went I was unable to get
      up out of bed, &amp; was in a horrible plight, with only the wish to get the Vols.
      sent to you while I c'd direct it—or I sh'd have written in then—I sent
      round to the printer's to get the corrections made—some more impressions
      struck off—but will do so if you have the least wish—I will soon send
      you a few copies as they are, with the accented e in Goethe scratch'd out, (wh' is
      very easily done.)<sup><a href="#loc.07542_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Y'r two letters came this morning—I am sitting here in the big chair—have
      eaten some ice cream — drank a cup of milk for my 2 o'c luncheon— Ed
      Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r2">2</a></sup> is snoozing on the couch near—&amp; so
      to-morrow begins with 1889 with us all—<sup><a href="#loc.07542_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>

      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07542_n1">1. Whitman was referring to
      "An impromptu criticism." Bucke had written to Whitman on December 20, 1888,
      registering at length his enthusiasm for Whitman's just-published <em>Complete Poems and Prose</em>. Whitman decided to have Bucke's
      letter printed for distribution among his friends and disciples, and he titled
      it "An impromptu criticism on the 900 page Volume, 'The Complete Poems and Prose
      of Walt Whitman,' first issued December, 1888." The first printing had several
      typos, including the addition of an acute accent over the first "e" of "Goethe,"
      so Whitman had the errors corrected in a second printing that was completed by
      January 2, 1889. See Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.57.html">Thursday, December 27, 1888</a>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">2. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07542_n2">3. According to Miller's
      tabulation, based upon his letters and his entries in the <em>Commonplace Book</em>, Whitman's income in 1888 amounted to at least
      $925.04: royalties, $177.01; sales of books, $107.66; payments for
      articles and poems, $277.00; gifts, $224.37; and miscellaneous,
      $139.00. (The figures on book sales are to some extent conjectural, since
      Miller had to assume Whitman charged uniform prices for his various books.) It
      is probably of relevance to note that, beginning in 1888, Whitman's friends
      contributed regularly to a nursing fund; hence he did not receive quite so many
      gifts as in previous years. It is also of significance that as his health
      deteriorated, recordings in <em>Commonplace Book</em> were less
      complete than hitherto. Thus there are very real discrepancies between amounts
      he deposited periodically in the bank and receipts of money from various
      sources.<a href="#r3">[back]
