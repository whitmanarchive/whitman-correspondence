      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>If things go on as they have for the past week, you will have to think yourself lucky
      if you get even a postal in ten days. You must remember that I am housekeeper,
      nurse, marketer, &amp; have to see that the house is decent, if
      
      possible, besides being interrupted at every 
      ten minutes to answer some one who calls from a good motive to ask how W<u>m</u><sup><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup>. 
      is, but would do better not to come often.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So far I am the <u>only</u> nurse, &amp; if you have been as
      badly
      
      off as he is, you may have some idea of what it means, in this case it means that
      I
      wash &amp; dress him so far as he can be dressed,—wash his urinals, for he has
      to be protected night &amp; day, from the constant dripping,— &amp; to keep
      
      him at all clean is nearly impossible. Some nights I get not more than four hours
      sleep &amp; that very broken, &amp; some days not one moment to rest at all. To-day
      I am nearly blind from loss of sleep. We have some very bad nights since the
      
      attack four weeks ago, &amp; one of the very bad and troublesome developments is the nausea
      
      and throwing up, so you see that I am not very idle, &amp; I some days could not write
      a postal 
      card to save you.  You will ask <u>why</u> we don't have a nurse? the
      
      answer is William does not want one, &amp; is not ready yet, [illegible] sends love to you &amp; says tell you he would write if he could.
   </p>

      Good by. 
      <br></br>As ever — 
      <br></br>Nelly O'Connor. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have had to leave this letter <u>six</u> times to do some thing else.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
