   <p>Though it is but a few days since I posted a letter my dearest friend, I must write
      you again—because I cannot help it, my heart is so full—so full of love
      &amp; sorrow and struggle. The day before yesterday I saw Mr. Conway's printed account of you, &amp; instead of the cheerful report I had been told of, he speaks of your
      having given up hope of recovery. Those words were like a sharp knife plunged into
      me They choked me with bitter tears. <u>
         Dont
         
          give up that hope,</u> for the sake of those that so tenderly
      passionately love you—would give their lives with  joy for you. Why who knows better than
      you, how much hope &amp; the will have to do with it &amp; I know quite well that
      the belief does not depress you—that you are ready to accept either lot with
      calmness, cheerfulness, perfect faith, perhaps with equal joy. But for all that, it
      does you harm. Ideas always have a tendency to accomplish themselves. And what right
      have the doctors to utter gloomy prophecies? The wisest of them know the best how
      profoundly in the dark they are as to much that goes on within  us, especially in maladies like yours.
      (O cling to life with a resolute hold my beloved to bless us with your presence
      unspeakably dear beneficent presence—me to taste of it before so very long
      now—thirsting pining loving me. Take through these poor words of <u>mine</u> some breath of
      
      tender tender ineffable love that fills my heart and soul and body take of it to
      strengthen the very springs of your life: it is capable of that. [
      <span class="unclear">O</span>]
       its cherishing
      warmth and joy, if it could only get to you, only fold you round close enough  would help I know.
      Soon soon as ever my boy has one to love &amp; care
      for him all his own, I will come, I may not before, not if it should break my heart
      to stop away from you, for his welfare is my sacred charge [
      <span class="unclear">&amp;</span>]
       nearer &amp;
      dearer than all to me verily my God strengthen me, comfort me, stay for me—let
      that have a little beginning on this dear earth which is for all eternity which will
      live &amp; grow immortally into a diviner reality than the heart of man has
      conceived.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am well satisfied with Norah dear Friend. She is very affectionate, loveable,
      prudent &amp; clear in all practical matters, well suited to Percy in tastes, [illegible]

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
