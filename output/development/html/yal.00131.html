      <br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You will not remember the writer of this letter. he is only one of the many whom
      you befriended during our struggle for the right. one of Uncle Sam's boys. whose
      cause you made yours in poetry. charity and words of cheer. for the hale and
      hearty as well as the wounded and jaded soldier. I won't forget Walt Whitman. I
      have just read that you have completed your half century. may you live to a
      ripe old age. loving and beloved. I was reading "Drum Taps" last night. no man
      can depict Army life so vividly that had not spent his time
      amongst the boys. Again wishing you health and strength. a happy existence.
   </p>

      signs his name "Thomson." He wrote to Walt Whitman on : "You will not remember the writer of this letter. ...
      I wont forget Walt Whitman. I have just read that you have completed your half
      century. May you live to a ripe old age, loving and beloved. I was reading 'Drum
      Taps' last night, no man can depict Army life so vividly that had not spent his
