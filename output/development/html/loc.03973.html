      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I sit here in the office with nothing to do, I thought that I would write a few
      lines to you:<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r1">1</a></sup> I don't know as I have anything to say that will be news to you, but thought I would
      write more for practice than anything else. Ben has gon away today but Geo. Fox is here with me, Ben will not be home for a coupel of days or more, he has gon to N.Y. I don't feel very well this afternoon, have got the head-ache as usual, worse this
      A.M.
      
      
      
      than I have had it for sometime. The folks and I have commenced to miss you aready, they were talking of you as soon as you left. I wish you was down here with us;
      when you came down Debbie<sup><a href="#n0844" id="r2">2</a></sup> said to me, it seems like home now Mr. Whitman is back: I wish you would put the
      ring on my finger again, it seems to me there is something that is wanting to compleete our friendship when I am [
      <span class="unclear">missing you.?</span>]
       I have tride to studdy it out but cannot find out what it is. You know when you put it on there was but
      one thing to part it from
      
      
      
      me and that was death. Isn't it a fine day out, it does not look like a Fall day,
      more like a day in April, although there is no birds singing, but still I think that
      the day has more the ppearance of a Spring day than a Fall one. I think I will bring
      my letter to a close for I have to make out some bills for the Freight-master. Good
      by.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0590">1. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0844">2. Deborah Stafford was the sister of
      Harry Stafford. She married Joseph Browning. See <em>Daybooks and
         Notebooks</em>, ed. William White (New York: New York University Press,
      1978), 1:35.<a href="#r2">[back]
