   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00803_n1">1. The date and summary of the
      letter are drawn from an auction catalog put out by the American Art Association
      for a sale on March 10–11, 1924. The location of this manuscript is
      presently unknown. The letter was probably written in 1878 after the Gilchrists'
      departure from Philadelphia in April. After their arrival in New York, at first
      they took rooms in Brooklyn (see the letter from Whitman to John Burroughs of
      ), but, on December 29, when
      Anne Gilchrist wrote to her daughter Beatrice, who was in Boston, she had just
      moved to 112 Madison Avenue, New York City (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.). This note may have been addressed to Jeannette Gilder, as Whitman wrote a
      post card to her on this date (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Feinberg
      Collection).<a href="#r1">[back]
