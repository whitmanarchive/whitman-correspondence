   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00569_n1">1. This letter dates to
      August 13–16, 1863. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman received George
      Washington Whitman's  letter from
      Milldale, Mississippi, and she forwarded it to Walt Whitman with this brief
      note. Edwin Haviland Miller dated Louisa's letter "after" July 23?, 1863
      (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 1:373), but this brief note from Louisa
      must date to mid-August 1863. In his  letter to Louisa, Walt acknowledged "George's letter." Miller
      associated that letter loosely with George's  letter from Kentucky—at least insofar as it
      indicates George's location—but the forwarded letter from George that
      Walt received in mid-August is almost certainly this one. Walt's August 18
      letter cannot acknowledge George's August 16, 1863 letter because Louisa
      postponed forwarding that letter for several days while she awaited an
      express packet (see her 
      letter to Walt).<br><br>
      George's July 23 letter had been long delayed by his extended expedition from
      Kentucky to Mississippi with Ambrose Burnside's Ninth Corps (see Jerome M.
      Loving, ed., <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington
         Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975], 97).
      According to Thomas Jefferson Whitman's  letter to Walt, "we do not hear from George." Walt had not
      received word from George a week later: "I feel so anxious to hear from
      George, one cannot help feeling uneasy" (see his  letter to Louisa). George's August 16, 1863
      letter confirms that his July 23, 1863 letter to his mother was the most
      recent he had sent.<br><br>
      Since Walt acknowledged George's forwarded letter and another letter (not
      extant) that Louisa promised to send the following day (see Walt's August
      18, 1863 letter to Louisa), this letter dates to August 13–16,
      1863.

   <p id="duk.00569_n2">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      August 14–17, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman is not extant. She shared news
      of Andrew Jackson Whitman's continuing struggle with a throat condition (he had
      lost his voice) and an abusive letter from son-in-law Charles L. Heyde. She
      presumably also inquired whether Walt had written his sister Hannah Heyde,
      Charles's wife, about George Washington Whitman's letter and informed Walt that
      she had shared his Washington address with Emma Price, the daughter of Abby
      Price (see Walt's  letter to
      Louisa).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00569_n5">3. See George Washington
      Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman, from Milldale, Mississippi. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00438_n4">4. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n3">5. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
