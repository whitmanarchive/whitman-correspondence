      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr Whitman, 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I [illegible] to address you thus informally because I love your work</p>
   
   <p>I want to ask if you can help me to find four little lines of yours that I saw last
      summer—perhaps in one of the monthlies.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have hunted diligently for them but met no success.—I think they were called
       "Twilight":
      at all events they were of the Twilght, and several to trace a likeness between the
      fading day and your own declining years—They were very sweet, very tender, and
      the whole was a beautiful chord whose harmony still vibrates in me, but the notes
      of
      which I have lost.<sup><a href="#loc.03706_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>If I am asking too much, then pay no attention to me, for you must have many calls
      and demands upon your time.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am a young man—a Californian—my home being in Los Angeles—</p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer"> 
      and 
      always your steadfast admirer 
      <br></br>Chas F. Sloane
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Is there any list of your books—all of them—their prices, and where
      they may be found. Do you have time yourself at all, as I have heard?
   </p>
