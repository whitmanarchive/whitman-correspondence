   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,

      an American painter. His relationship with Whitman was characterized by deep
      mutual respect, and he soon became a close friend of the poet. For more on

   <p id="n0611">6. John Swinton (1829–1901), a journalist and
      friend of Karl Marx, became acquainted with Whitman during the Civil War.
      Swinton, managing editor of the <em>New York Times</em>,
      frequented Pfaff's, where he probably met Whitman. Whitman's correspondence with
      Swinton began on . Swinton's
      enthusiasm for Whitman was unbounded. On , Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly impressed with the great
      humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you. I read this afternoon in
      the book. I read its first division which I never before read. I could convey no
      idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more to me than all other books and
      poetry." On , Swinton wrote what
      the poet termed "almost like a love letter": "It was perhaps the very day of the
      publication of the first edition of the 'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of
      it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street, Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it
      with wonder, and felt that here was something that touched on depths of my
      humanity. Since then you have grown before me, grown around me, and grown into
      me" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.13.html">Tuesday, April 10, 1888</a>). He praised Whitman in the <em>New York Herald</em> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke,
      <em>Walt Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
      36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
      for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <em>New York Sun</em>, and for the next four years edited the
      weekly labor journal, <em>John Swinton's Paper</em>. When this
      publication folded, he returned to the <em>Sun</em>. See Robert
      Waters, <em>Career and Conversations of John Swinton</em>

      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
