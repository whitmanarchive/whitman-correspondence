   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.03834_n1">1. This postal card is
      addressed: R Pearsall Smith | 4653 Germantown Avenue | Philadelphia. It is
      postmarked: Camden | Mar | 11 | 7 AM | 1884 | N.J.; Philad Pa | Mar | 11 | 8 AM
      | Recd; and, on verso of postal card: Rec'd Phila | Mar 11 84 | 11 AM.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.03834_n3">2. Smith called on the poet
      on March 8—"earnest &amp; friendly, deeply so" (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). In May, Dr. Richard
      Maurice Bucke stayed with Smith, and during his visit there was discussion of a
      "project for the special ed'n L of G. backed by Mr. S. and Dr. Mr S's sudden
      &amp; peremptory withdrawal from the project (Mrs. S 'wouldn't allow the book to
      be brought in the house')" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Evidently Mrs. Smith's
      censure did not extend to the poet himself, since she and her daughters on his
      birthday sent sheets and a bolster (see the letter from Whitman to Mary Whitall
      Smith of ).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03834_n2">3. On March 8, Whitman spent
      "all the day &amp; evening" with Tasker Lay, who, when the poet met him in 1881,
      was "15 or 16." The young man died on the following day and was buried on March
      12 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). About this time Whitman gave the boy's
      grandfather, Alfred, a laborer, various sums of money, including $16 for the
      rent due on the house at 328 Mickle Street (see Whitman's Commonplace Book and
      his letter to John Burroughs of ).
      The Lays rented the house at the time (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The
         Solitary Singer</em> [1955], 516). According to entries in his Commonplace
      Book, Whitman paid Mrs. Lay $2 weekly from April 5 to September 27.<a href="#r3">[back]
