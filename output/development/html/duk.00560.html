   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00560_n11">1. This letter dates to March
      31, 1869. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "31 march," and Richard
      Maurice assigned the year 1869. Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver cited
      Bucke's date (<em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of
         Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University
      Press, 1949], 200–201), and Edwin Haviland Miller cited Gohdes and
      Silver's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:367). The year is consistent,
      as Bucke indicated, with the publication of Walt Whitman's "Whispers of Heavenly
      Death." Bucke's scholarly abbreviation "N.B." for <em>nota
         bene</em> (see page image 1) may be to signal that Walt Whitman forwarded
      copies of the poem to his mother Louisa Van Velsor Whitman almost immediately
      upon receipt of the thirty copies that he had requested from the publisher (see
      Walt's  draft letter to the New York
      office of Edmund Routledge). Routledge is the London-based publisher that had
      issued the set of poems during the previous October. This letter corresponds
      with Walt's request and with Louisa's receipt of printed copies of "Whispers of
      Heavenly Death" from publisher Routledge.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">2. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n6">3. Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975), 10–11.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00560_n12">4. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., resided in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles L.
      Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. This letter is but one of many in
      which Louisa Van Velsor Whitman remarks on Charles Heyde's offensive letters and
      his willingness to deny Hannah access to letters from her family. Late in 1868
      Hannah suffered a thumb infection that led Doctor Samuel W. Thayer to lance her
      wrist in November and to amputate her thumb the following month (see Charles L.
      Heyde to Louisa Whitman, December 1868, Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver,
      ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt
         Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1949], 225).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00560_n8">5. This letter has the most
      extended description of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's upstairs neighbor "chappells
      wife," whose first name have been Janey or Jenne. This letter gives her name as
      "janey," but she is probably the same person that Louisa named "jenne chappell"
      in her  letter, where she is
      described as the wife of "the doctor." This upstairs neighbor may also be the
      same person who visited Louisa at the same time as Charlie Mann, a young child
      and downstairs neighbor who died from the croup in late 1868 (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00560_n1">6. See <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00051.html">"Whispers of Heavenly Death"</a> (<em>The Broadway, A
         London Magazine</em> 10 [October 1868], 21–22). The set of five poems
      was republished in <em>Passage to India</em> (1871).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">7. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00560_n14">8. The "a" is an abbreviated
      form of avenue. George Washington Whitman purchased the lot on Putnam Avenue as
      one of his earliest investment properties after his return from the Civil War,
      but he decided against building a house on the lot shortly after the purchase
      (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's 
      letter to Walt Whitman). Putnam Avenue runs east-west from Broadway to Grand
      Street, through the present-day Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00560_n13">9. Clermont Avenue runs
      north-south between Atlantic Avenue and Flatbush Avenue, which then bordered the
      U.S. Navy Yard.
