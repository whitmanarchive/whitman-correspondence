      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>All the papers have reached me—3 separate packets (with the handwriting on them that
      makes my heart give a glad bound). I look through them full of interest &amp; curiosity,
      wanting to realize as I do, in things small as well as things large my Land of Promise—the
      land where I hope to plant down my children—so strong in the faith that they, &amp; perhaps
      still more those that come after them will bless me for that (consciously or unconsciously,
      it doesn't matter which) that I should set out with a cheerful heart on that errand
      if I knew the first breath I drew on American soil, would be my last in life. 
      
      
      I searched hopeful for a few words telling of improvement in your health, in the last
      paper. But perhaps it does not follow from there being no such mention that there
      is no progress. May you be steadily though ever so slowly gaining ground, my Darling!
      Now that I understand the nature of the malady (a deficient flow of blood to the brain
      if it has been rightly explained to me) I realize that recovery must be very gradual: as the coming on of it must have been
      slow &amp; insidious. And perhaps that, &amp; also even from before the war time with its
      tremendous strain emotional &amp; physical &amp; is part of the price paid for the greatness
      of the Poems &amp; for their immortal destiny—the rapt exaltation the intensity of joy
      &amp; sorrow &amp; struggle—all that went to give them their life giving power. 
      
      
      
      For I have felt many times in reading them as if the light &amp; heat of their sacred
      fire must needs have consumed the vital energies of him in whose breast it was generated,
      faster then even the most splendid physique could renew itself. For our sakes, for
      humanity's sake you suffer now, I do not doubt, every bit as much as the soldier's
      wounds are for his country's sake. The more precious the more tenderly cherished,
      the more drawing the hearts that understand, with ineffable yearnings for this.
   </p> 
   
   
   <p> My children all continue well in the main, I am thankful to say though Beatrice (the eldest girl, looks paler than I could wish &amp; is working her brains too much
      &amp; the rest of her too little just at present with the hope of getting through the
      Apothecaries Hall exam:, in Arts next Sep. which involves a good bit of Latin and
      mathematics. This is all women can do in England toward getting into 
      
      the medical profession &amp; as the Apoth; Hall certificate is accepted for the preliminary
      studies at Paris &amp; Zurich, I make no doubt it is also at Philadelphia &amp; New York so
      that she would  be able to enter on medical studies then virtual preliminary work when we come. For she continues steadfastly desirous to win her
      way into that field of usefulness &amp; I believe is well fitted to work there, with her
      grave earnest thoughtful feeling nature &amp; strong bodily frame. She is able to enjoy
      your Poems &amp; the vistas: broods over them a great deal. Percy is bending his energies now to mastering the processes that go to the production
      of the very best quality of Copper such as is used for telegraph wires &amp;c. No easy
      matter, copper being the most difficult, in a metallurgical point of view of all the
      metals to deal with &amp; the Company in whose 
      
      employ he is having hitherto been unsuccessful in this branch. His looks, too, do
      not quite satisfy me:—it is partly rather too long hours of work—but still more not
      getting a good meal till the end of it. It is so hard to make the young believe that
      the stomach shares the fatigue of the rest of the body &amp; that there is not nervous
      energy enough left for it to do all its principal work to perfection after a long
      exhausting day. But I hope now I or rather his own experience &amp; I together have convinced
      him in time, &amp; he promises me faithfully to arrange for a good meal in the middle
      of the day however much grudging the time. My little artist Herby is still chiefly
      working from the antique, but tries his hand at home occasionally with oils &amp; to life
      &amp; has made an oil sketch of me which though imperfect in drawing &amp;c gives far more
      the real character &amp; expression 
      
      of my face than the photographs. Have you heard, I wonder, of William Rossetti's approaching marriage. It is to take place early in the New Year. The lady is Lucy
      Brown daughter of one of our most eminent artists (he was the friend who first put
      into my hand the "Selections" from your Poems). Lucy is a very sweet-tempered cultivated lovable woman well fitted I should say to make
      William Rossetti happy. They are to continue in the old home Euston Sq. with Mrs.
      Rossetti &amp; the Sisters, who are one &amp; all fond of Lucy. I am glad he is going to be
      married for I think he is a man capable both of giving and receiving a large measure
      of domestic happiness. I hope the dear little girls at St. Louis 
      
      are well.—And you my Darling O surely the sun is piercing through the dark clouds
      once more, and strength &amp; health and gladness returning. O fill yourself with happy
      thoughts for you have filled others with joy &amp; strength &amp; will do so for countless
      generations, &amp; from these hearts flows back &amp; will ever flow a steady current of love
      &amp; the beautiful fruits of love. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When you next send me a paper, if you feel that you are getting on ever so little
      dearest friend put a dash under the word <u>London</u>—I have looked back at all your old addresses &amp; I see you never do put any lines,
      so I shall know it was not done absently but really means you are better. And how
      that line will 
      
      gladden my eyes darling! Love from us all.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
