      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Some years ago when 
      Ihad
      
       occasion to address you, you were so good as to say you should be happy to
      hear from me again; and as my admiration of your works and interest in whatever
      concerns you have rather strengthened than weakened, 
      Ifeel
      
       sure you will not mind my asking one or two questions.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As a faithful student of your books, 
      Ihave
      
       made it my business to obtain every edition I could, and all portraits and
      notable accounts
      and criticisms. But there is one edition in particular which I have never been able
      to see ever,—that mentioned by Rossetti as having been
      issued in 1856 in 16 ms .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The American agent to whom my last application for this was
      forwarded says: "I don't think there is an 1856 edition. There is one earlier or
      later in great demand, and at a high price, something like 25 $ to 30 $; but
      I can't find that. There was a copy auctioned the other night at something like the
      above".
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Can you tell me whether there is or not an edition between the one set up by yourself in 1855 and
      that of Thayer &amp; Eldridge dated 1860-61? If there is, can you give me any
      particulars that will help me towards buying it? Also, what is the edition that
      fetches 25 $ to 30 $? Not that of 1855; for I hear that can be had for 3 or
      4.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When at my friend Mr W.B. Scott's a few weeks ago, I saw a proof
      of a fine portrait of you engraved by Linton: may I ask what it
      is from, and where it is published?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I live in hopes of publishing some day a good hybrid edition of your works; and my
      enquiries about editions are not mere bibliomania. I find they vary considerably; and my
      experience is that the careful collations of various versions of a poet's work is
      often a key as well as an incitement to the right understanding of his spirit and
      intent.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am at present engaged on an edition of Shelly which will be
      the handsomest in form, and the most extensive in matter (I hope), yet published;
      and that takes up most of my time.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Henry Buxton Forman (1842–1917) was most
      notably the biographer and editor of Percy Shelley and John Keats. On , Buxton sent a copy of R. H.
      Horne's <em>The Great Peace-Maker; A Sub-marine Dialogue</em>
      (London, 1872) to Whitman. This poetic account of the laying of the Atlantic
      cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death, Forman's reputation
      declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham Pollard and John Carter
      published <em>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth
         Century Pamphlets</em>, which exposed Forman as a forger of many first
      "private" editions of poetry.
