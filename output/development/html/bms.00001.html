   <p>First I ought to apologize for not answering your letters before—I am always
      glad to get them—Nothing specially new or different with me—I am willing
      you should print "Specimen Days" in your series—let W[alter] S[cott] send me
      what he thinks he can afford, &amp; I shall want 10 copies of the book.<sup><a href="#bms.00001_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I should advise you to leave out the Appendix—If
      you want it further cut down, let me furnish you with a prepared copy—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="bms.00001_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Ernest Rhys | 59 Cheyne Walk | Chelsea | London England. It is postmarked:
      Camden | Oct | 13 | 8 PM | 1886(?) | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="bms.00001_n2">2. On  Rhys spoke frankly: "Thanks very much
      for letting me have it! I will get as much as I can out of the publishers; for
      as Walter Scott is one of the largest railway contractors, as well as a
      publisher, &amp; well stocked with money, I have no scruple on that score. It is
      not easy in any case to get much out of him, unfortunately. For my own sake, as
      well as yours, I wish it were!" On , he informed Whitman that Scott was willing to pay ten guineas
      for <em>Specimen Days</em>, the same amount he had paid for the
      right to print <em>The Poems of Walt Whitman [Selected]</em>
      (Walter Scott: London, 1886). (Also see the letter from Whitman to Ernest Rhys
      of .)<a href="#r2">[back]
