   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Deborah Stafford was the sister of
      Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. She
      married Joseph Browning. See <em>Daybooks and Notebooks</em>, ed.
      William White (New York: New York University Press, 1978), 1:35. Debbie and
      Harry's parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse
      Farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07365_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Mrs: Debbie Browning | Care of Will Goldy | p o box 91 | Topeka Kansas. It is
      postmarked: Camden, N.J. | April 19 | 8 P M | 87.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00082_n7">2. Glendale, New Jersey, was
      where the Staffords had moved after leaving their farm at Timber Creek, where
      Whitman had often visited.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0589d">3. Edwin Stafford (1856–1906) was one of
      Debbie's siblings.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0590a">4. Harry Stafford (b. 1858) was one of Debbie's
      siblings. Walt Whitman met Harry in 1876, beginning a relationship which was
      almost entirely overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because
      Stafford's name appears nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>—though it does appear
      frequently in the last three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s.
      Whitman occasionally referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but
      the relationship between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For
      further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07365_n3">5. Walt Whitman presented
      his Lincoln lecture in New York on April 15, 1887, before a distinguished
      audience including Samuel Clemens, James Russell Lowell, John Hay, Augustus
      Saint-Gaudens, and Andrew Carnegie, who contributed $350.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1060a">6. Ruth Stafford Goldy (1866–1939) was one of
      Debbie's siblings. When Whitman wrote this letter, Debbie was visiting Ruth in
      Kansas.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4125">7. "Jo" probably refers to Joseph
      Browning, Deborah's husband.<a href="#r7">[back]
