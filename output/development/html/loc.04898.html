   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04898_n2">1. The left side of the Grand
      Union Hotel letterhead reads: "[PASSENGERS] arriving in the city [of New York]
      via Grand Central [Depot, save] $3 Carriage Hire and [Transfer of] Baggage by
      stopping [at] the Grand Union Hotel, opposite said depot. Passengers arriving by
      West Shore Rail Road, via Weehawken Ferry, by taking the 42d street Horse Cars
      at Ferry entrance, reach Grand Union Hotel in ten minutes for 5 cents, and save
      $3 Carriage Hire." The right side reads: "600 Elegant Rooms, $1 and upwards per
      day. European Plan. Elevators, Restaurant, Café, Lunch and Wine Rooms,
      supplied with the best. Prices moderate. Families can live better for less money
      at the Grand Union than at any other strictly first class hotel in the city.
      Guests' Baggage delivered to and from Grand Central Depot, free." Missing text,
      indicated in brackets, has been supplied from a hotel circular published on <em>Making of America Books</em>.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.04898_n1">2. The rest of this letter has
      been torn away. Whitman crossed out the letter and wrote a series of notes on
      the back.<a href="#r2">[back]
