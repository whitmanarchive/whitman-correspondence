      Dear W.W:
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      The German Grashalme rec'd! How honors thicken &amp; cluster. 
      This book is a remarkable step forward. Do you know it gave me a curious (perhaps
      to you not altogether 
      intelligible) feeling as I read yr familiar poems in the foreign tongue I have so
      long been reading. 
      I seemed to see to feel <u>you</u> doubled, foreignized, <u>speaking</u> 
      over there the same message to a new nation; &amp; I also imagined this as but the beginning
      of a long 
      pilgrimage you are to make around the world, 
      uttering yr gospel in the thousand tongues of men. 
      It was a very [
      <span class="unclear">familiar?</span>]
       feeling &amp; 
      something grand &amp; thrilling in its forecast, or phophecy-tinge.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I give you here an accurate line for line translation of all of Knortz's<sup><a href="#uva.00476_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> and Rolleston's<sup><a href="#n1027" id="r3">3</a></sup> prefaces although 
      I don't deem them worth much (for novelty) except the inevitable biographical summary
      of Rolleston. The translations 
      are <u>very well</u> done. The German tongue (flexible, many-inflected, wide ranging language) 
      lends itself admirably to yr long sentences. They have               
            
      translated the very best of the poems for foreign presentation, I think. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p> 
      Do you know anything abt how Rolleston came to be so good a German scholar? Studied
      in Germany when a boy doubtless? 
      Do you know whether he or Knortz is married? 
      
   </p>    
   
   <p>
      Give my love to Dr. B.<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      You can make any use you want to of the transl. tho' I merely made it for you.

      My Dear W Whitman,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Yr letter &amp; papers both rec'd with thanks. I have written lately one of the most elaborate
      things I ever
      did—on the nature of poetry—going deep down, canvassing all nature for analogies (Ruskin's
      five vols 
      of Mod Painters helping me much) going over all the poets, &amp; taking yr Burial Hymn
      of Lincoln as the 
      model of the poetical style of the future. My article is 
      <u>scientific</u>, I even reverently analyze Shakespeare's technique &amp; 
      <u>prove</u> that he inclined more &amp; more to 
      prose, abandoning rhyme. I show that yr long twenty syllable, &amp; twenty-five syllable
      lines are the first true 
      heroics ever written 
          
      in a Germanic tongue and that while rhymes &amp; the [
      <span class="unclear">lang-tints?</span>]
      
      of verse will continue, you have revolutionized the technique of the drama &amp; the epic.
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I am [
      <span class="unclear">cunning?</span>]
       on acct of our enemies, &amp; only 
      introduce my great friend—yourself—at the close, when I have cut the other poets to
      pieces &amp; have interrogated
      Nature &amp; compared the two—herself &amp; the poets.  
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I had been reserving this piece of work until I moved into my new house. I 
      married a darling little wife six months ago &amp; she &amp; I have built a pretty cottage
      in Belmont—on the hill magnificent 
      view, at night the illuminated world of Boston twinkling below us—the revolving "Boston
      Light" out—flashing away in the harbor, 
      lime-lights bright &amp; numerous. By day birds and squirrels in the numerous cedars at
      our door—a perfect forest 
      of Virginia cedars. We have half an acre with trees (wild) &amp; are in <u>complete solitude</u> in our eyrie, no neighbors 
      within sight, except through the trees. Is not this tempting? 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      And now does it not tempt you to come and see me? Let me <u>beg of you</u> if you come to Boston, to let me know at once, 
      &amp; I will escort you out, &amp; instal you in our prophet's chamber, where there is a fireplace, 
      &amp; a great prospect, with deserted woodland walks <u>right at hand.</u> Will you promise? Write &amp; tell me. Mrs K. goes in to the city 
      every day, so we shd have the day to ourselves, I also go in nearly every day, &amp; you
      cd have the house to yourself much of 
      the time. Do come &amp; stay two weeks if you can. We have no girl (servant) to bore us.
      I am a little nobody, but I reverence you, 
      &amp; that sheds a little borrowed greatness on me. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I sent my article on poetry to the Century. They ordered an article on E.E. Hale,
      wh. I have sent also. I have a splendid
      [
      <span class="unclear">plum?</span>]
       for you in that. Hale wrote an appreciative review of yr first book in '56 also
      in the North American &amp; he told me that he thought he shd stand by every word of it
      to-day, but that's nothing, after all.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="uva.00476_n1">2. Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n1027">3. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
