      as before—have been half sick a great part of this winter—yet every
      thing goes on comfortably with me—I am sitting here by the window down stairs,
      in my big chair, writing this—(the sun shining outside, &amp; my little canary
      singing furiously in his cage in the corner)—I have occasional
      visitors—Wm Duckett<sup><a href="#med.00747_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> is here yet—I don't get
      out much, the roads are so bad. Come up &amp; see us &amp; spend the day.
      George<sup><a href="#n0852c" id="r4">4</a></sup> stop when you come up. Susan I enclose a letter

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03927_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Mrs: Susan Stafford | Kirkwood | (Glendale) | New Jersey. It is postmarked:
      Camden | Mar | [
      <span class="unclear">2?</span>]
      
      | 8 PM | 188[illegible] | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03927_n2">2. The year of 1887 appears
      to be a plausible date. In his Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.) on February 25 Whitman wrote: "Half sick (or more than half) most of this
      month." However, he sold his nag and bought a mare from Edwin Stafford in March
      1886 (see the letter from Whitman to John Burroughs of ); it is perhaps strange that he considered selling the
      mare a year later. The whereabouts of Duckett is not easy to trace since he held
      and gave up jobs frequently. On March 1, 1887, Whitman noted in his Commonplace
      Book: "W D still at Sewell practising."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="med.00747_n1">3. William H. Duckett,
      Whitman's young Camden friend, who drove the poet's horse and buggy, lived for a
      while in Whitman's house, and accompanied Whitman on numerous trips.<a href="#r3">[back]

      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
