      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I ought to have written to you before, acknowledging the good package of books, duly
      received by express, &amp; actively used since, changing them around in places where most
      needed among the soldiers—(I found a small hospital of U. S. teamsters, entirely without
      reading, I go there considerable, &amp; have given them largely of your reading contribution)—I
      am down here pretty well toward the extreme front of the Army, eight or ten miles
      south of headquarters, (Brandy Station)—We had some fighting here, below here on picket
      lines, day before yesterday—We feared they, the rebs, were advancing upon us in our
      depleted condition, especially feared their making a flank movement up on our right.
      We were all ready to skedaddle from here last night, &amp; expected it—horses harnessed
      in all directions, &amp; traps packed up, (we have held &amp; lost Culpepper three or four
      times already)—but I was very sleepy &amp; laid down &amp; went to sleep, never slept fresher
      or sweeter—but orders came during the night to stay for the present, there was no
      danger—during the night I heard tremendous yells, I got up &amp; went out, &amp; found it
      was some of the men returning from the extreme front—As day before yesterday a strong
      force, three corps, were moved down there—These were portions of them now returning—it
      was a curious sight to see the shadowy columns coming in two or three o'clock at night—I
      talked with the men—how good, how cheerful, how full of manliness &amp; good nature our
      American young men are—I staid last night at the house of a real secesh woman, Mrs.
      Ashby—her husband (dead) a near relation of the famous reb Gen Ashby<sup><a href="#med.00305_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—she gave me a good supper &amp; bed—There was quite a squad of our officers there—she
      &amp; her sister paid me the compliment of talking friendlily &amp; nearly altogether exclusively
      with me—she was dressed in very faded clothes but her manners were fine, seems to
      be a travelled educated woman—quite melancholy—said she had remained through fearful
      troubles &amp; changes here on acct of her children—she is a handsome middle-aged woman—poor
      lady, how I pitied her, compelled to live as one may say on chance &amp; charity, with
      her high spirit—
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear friend, I am moving around here among the field hospitals—(O how the poor young
      men suffer)—&amp; to see more of camp life &amp; war scenes, &amp; the state of the army this
      winter—Dear friend, I have much to tell you, but must abruptly close—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Townsend Trowbridge
      was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
      Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
      Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
      Eldridge edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He again met Whitman
      in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Secretary Chase in order to
      gather material for his biography, <em>The Ferry Boy and the
         Financier</em> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described their meetings
      in <em>My Own Story, with recollections of noted persons</em>
      (Boston: Houghton and Mifflin, 1903), 360–401. On December 11, Trowbridge
      had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending Whitman; see the letter
      from 
      . Though Trowbridge was
      not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to O'Connor in 1867: "Every year confirms
      my earliest impression, that no book has approached the power and greatness of
      this book, since the Lear and Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A. Coleman,
      "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <em>American Literature</em>, 23
      [1951–52], 327). For Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Rowman
      and Littlefield, 1961], 3:506. See also Coleman, "Trowbridge and Whitman," <em>Publications of the Modern Language Association of America
         [PMLA]</em>, 63 (1948): 262–273. For several weeks in 1863, Trowbridge
      stayed with Whitman in Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William
      D. O'Connor.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00305_n2">1. Turner Ashby
      (1828–1862), Confederate cavalry officer, was killed on June 6, 1862,
      while he fought a rear-guard action for Stonewall Jackson's troops. This
      sentence does not appear in the Stanford transcription.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="med.00305_n3">2. Trowbridge replied, on
      February 12 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Company,
      1906–1996], 2:524), that Babbitt had left the hospital in late December,
      and that he had heard from another soldier-patient that Babbitt had regained
      "his strength, though not his voice." Trowbridge also reported that he had
      written "a few days ago" to Chase on Whitman's behalf, and that Chase had
      received the book—evidently the copy of <em>Drummer Boy</em>
      referred to in the letter from
