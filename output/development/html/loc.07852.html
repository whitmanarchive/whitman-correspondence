   <p>Please bind up in the same style as formerly, exactly same &amp; sort (copy herewith)
      one hundred and fifty (150) copies big book complete works, with plates &amp;c:
      &amp; the rest (the sheets) fold up, with plates put in, all carefully done, &amp;
      each copy neatly tied with good cord, so as to be ready at once when wanted. You have
      there all the plates I believe. I will furnish you the first sheets, for the whole,
      with autograph, wh' I have here—will also furnish you with back labels.
