      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt; 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Heigho! Midwinter again. And snow—ground all covered. Perhaps its the last
      slap. I pray the gods—so make it be. Seven sparrows are out on the naked limbs
      of the tree—all huddled up. Yesterday I threw them a crumb, &amp; they all
      jumped down &amp; had a big fight for it. They seem the quintessence of selfishness—more
      greedy
      than pigs. When me thinks of the solemn great creator of the universe making such
      funny, spiteful little "animated torrid zones"<sup><a href="#loc.03182_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; covering them with feathers—it
      seems as if our Church deacons were off the track."Mebbe no, &amp;
      mebby yes," quoth my Italian.
   </p>
   
   <p>I sent Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r3">3</a></sup> the <u>Register</u> with
      report of my modeling in the church.
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>I'm working on my cast for the indication of the "spirit and the means" for the next
      stroke of
      fortune.
   </p>
   
   <p>Glad to hear of the completion of the portrait. I am anxious to see it.</p>
   
   <p>I've worked on my story some of late, &amp; have all done but the last 3 chapters. I
      fear my hero belongs to an impossible age.
   </p>
   
   <p>Yes, I think New York State good, &amp; Canada, I believe, would be good also. What
      'hinders my going over the whole country? I'd like to go South—I believe I
      could tell Southern people a good deal about the North. I've got, say, ten years
      before me. When I get an <u>idee</u> I could stop &amp; model it. My
      health is "boss," &amp; I feel like raging about.
   </p>
   
   <p>Keep so, so. I shall be along in time, &amp; talk you tired—</p>
   
   <p>Regards to Mrs. D.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.
