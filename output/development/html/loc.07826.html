   <p>Pleasant and sufficiently cool &amp; breezy to-day, (after some exhaustingly hot
      weather lately, but I am here ab't the same after it all)—Dr John Johnston<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r2">2</a></sup> f'm Bolton, England, has been here three or four days, &amp; I
      have seen quite a good deal of him &amp; like him well—I believe he intends to
      go to Ontario &amp; call upon you—I am sure you will be interested in
      him—he is a great reader &amp;c of L of G—he yesterday went to Brooklyn,
      to visit Andrew<sup><a href="#loc.04931_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>" and Tom Rome<sup><a href="#loc.07826_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; intends going down to
      Huntington L I to visit Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Sh'd suppose he
      might come y'r way ab't a week or thereab't fr'm now—

   <p>J A Symonds<sup><a href="#n0615" id="r6">6</a></sup> has sent me his (formidable) finely printed "<em>Essays Speculative &amp; Suggestive</em>," <em>two
         Vols. duodecimo</em>, <em>Chapman &amp; Hall</em>, <em>London</em>—one essay being devoted to me, "<em>Democratic Art</em>, <em>with special reference to
         Walt Whitman</em>"—Have run it over &amp; a few other pages—I guess
      there is meat in the vols. but I doubt whether he has gripp'd "democratic art" by
      the nuts, or L of G. either<sup><a href="#loc.07826_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup>—then the pretty
      magazine here "<em>Poet Lore</em>" for July 15, (Lippincott, Phila:)
      has an article "<em>Walt Whitman's View of Shakspere</em>," signed <em>Jonathan Trumbull</em>, very friendly respectful &amp;
      complimentary to me—but dont get to marrows hardly at all<sup><a href="#loc.07826_n4" id="r8">8</a></sup>—

      big whistle has sounded 1 o'clock—my good nurse Warry<sup><a href="#loc.00668_n4" id="r11">11</a></sup> has just bro't me some nice ice cream, wh' I have duly
      eaten—A N Y man has offered me $100 for a novel (shortish story, 5000

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4102">2. John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,

   <p id="loc.04931_n2">3. Andrew Rome, perhaps with
      the help of his brother Tom, printed Whitman's first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1855) in a small shop on the
      intersection of Fulton and Cranberry in Brooklyn. It was likely the first book

   <p id="n0262">5. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <p id="n0615">6. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07826_n3">7. Whitman commented on
      Symonds' chapter from <em>Essays Speculative and Suggestive</em>
      (London: Chapman and Hall, 1890), 237-268, in "An Old Man's Rejoinder," which
      appeared in <em>The Critic</em> 17 (16 August 1890): 85-86.
      Whitman's "Rejoinder" was reprinted in <em>Good-Bye My Fancy</em>
      (see <em>Prose Works</em> 2: 655-658). In his  letter, Bucke remarked: "The whole
      article is 'flat, stale and unprofitable'—a saw dust chewing
      business—dealing with the hull, the shell, the superfices, never for one
      line, one flash of insight penetrating to the heart of the business." On , Whitman observed: "you are a little more
      severe on Symonds than I sh'd be."<a href="#r7">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">9. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="loc.05893_n1">10. Traubel founded <em>The Conservator</em> in March 1890, and he remained its editor
      and publisher until his death in 1919. Traubel conceived <em>The
         Conservator</em> as a liberal periodical influenced by Whitman's poetic and
      political ethos. A fair portion of its contents were devoted to Whitman
      appreciation and the conservation of the poet's literary and personal
      reputation.<a href="#r10">[back]

   <p id="loc.00668_n4">11. Frederick Warren Fritzinger
      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,
      535).<a href="#r11">[back]

      Philadelphia <em>Press</em>, made the proposal on . According to the poet's <em>Commonplace Book</em>, he sent "A Death-Bouquet" to File of the New York
      <em>Sun</em>; he received $10 for it. Edwin haviland Miller
      says that "A Death-Bouquet" appeared in the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> on February 2. Whitman mentions the publication in his  letter to Bucke. However, Floyd
      Stovall claims not to have found it there in his edition of the <em>Prose Works 1892</em>. "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf250r1">A Death-Bouquet</a>" became the last section of <em>Good-Bye My Fancy</em>, which was later reprinted in <em>Complete Prose Works</em> (1892).<a href="#r12">[back]
