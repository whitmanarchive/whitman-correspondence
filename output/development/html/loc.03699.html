   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03699_n2">1. The rest of this letterhead
      contains the following paragraph: "SALEM, N. J. is one of the stands forming the
      SOUTH JERSEY CIRCUIT—Salem, Bridgeton and Millville. Wilmington, Del., is
      just across the river from Salem, and Companies can thus make out a good route
      via. Wilmington to the South, North or West. Wilmington is but two hours by
      Steamer from Salem. SALEM, a manufacturing city of 6000 population, is an
      Excellent Show Town, surrounded by a good country. Salem is 32 miles from
      Philadelphia, and has 6 trains each way daily. The Salem Opera House will seat
      900 people; has new scenery and plenty of it; stage opening 25 feet; piano
      furnished with house; gas; has 5 double dressing rooms, and all the conveniences
      to be found in first-class Theatres. ☞ The best Companies played here last
      season to good business. The Managers will book only two Companies a week. We
      show our faith in Salem as a Show Town by preferring to share with good
      attractions. Address SMITH &amp; STARR, Lessees and Managers.<a href="#r1">[back]
