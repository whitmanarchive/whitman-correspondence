   <p>I have been very sick for many months—&amp; am still unable to work or go round—But think
      I shall recover yet. I send you a paper same mail with this, 
      containing a little piece that describes my case. I rec'd your letter of last June—have not only been sick, but in much trouble &amp; affliction
      all summer—&amp; I now write at a venture to see whether you are in Warren—&amp; if so you
      must write to me at once. I have not forgotten you, my loving soldier boy, &amp; never
      shall.
