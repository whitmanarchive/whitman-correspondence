   <p>After I sent your note in answer yesterday—&amp; reading yours again—I
      have perpetrated this—do I understand you are to have a long varied Blaine
      melange like in sections—the Presidential canvas business, of course? If so
      you might find a spot in the course of it all, where this [
      <span class="unclear">screed?</span>]
       may come
      in<sup><a href="#col.00012_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>—If that don't suit you, or is not practicable (though I hope it will be, as I should
      like it just as well) print it by itself, like the little piece of Friday
      last.<sup><a href="#col.00012_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>—I will call about 10. this evening to see proof.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Talcott Williams
      (1849–1928) was associated with the New York <em>Sun</em>
      and <em>World</em> as well as the Springfield <em>Republican</em> before he became the editor of the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in 1879. His newspaper vigorously defended Whitman
      in news articles and editorials after the Boston censorship of 1882. For more
      information about Williams, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_108.html">Williams, Talcott (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
