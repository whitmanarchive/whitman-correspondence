      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>As you have given me permission I have taken the liberty to address you as above,
      and I assure you I fully reciprocate your friendship as expressed in your letter and
      it will afford me great pleasure to meet you after the war will have terminated or
      sooner if circumstances will permit.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am much pleased that Lewy<sup><a href="#nyp.00138_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> is so cheerful and happy, and I trust he will be successful in his hopes and desires
      and be prosperous and happy and enjoy life to a good old age. I am sorry very sorry
      that Hiram has not improved.<sup><a href="#nyp.00138_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> I was in hopes that ere this he would be sufficiently recovered to go Home and I
      sincerly hope that it will not be long until he can do so. It is [my] sincere wish that Johny
      Makey<sup><a href="#nyp.00138_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> will survive the operation and ultimately recover. I hope you will be more fortunate
      and procure a good berth, and be ever prosperous. We in the Army feel our reserves
      at Charleston and Vicksburg very deeply as yet we have not had a chance to strike
      a blow in our vicinity but as you say that time is near at hand and I hope we will
      be successful at any rate we will do out utmost and endeavor to give the Rebels the
      biggest thrashing they have yet received. Let the Government Officials in Washington
      mind their own biz. let Hooker<sup><a href="#nyp.00138_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> alone and the Army of the Potomac will be triuimphant but as long as they will continue to interfere with our Gen[era]ls arrangements,
      dictate to him when he shall move, and when he shall halt, just so long will the Army
      of the Potomac be of little avail. It is composed of good material, and all ready
      for a forward movement. then let Hooker have the reins, and he will soon drive the
      Rebs to Richmond and far beyond it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Yes my dear Brother, You have my friendship as fully as you can desire, and I hope
      we will meet again.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Having nothing more of importance to communicate, I will conclude with my best wishes
      for your health and happiness and believe me to be
      <br></br>Yours sincerly,
      <br></br>Thos P. Sawyer

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00138_n2">1. Lewis Kirke Brown
      (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
      August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
      transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in
      February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on
      February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come
      and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on
      January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary
      (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was employed in the
      Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's letter from 
      . The following
      September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief
      of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until his retirement
      in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was prepared by Brown's
      family and is now held in the Library of Congress.)<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00138_n3">2. Hiram Sholes lay next to
      Lewis K. Brown in Armory Square Hospital, according to Sholes's letter to Walt
      Whitman on May 24, 1867 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection); see also "Letter from
      Walt Whitman to Hiram Sholes, May 30, 1867" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:331–332). Charles I. Glicksberg, ed., (<em>Walt Whitman and the Civil War</em> [Philadelphia: University of
      Pennsylvania Press, 1933], 155) records: "Hiram Scholis—bed 3—Ward E.—26th N.
      York—wants some pickles—a bottle of pickles."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00138_n4">3. John Mahay, private in
      Company A of the 101st New York, was wounded in the bladder at second Bull Run,
      August 29, 1862, and held on for fifteen months at Armory Square Hospital before
      dying in 1864. "Poor Mahay," Whitman writes in <em>Specimen
         Days</em>, "a mere boy in age, but old in misfortune" (Richard Maurice
      Bucke, ed., <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>, 10
      vols. (New York, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902). Whitman notes that Mahay, despite
      his pain, "was of good heart" and "was delighted with a stick of horehound candy
      I gave him" (4:46). Mahay is referred to as in poor health in letters from
      Whitman to Lewis K. Brown from 
       and 
      . See also Charles I.

   <p id="nyp.00138_n5">4. General Joseph Hooker
      (1814–1879) assumed command of the Army of the Potomac on January 25,
      1863, after President Lincoln had removed General Burnside from command.
      Hooker's name was most (in)famously associated with the Battle of
      Chancellorsville (Virginia), where a Union army of 130,000 men was defeated by
      General Robert E. Lee's 60,000 Confederates.<a href="#r4">[back]
