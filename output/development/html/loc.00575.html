   <p>We sent you yesterday copy of Banner of Light [
      <span class="unclear">cent'y?</span>]
       critique on Leaves Grass written by Gen. Canning Hill,<sup><a href="#loc.00575_n101" id="r1">1</a></sup>—He appreciates the Poems &amp; <u>you</u> too.<sup><a href="#loc.00575_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Be assured he speaks truthfully and just as he believes &amp; feels.—
   </p> 
   
   <p>By the bye, will you please write for our consideration terms of contract for publishing
      L of G.?  We have been expecting said document, and now wish to have it adjusted as
      early as possible if agreeable to yourself.  Inasmuch as <u>our</u> "writing" has been submitted to you, <u>your</u> "writing" submitted to us will accommodate us if sent early.—We have so many things
      to think of that we would like to dispose of this contract &amp; "go on our way rejoicing".—Regards
      to Mr. Clapp<sup><a href="#loc.00575_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—&amp; for yourself the "fraternals" of Thayer &amp; Eldridge.  
      <u>I</u> think that Mrs. Beachs's criticism is just about the damndest piece of scolding ever written by a woman who
      does not know what she is talking about.<sup><a href="#loc.00575_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> My wife was <u>indignant</u>, and I should not wonder if she wrote a reply to it.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Wilde Thayer was
      one half of Thayer and Eldridge, the Boston publishing firm responsible for the
      third edition of Walt Whitman's <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00575_n101">1. George Canning Hill had
      managed the <em>Boston Daily Ledger</em> from its founding in 1856
      until its merger with the <em>Boston Herald</em> in 1859. Thayer
      &amp; Eldridge had reprinted his novel <em>Amy Lee</em> early in
      1860.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00575_n2">2. The review Thayer and
      Eldridge sent to Whitman appeared in the <em>Boston Banner of
         Light</em> (2 June 1860). See "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1860/anc.00037.html">Leaves Of Grass By Walt Whitman. Boston: Thayer And Eldridge</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00575_n3">3. Henry Clapp
      (1814–1875) Jr., was a journalist, editor and reformer. Whitman and Clapp
      most likely met in Charles Pfaff's beer cellar, located in lower Manhattan.
      Clapp, who founded the literary weekly the <em>Saturday Press</em>
      in 1858, was instrumental in promoting Whitman's poetry and celebrity; over
      twenty items on Whitman appeared in the <em>Press</em> before the
      periodical folded (for the first time) in 1860. Of Clapp Whitman told Horace
      Traubel, "You will have to know something about Henry Clapp if you want to know
      all about me." (For Whitman's thoughts on Clapp, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.60.html">Sunday, May 27, 1888</a>.")<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00575_n4">4. The review of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> that appeared in the <em>New-York Saturday Press</em> on June 2, 1860, was signed "Juliette H.
      Beach," but it had really been written by her husband, Calvin Beach. Expecting a
      favorable response, the editor of the <em>Saturday Press</em>,
      Henry Clapp, Jr., had forwarded a copy of Whitman's book to Juliette Beach for
      review. Her husband, however, angered that Clapp had sent the book to his wife,
      appropriated it and wrote a scathing review, which was published in his wife's
      name. In a letter to Clapp dated June 7, 1860, Juliette Beach explained the
      nature of the mistake and expressed her regret at not having had the opportunity
      to publish her own favorable opinion of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.
      In an attempt to undo some of the damage, Clapp printed a notice titled
      "Correction" in the subsequent issue of his newspaper, alongside three positive
      commentaries on <em>Leaves of Grass</em> by women. For Calvin
      Beach's review of the 1860 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1860/anc.00039.html">Leaves of Grass</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
