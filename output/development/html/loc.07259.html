   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07259_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey U.S.A. It is postmarked:
      LONDON | PM | OC 25 | 88 | CANADA; CAMDEN, N.J. | OCT | 27 | [illegible]AM | [illegible] | REC'D.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.07259_n2">2. A review of <em>November Boughs </em>by Melville Phillips appeared in the
      October 21, 1888, issue of the Philadelphia <em>Press</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07259_n3">3. Whitman mentions <em>Lippincott's</em> to Horace Traubel on October 24, 1888: "The
      whole of that Rebel editor's diary appears in the November issue. I sent it to
      Dr. Bucke—tore out the leaves: rolled the rest of the magazine up with
      some other papers and mailed it to the Asylum. You know, I send a bundle of
      stuff—papers, odds and ends—every week"(see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.102.html">Wednesday, October 24, 1888</a>). The November 1888 issue of <em>Lippincott's</em> published "Extracts from the Diary of John
      R. Thompson." John Reuben Thompson (1823—1873) was an editor, journalist,
      and poet from Richmond, Virginia; he edited the <em>Literary
         Messenger and Southern Field and Fireside</em> before going to England in
      1864 to become the head writer for the <em>Index</em>, the organ
      of Confederate opinion in England. From 1867 until his death, he was literary
      editor of the <em>New York Evening Post</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
