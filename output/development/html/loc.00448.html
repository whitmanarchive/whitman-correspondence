      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother George
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I must beg pardon for my seeming delay abt sending the enclosed draft. But I have had so much bad luck lately in one thing and
      another that I could not do it sooner
   </p>
   
   <p>I have made the draft for $510<sup><a href="#loc.00448_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I wish you would give the $10 to Mother as a present from Mattie
   </p>
   
   <p>Mat is pretty bad yet<sup><a href="#loc.00448_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—can just get around a little—very lame—but I think 'twill get away in a week or two
      if we have no more of the same sort—It pains me very much to see her try to walk—but
      she stands it like a good fellow—dont grumble a bit &nbsp;I hope you have been occasioned no inconvenience by my failure to
      send you this on the 1st of the month &nbsp;I meant to have done it but could not get matters
      into shape to do it till to-day—please write in regard to [receipt?] of this draft
      so that I may know that it came to hand safely &nbsp;I believe I wrote to you or mother
      that Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00448_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> would take the draft after you endorsed it and put it in his bank and draw the money
      for you—twill save you some trouble probably—
   </p>
   
   <p>We are quite anxious to hear from Mother and the rest of you—Mat has tried to write
      once or twice but does not succeed—she will make an effort to-day I believe—
   </p>
   
   <p>We are having the most delight[ful] weather here just now except that it is very dry
      indeed—yet we are having a little shower this morning. I hope it will be a good one
      for we need rain—we have great troub[le]s in carrying on our work the dirt is so dry—bad
      weather for building Reservoirs<sup><a href="#loc.00448_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>How do matters go with you—is the 48 inch pipe all laid yet<sup><a href="#loc.00448_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I wish you would write me occasionaly and I often wonder why Mr Lane or McNamee<sup><a href="#loc.00448_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> does not write me—certainly they are in my debt for letters—I shall give em fits
      if I ever get on east again—
   </p>
   
   <p>The first time you are at Mr Lanes Office I wish you would ask Johny [M. McMear?]<sup><a href="#loc.00448_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> if he will see what taxes &amp;c are due on that lot of mine on Flatbush Av and write
      me and I will send him a draft if he will pay it for me—or if he will give you the
      statement you can write me and I will send it to you
   </p>
   
   <p>I should judge from Mothers letter that she thought you would move—do you really think
      that you will abandon old 1194<sup><a href="#loc.00448_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>—You must keep me posted—Do you ever hear from Walt—I wish he would write me occasionaly—Love to Mother and all—affectionately your

   <p id="loc.00448_n1">1. George was building
      hosues on speculation at this time and needed substantial amounts of cash. By
      June 23, 1869, he had borrowed $3,400 from Jeff (Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to
      Walt Whitman [Trent Collection, William R. Perkins Library, Duke
      University]).<a href="#r1">[back]

      from a buggy on July 30, she suffered a badly bruised hip; only Jeff's quick
      thinking prevented a more serious accident. For a full account of this event,
