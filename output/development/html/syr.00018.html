      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I write to tell you how things are going now about the translation, &amp;c. It is nearly
      through its last stage. Our way of working
      is this. First I translated all I am going to give as well as I could out of my own
      unassisted resources and handed over the M.S. to my colleague. He then read it
      over carefully with the English text &amp; made such notes &amp; corrections as occurred
      to him. Then he handed the notes &amp; M.S. back to me. All this is now done, &amp; at
      present I spend the evening in reading a portion of the transl. with his notes,
      &amp; considering all carefully—next morning I visit my colleague &amp; we go over what
      I prepared the previous night, weighing every sentence; and give final shape to
      the translation. In the afternoon I write out for the printer what we have done in
      the morning. I have now ready for print the Song of Myself, Starting from Paumanok,
      I Sing the Body Electric, Song of the Open Road, Brooklyn Ferry, and a
      dozen or so of the shorter poems. We were at work this morning on 'Salut au Monde.'
   </p>
   
   <p>As to publishing, I am trying to get a Dresden  man, Heinrich Minden, to take it
      upon commission. He is now away in Moskow, on business, but returns in a few days. I
      have written to broach the matter. Curious fact illustrative of rule in Russia—I
      wanted to send Minden my transl. of 'Starting from Paumanok,' with my preface to
      the work and Freiligrath's<sup><a href="#n0248" id="r1">1</a></sup> article from the Allg. Zeitung. But
      they told me at his office that if I ever wished to see these things again I had
      better not despatch them—as this highly revolutionary or explosive literature
      would assuredly be confiscated on the frontier by the Russian police! So I left them
      in the office, where I suppose they will label them 'dangerous,' and put them on an
      upper shelf till Minden comes back. 
   </p>
   
   <p> The German colleague I alluded to is not a partner in the strict sense &amp; takes
      no part in the publication of the work, nor has legal responsibility for it. His
      name is Gustav Adolf Israel<sup><a href="#syr.00018_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—he is master for
      German literature in a school here—I have known him for long, &amp; knowing his
      capacities engaged him for a fixed sum of money to revise my M.S.S.. You must not let
      his name be known—it would have serious consequences for him if he were known to
      have taken any part in the production  of the L. of G. No one supposes
      that the book will be much of a success, financially speaking. A bookseller told me
      the other day that no one reads poetry now in Germany, or buys it, except to give
      pretty books as presents to young ladies on their confirmation. But then as a
      leading critical organ here, anent my lecture, asserted that the L. of G. are not
      poetry, perhaps there is a chance for them! I have not gone into detailed criticism
      in my preface—said that if anyone didn't see his way to calling the book 'poetry,'
      he might call it by any other earthly name he liked, if he would only begin to
      listen to it. Gave a sketch of your life, in which I have corrected some mistakes
      I
      made in my lecture, &amp; gave your letter, i.e. the portion you wrote for this
      purpose. I mean to give the English text, but not on alternate
      pages—underneath, in smaller type, on the bottom ⅓rd of the page, so as to
      give the idea that it is there for reference, making the German rendering the main
      thing, as it should be for German readers. But this is a good deal dependent on the
      publisher &amp; his opinion. We are thinking of leaving Germany about the middle of
      September. My address then will be Glasshouse, Shinrone, Ireland. This  indeed is always
      sure to find me. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall be glad to get among my own people again, &amp; to have a bit of a holiday
      too, for I have been working pretty hard all this summer. I hope you are well and
      prospering. 
   </p>
   
   <p> As soon as there is further definite news about the L. of G. translation I'll let
      you know—meantime goodbye.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0248">1. Ferdinand Freiligrath (1810–1876) was a German
      poet and translator and friend of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In his  letter to Rudolf Schmidt, Whitman
      wrote that Freiligrath "translates &amp; commends my poems." His review in the
      Augsburg <em>Allgemeinen Zeitung</em> on April 24, 1868 (reprinted
      in his <em>Gesammelte Dichtungen</em> [Stuttgart: G. J. Göschen,
      1871], 4:86–89), was among the first notices of Whitman's poetry on the
      continent. A translation of the article appeared in the <em>New
         Eclectic Magazine</em>, 2 (July 1868), 325–329; see also Gay Wilson
      Allen, <em>Walt Whitman Abroad</em> (Syracuse: Syracuse University
      Press, 1955), 3–7. A digital version is available in Walter Grünzweig's
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/german/introduction.html">Whitman in the German-Speaking Countries</a>," which collects several
      examples of German reception of Whitman's poetry. Freiligrath had promised his
      readers "some translated specimens of the poet's productions," not a complete
      translation. William D. O'Connor and Whitman were applying pressure. A
      sympathetic article on Whitman in the New York <em>Sontagsblatt</em> of November 1, 1868, mentioned Freiligrath's admiration
      for the American poet. A translation of this article, which Whitman had a
      Washington friend prepare, is now in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.<a href="#r1">[back]
