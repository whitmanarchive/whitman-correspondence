   </p>
   
   <p>I was delighted to get yours of the 7th,<sup><a href="#loc.03348_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> with the welcome <u>November Boughs</u>.<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r3">3</a></sup> My eye is now under battery treatment
      (assault-and-battery treatment, you would think to look at it!)<sup><a href="#loc.03348_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> and just as soon as
      I can recover my sight a little better, I will plunge into the volume, which now
      invites me through a thick blur. I hope David McKay<sup><a href="#n4983" id="r5">5</a></sup> will do
      better with it than  he has done with your other books. I long for you to have a good
      publisher.

   <p>More anon.—The weather here has turned very cold, though bright, and I am
      barking with influenza. November bow-wows! (Isn't this insulting!)

   <p>I hope you keep comfortable. Nelly<sup><a href="#n3126" id="r6">6</a></sup> sends her love.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03348_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Mr. Walt Whitman, | No. 328 Mickle Street, | Camden, | New Jersey. It is
      postmarked: Washington, D.C. | Oct 9 | 830 PM | 88; Camden, N.J. | Oct | 10 |
      6AM | 1888 | Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.03348_n2">2. O'Connor is referring to
      Whitman's letter of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">3. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03348_n3">4. In his letter of , O'Connor offers more details on
      the condition of his eye: "The pleasing little malady of the eyelid which has
      inspired me to much eloquent, though silent, profanity, is called ptosis, . . .
      and consists in a paralysis of the first nerve of the eyelid."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4983">5. David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3126">6. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years, and he speaks often in his letters of their daughter Jean, by nickname
      "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break in late
      1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated black citizens,
      Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence between Whitman and
      Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For
      more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see also Dashae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
