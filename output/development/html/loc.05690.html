      <br></br>Dear Sir: 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your letter of the 11th inst. to-day and take my translation up till the first quotation on page 180. I have been
      quite unwell for the last 3 or 4 days otherwise I should have finished the whole article.
      Hoping that it may be of use to you, and that you will remember that I have only been
      here in this country 7 years, and therefore will excuse the many mistakes I have made,
      I am, fin.,
   </p>

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Emil Arctander, who was
      acting vice-consul for Denmark, translated Schmidt's article for Walt Whitman.
      According to his letters of June 17 and 20, 1872, (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.), Arctander did not complete his self-styled "weak translation"
      until later in the month. The translation, with scores of corrections in Walt
      Whitman's hand, is in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.
