   <p>I hope that Londoners will buy the 100 copies of big book—there is not much

   <p>Be sure and tell me when Lippincotts print the piece you sent them—or send me a

      any special utterance of his in re "The Leaves"<sup><a href="#loc.07348_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> Is there
      any way of getting hold of what he and the Boston man said—Any thing really
      good and strong from Tennyson would be quite a benefit and help to us

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
