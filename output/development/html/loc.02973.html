      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I think every one of these dreadful attacks leaves William<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      worse. He has not yet recovered his balance, &amp; is all mixed in his mind. He is also
      very weak in body. He is very restless at times after the attack passes off. This
      last period did not seem so severe, &amp; yet the result has been prolonged. It is most
      bad &amp; pitiful, &amp; I am glad you can't see him.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      with love—
      <br></br>N.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
