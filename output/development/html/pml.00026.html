      <br></br><br></br>Dear Abby,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall come on in the train that leaves here in the middle of the day, 
      to-morrow Tuesday, 15th, &amp; gets in New York at 10 at night—so I shall be up there
      by or before 11 to-morrow night—(<em>to-night</em> for you reading this.)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am really pleased that you can accommodate me, &amp; make great reckoning of being with
      you, 
      &amp; of my room, &amp;c—but wish [to] have it distinctly understood, in all friendship, 
      that I <em>pay</em> for <em>my room</em>, 
      &amp;c, just the same as any body else—<em>positively</em> 
      I will not come on any other terms—&amp; you must just let it be as I say this time—I
      have lots of money—in fact <em>untold wealth</em>—&amp; I shall not feel right
      if you undertake to alter this part of my programme—I am feeling well 
      &amp; hearty—I wish you to read my piece<sup><a href="#pml.00026_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> in the "Broadway London Magazine," 
      just out—it was written for you among the rest—In a few hours I shall be with you.
      
   </p>
