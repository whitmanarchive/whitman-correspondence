   <p>I will be at the Commemorative meeting. I would like to speak from ten to twenty minutes
      <em>before</em> Mr Phillips's address. What I have to offer might be called <em>A true Reminiscence of Thomas Paine</em>. I shall be to-morrow evening &amp; night, and all Friday, &amp; the following night &amp; forenoon,
      <em>at 1929 north 22d street, Phila</em>. (north of Berks)<sup><a href="#prc.00051_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—&amp; if it would be convenient for you to send a carriage <em>there</em> for me at about 1½ p m Sunday it would suit me—Call on or address me there Friday
      forenoon or evening, or Saturday forenoon before 12—
