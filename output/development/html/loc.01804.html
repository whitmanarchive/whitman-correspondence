   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George S. McWatters (1812?–1886) briefly spent time
      as a lawyer in Philadelphia and a gold prospector in California before joining
      the New York City police force in 1858. He also served on the U.S. Secret
      Service. His book <em>Detectives of Europe and America: or life in
         the Secret Service</em> was first published in 1877. His involvement with
      the Ladies' Union Relief Association began in the late 1860s during his tenure
      as policeman.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0129">1. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
