      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letters of 10th and 12th have come safe, &amp; are welcome—dear son, I see you
      are hard at work &amp; appear to be in lively spirits—I am glad to hear you practice
      with the Arithmetic—I wish you to try &amp; do a little with it every
      day—practice makes perfect—you will see how soon &amp; how clear it will all
      come to you—If you have the Geography or Atlas, look into that a little too—one
      needs to have an idea of the world too. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am concerned to hear of the death of Amos Dye—poor Amos—he was one of the
      first (I don't know but the very first) of the railroad men there I got acquainted
      with,
      &amp; rode with—Pete, if there is any further subscription for Mrs. Dye, I authorize
      you to put me down for $5—I will either send the money, or give it to her when I
      return—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall return in about three weeks. I am now in the eighth week of my furlough—it
      is
      seven weeks last Tuesday night since we parted there at the corner of 7th street.
      Well,
      Pete, dear loving boy, I must now close for to-day. 
   </p>

   <p>late Friday afternoon Sept. 16. </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear son, I have time to add only a few words, in order to put it in the mail this
      evening—I am working a while every day at my printing yet—but I go around
      considerable—still go out in the bay—&amp; enjoy myself among my friends
      here—&amp; in riding around, &amp;c—The weather is very fine, both days &amp;
      nights. I don't know whether I told you how I stand now about the war—suffice it to
      say, that as things have gone on, &amp; as the case stands, I find myself now far more
      for
      <em>the French</em> than I ever was for the Prussians<sup><a href="#loc.011532_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Then I propose to take my first drink with you when I return, in celebrations of the
      pegging out of the Pope &amp; all his gang of Cardinals &amp; priests—&amp; the
      entry of Victor Emanuel<sup><a href="#n0217" id="r3">3</a></sup> into Rome, &amp; making it the capital of the great independent
      Italian nation.<sup><a href="#loc.011532_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Good bye till next time, darling boy. </p>
   
   
   <p>Walt.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.011532_n1">1. This piece of correspondence is
      addressed, "Peter Doyle | Conductor, | Office | Wash. &amp; Georgetown City RR.
      Co. | Washington, | D. C." It is postmarked: "New-York | Sep | 16(?)|

   <p id="loc.011532_n2">2. In his  letter to Doyle, Whitman expressed support for the Prussian
      cause, labeling Louis Napoleon "the meanest scoundrel . . . that ever sat on a
      throne." In the New York <em>Evening Mail</em> on October 27,
      1870, the Washington correspondent reported: "At the commencement of the present
      war in Europe [Walt Whitman] was strongly German, but is now the ardent friend
      of the French, and enthusiastically supports them and their Republic" (Charles
      I. Glicksberg, <em>Walt Whitman and the Civil War</em>
      [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1933], 116<em>n</em>). Note also "O Star of France."<a href="#r2">[back]

      September 15, 1870, reported that the Papal troops were evacuating various towns
      and Papal states. On September 21, 1870, the forces of Italian King Victor
      Emanuel II (1820–1878) entered Rome without bloodshed, after "the Pope
      forbade any resistance." Victor Emanuel, whose reign had been marked by wars of
      Italian unification, established the capital of the newly unified Italy at Rome
      on July 2, 1871.<a href="#r3">[back]
