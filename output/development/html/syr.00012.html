      <br></br><br></br>Dear Poet,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been home and back again since I called upon you in Philadelphia last month.
      I
      often think of you and wish I could stay near you, that I might see and speak to you
      sometimes, however, I often read your poems and as Shelley has said, "Poetry is the
      record of the greatest happiest moments, of our greatest and best minds." Therefore
      in reading your book I feel that I have that which is greatest in you, but the heart
      
      
      
      will often rebel against the most logical conclusion, and thus with me I would like
      to be near you sometimes. I have only one other friend who has the same power over
      me, and that is he of whom I told you in Halifax. I was rather amused (when I told
      some of my friends at home that I had seen you), at the ideas they seemed to have
      of
      my object in calling on you. Some thought it was simply because you were a great
      man, and they gave me addresses of several well known men in Literature &amp;c.
      however, I told them
      
      
      
      these other men were not Walt Whitman and that the only others I would have crossed
      the Atlantic to see would have been <u>Emerson</u> and <u>Thoreau</u> both of whom are very dear to me.
   </p>
   
   <p>You may have forgotten all about me: indeed it would be surprising to find it
      otherwise; but it was not that you should know me, that I came, noâ€”I both <u>knew &amp; loved</u> you before, but I wanted to see &amp;
      speak to you. It might have been my friend as well as myself who called but I had
      the opportunity.
   </p>
   
   <p>I send you a book, that a friend in Glasgow, who is greatly taken with your "Leaves
      of Grass" asked me to send to you or take. I cannot very well leave my ship just
      now so I post it to you, he would have liked to have sent a more valuable
      
      
      
      book but he cannot afford it. I thought it very kind of him, I know he is a dear
      soft hearted fellow, and a splendid critic of English Literature. I will be here for
      8 days, and I would like very much to know if you are well.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad to be able to tell you that your number of readers in Scotland is
      greatly increased. They are beginning to understand your teaching much better
   </p>
   
   <p>I heard that Swinbourne
      ranks you third of living men. <u>Victor Hugo</u> I know is his
      great hero.
   </p>
