   <p>Showery &amp; coolish here the last two days—I am now sitting here by the open
      window—have had my dinner, eaten with relish—Sidney Morse<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r2">2</a></sup> is still here working—You shall see a photo of the figure
      he has made of me soon. Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r3">3</a></sup> is here in America.
      The news from O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r4">4</a></sup> is unfavorable. I suppose you rec'd the

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

   <p id="n0862">2. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
