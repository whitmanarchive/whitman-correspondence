      Transcript.<br><br>
      "Little Mitch," or Reuben Farwell, served with the Michigan Cavalry during
      the War and met Whitman in Armory Square Hospital early in 1864, and upon
      his release from the hospital he corresponded with Whitman. After Farwell
      received his discharge on August 24, 1864, he returned to his home in
      Plymouth, Michigan. Evidently the correspondence was renewed when Whitman
      sent a postcard on February 5, 1875. On , Farwell, who owned a farm in Michigan, wrote: "Walt my dear
      old Friend how I would like to grasp your hand and give you a kiss as I did
      in the days of yore. what a satisfaction it would be to me." In Farwell's
      last letter, on , he said that
      he was planning to leave shortly for California. He is mentioned in
      "Memoranda During the War"; see <em>The Complete Writings of
         Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Richard Maurice Bucke, Thomas B. Harned, and
      Horace L. Traubel (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902), 4:134. <br><br>
      The year is confirmed by the reference to Farwell's letter of . When Bucke wrote to Farwell
      after Walt Whitman's death, apparently only this one note, written "on the
      back of a circular," was extant.<a href="#r1">[back]
