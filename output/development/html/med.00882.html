   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00882_n1">1. Sir Edwin Arnold
      (1832–1904) was an English poet and journalist. He documented his visit to
      Whitman in an article entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00734.html">Sir Edwin Arnold and Whitman</a>" that was published anonymously in <em>The Springfield Republican</em> on November 7, 1891.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00882_n3">2. It is unclear what poem Daintrey has in mind; perhaps she has confused Whitman 
      with John Greenleaf Whittier, whose immensely popular "Barbara Frietchie" described
      the old woman from Frederick, Maryland, 
      who waved the Stars and Stripes while General Lee's and Stonewall Jackson's rebel
      troops marched by her window, as "Bravest of all in Frederick town."<a href="#r2">[back]
