   <p>Nothing very new—Am pretty well but have the grip again &amp; sore throat &amp;

   <p>Enclosed I send what I have just scratch'd off ab't the Hollandisk piece<sup><a href="#loc.07111_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> (I believe that's ab't the best word to nip &amp; print
      &amp; stick to)—It is quite a theme—quite significant—means a good
      deal to me &amp; <em>for me</em>—hope <em>the
         mood</em> will get hold of you one of these times soon—have just heard
      from Dr B[ucke]<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup>, all well—I am sitting here as usual in

   <p>I sh'd suggest <em>the Critic</em> for the Hollandisk

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07111_n3">1. William Sloane
      Kennedy's "Dutch Traits of Walt Whitman" was published in <em>The
         Conservator</em> 1 (February 1891): 90-91. It was reprinted in <em>In Re Walt Whitman</em>, 195-199.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
