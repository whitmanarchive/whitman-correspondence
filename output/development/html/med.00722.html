   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Redpath (1833–1891),
      an antislavery activist, journalist, and longtime friend of Whitman, was the
      author of <em>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown</em> (Boston:
      Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the <em>New York
         Tribune</em> during the war, and the originator of the "Lyceum" lectures. He
      met Whitman in Boston in 1860 and remained an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 9
      vols., 3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp." Redpath became
      editor of <em>The North American Review</em> in November 1886. See
      also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins, 1926);

         Making of Nineteenth-Century America</em> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University
      Press, 2008); and J.R. LeMaster, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_46.html">Redpath, James [1833–1891]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00722_n1">1. Whitman sent the article
      to Redpath, of <em>The North American Review</em>, on June 29
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.), and it
      evidently appeared in the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> and other
      newspapers associated with Charles Allen Thorndike Rice's syndicate on July 11.
      He received $80 from Rice on July 10 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). This article,
      with "A Backward Glance on My Own Road," "How Leaves of Grass Was Made," and "My
      Book and I" became "A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads" in <em>November Boughs</em> (1888), 5–18.<a href="#r1">[back]
