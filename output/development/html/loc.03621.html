      <br></br><br></br>Dear Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This day I have obtained a P.O. order for £4.12. payable to you.<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r1">1</a></sup> The order (as you are aware) does not pass thro' my own hands.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Of the £4.12, half is the money of Mr. Cozens, to whom you have already sent the books.
      The other half is from a new subscriber, Jas. Anderson Rose,<sup><a href="#n0916" id="r2">2</a></sup> 11 Salisbury St., London, W.C.—He is a solicitor of some note, once Under-Sheriff
      of London, brother of an Alderman
      
      
      
      who has been Lord Mayor; is besides a great collector of engravings &amp; other works
      of artistic (or literary) interest. He does not <u>know</u> your writings, but seems sincerely desirous of making some acquaintance with them.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Wd. you kindly tell Mrs. Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r3">3</a></sup> that I have by me a letter of hers (undated) wh. was presented to me a month or so ago by a Mr. Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r4">4</a></sup>—who paid two long visits at my house, &amp; whom I liked much, obtaining from him numerous
      details that interested me extremely regarding yourself &amp; the Gilchrists. I wd
      
      
      
      have written to Mrs. G before now, but for incessant occupations, &amp; in the last 2
      mos. much anxiety regarding my brother's state of health. He was lately in a bad way,
      requiring a severe surgical operation; &amp;, tho that went off rightly, he does not rally adequately, &amp; I feel by no means confident
      as to the final result. One great object has been to get him out of town to some suitable
      seaside house: I am in hopes that today this will be accomplished, more or less well.
      Please also tell Mrs. G that a son was born to me on 28 Feb: he &amp; the little girl
      (tho the boy did at one time alarm us much) go on well, &amp; are
      
      
      
      at present with their mamma at Gorleston near Yarmouth.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With all affection to you &amp; the Gilchrist family,
      <br></br>Ever truly yours,
      <br></br>Wm. Rossetti.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shd have said that the £4.12. was the <u>only</u> money now actually in my hands on your account. Have not heard from Dowden<sup><a href="#n0199" id="r5">5</a></sup> since I wrote you last.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Excuse this hurried &amp; scrappy note.</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0522">1. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0916">2. James Anderson Rose
      (1819–1890) was a solicitor and collector. William Michael Rosetti wrote
      to Lucy Rossetti on February 26, 1886: "Rose talked to me a goodish deal about
      his books. It seems he has a library of some 10,000 volumes, and has just had
      them catalogued at a cost of £100 or so...Rose says he is solicitor to the
      <em>Globe</em> and <em>Morning Post</em>, as
      well as the <em>Standard</em> (of which last I knew), and has even
      had something to do for the <em>Daily News</em> lately: he must I
      think have well-filled pockets" (James Perrin Warren, <em>Walt
         Whitman's Language Experiment</em>, [College Station, PA: Penn State Press,
      1990], 130 n4).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0259">3. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0141b">4. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0199">5. Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>).

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
