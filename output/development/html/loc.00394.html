      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all much worried at not hearing anything from you. I have been over to the
      headquarters of the 51st three or four times but could get no information about brother
      George. The Times of day before yesterday gave his name among the wounded thus &nbsp;"Lieut
      Whitman Co. E 51st N. Y. V. cheek" and we are trying to comfort ourselves with hope
      that it may not be a serious hurt. We certainly expected to hear from you before this
      and that you had found him. I <em>know</em> you will spare neither pains nor anything else to find him. I do hope that dear brother
      George is not seriously hurt. Dont fail to let us hear from you at once, even if you have not been able to learn anything
      about him &nbsp;it would be a consolation to know certainly that you had arrived safely
      at Washington &nbsp;Mother stands it pretty well, but begins to feel pretty bad about not
      hearing from you
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mat and Dolly<sup><a href="#loc.00394_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> are quite well. We have been picturing to ourselves that you would bring George home
      with you and how nicely we would establish him in our front room with Mat as chief
      nurse. Dear brother do write immediately. Tell George how much we all love him and
      how badly we all feel that he should be hurt.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00394_n100">1. Almost exactly a year
      after Jeff's last letter the Civil War began. George Whitman responded by
      joining the Union army, in which he served until the end of the war. The
      family's fears and anxieties for George were the dominant theme in Jeff and
      Walt's correspondence for these years, and were a chief reason for the intense
      correspondence between the brothers in 1863; in this year more than one-third of
      Jeff's extant letters were written. Walt's general correspondence also
      increased: seventy-five letters from 1863 survive compared to only nineteen from
      the preceding seven years.The immediate cause for family concern was the
      appearance of George's name in a list of wounded from the Battle of
      Fredericksburg (December 13, 1862). The poet set out on December 16, 1862,
      for Washington to search the hospitals for his brother. After finding
      George, who had sustained a superficial cheek wound, Walt decided to stay in
      the capital to help with the war effort by rendering aid in the city's
      numerous military hospitals. On January 1, 1863, Jeff wrote the poet and
      offered financial support, thus making Walt's hospital work a feasible
      project. Jeff began collecting money from his fellow engineers and sending
      it to Walt, who relied heavily on this source of funds. The engineers
      probably supported the hospital work because they were personal friends of
      the Whitman brothers and because their interest in engineering projects of a
      national scope (such as the transcontinental railroad) promoted belief in a
      strong federal government.<a href="#r1">[back]
