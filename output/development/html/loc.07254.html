   <p>I have the "November Boughs"<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r2">2</a></sup> today with my name and yours on fly leaf. I lay this book
      by as one of my most precious possessions. I like the way it is got up and every
      thing about it and consider it altogether one of the most charming books I know. I
      shall keep it by me &amp; look it through often (though I know about every line of
      it already). I note the two corrections (p. 37—An Evening Lull) and think the
      poem should have been left <u>as it was</u>. Last evening I went
      to Sarnia to see Pardee<sup><a href="#n4274" id="r3">3</a></sup> (back by noon today) he is much worse.
      Can speak only a few words and has difficulty in swallowing—I fear he cannot
      live many weeks.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your note (6 Oct)<sup><a href="#loc.07254_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> reached me last evening just before starting to Sarnia. When does
      McKay<sup><a href="#n4983" id="r5">5</a></sup> begin  selling "N.B." I should be anxious to 
      here
      
       how the book goes. If this book does not go I shall think (as my father
      used to say) that "the devil is in it" for sure. Still occupied with
      Inspector—Annual Report shoved aside—but he goes tomorrow, thank the
      Lord. Then I get at A.R. and soon wind it up. Wm Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r6">6</a></sup> has seen
      that man in Detroit—he is greatly taken with the meter. Wants to take it up
      &amp; manufacture but says it is no use thinking of manufacturing for the U.S. in
      <u>one</u> factory however large

   <p>I have been half the afternoon trying to add moments to scribble this
      letter—people running in &amp; out—&amp;c &amp;c

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus

   <p id="n4274">3. Timothy Blair Pardee
      (1830–1889) was a Canadian lawyer and politician, member of the
      Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontaria, Canada, and Minister of the
      Crown. Pardee appointed Richard Maurice Bucke, with whom he was a close friend,
      as the Superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane in Hamilton at its founding
      in 1876, and then the next year as Superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane
      in London. For more on Pardee, see H. V. Nelles, "Pardee, Timothy Blair," <em>Dictionary of Canadian Biography</em> Vol. 11 (Toronto:

   <p id="n4983">5. David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n4284">6. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
