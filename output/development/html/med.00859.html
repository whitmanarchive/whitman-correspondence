   <p>I have no objection to this going in Miss Gould's little book<sup><a href="#med.00859_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—no objection at
      all, but no vehement desire either—If you can include it conveniently, do so;
      if not, not—I am feeling easier and freer the last four days.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00859_n1">1. David McKay published
      Elizabeth Porter Gould's <em>Gems from Walt Whitman</em> in 1889.
      To Traubel the poet observed: "These gems, extracts, specimens, tid-bits,
      brilliants, sparkles, chippings—oh, they are all wearisome: they might go
      with some books: yes, they fit with some books—some books fit with them:
      but Leaves of Grass is different—yields nothing to the seeker for
      sensations" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.57.html">Thursday, December 27, 1888</a>). See also <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.58.html">Friday, December 28, 1888</a>.<a href="#r1">[back]
