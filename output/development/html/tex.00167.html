      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was very glad to hear of the receipt of the check I sent
      you &amp; to know that it had already begun to do some good. I like very much your plan
      of aiding chiefly those frequent cases of suffering among the poor &amp; unfriended
      young men of whom I have myself seen so many in the hospitals—I am sure you must
      be doing infinite good to the bodies &amp; souls of these poor youths so far away from
      all other sympathies &amp; friendships, &amp; who now just seek a friend &amp; comforter
      as few are to them. The hospitals are too cold—too regardless of human
      feeling,—treating our brave volunteers too much like more professional fighters
      not mere like thinking &amp; suffering men.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is bad policy, as well as inhumanity, to treat them so. The effects of the iron
      will
      of our hospitals is discouraging to the hearts of our men, &amp; I fear it does more to
      prevent volunteer enlistments than all other causes—The difficulty of getting
      discharges &amp; furloughs, even in cases clearly demanding such indulgence, is very
      great &amp; seems to increase rather than to diminish—I wish some more humane
      rules could be established. I have tried to prevail upon those in authority to
      ameliorate the system, but without effect—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have received twenty dollars here to be forwarded to you, ($10 cash from my friends
      Henry Lewis of Boston, &amp; Benj. H Silsbee<sup><a href="#tex.00167_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> of Salem,) but
      I retain it for a few days hoping to add more to it—Meanwhile I have sent your letter
      to our friend
      Miss Hannah E. Stevenson<sup><a href="#tex.00167_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>, (whom you may remember as an
      ardent worker in one of the Georgetown Hospitals,) who will read it to some of her
      friends. She informs me that her sister Mrs. Chs P. Curtis has written to you &amp; sent
      aid for the boys. She was much interested in your account of them.
   </p>
   
   <p>It will give me great pleasure to hear from you again—</p>
