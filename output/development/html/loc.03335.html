      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been in London this fortnight &amp; more now, &amp; have completely settled at
      last in this quiet, old-fashioned little street behind Westminster Abbey. From Wales
      I went to Somersetshire—to King Arthur's Vale of Avallon, for a week; then to
      Liverpool, to lecture on "The Modern Novel,"—on the whole I think the best
      lecture I have given yet. The practice I had in America, &amp; the vocal exercises
      that I used to indulge in during my mountain rambles in Wales this fall, seemed to
      have given me greater power &amp; ease of locution. &amp;c. Ten days ago another
      chance to lecture cropped up unexpectedly, in the place of a sick man, before a
      large audience of working men,—chiefly socialists; so I gave them as good an
      account of <u>Leaves of Grass</u> in connection with my visits to
      you &amp; to America generally as I could at an hour or two's notice. To my great
      delight, there proved to be several men there who knew L. of G. &amp; who were able
      to join with good effect in the discussion afterwards. Again last night I was asked
      to go to a society's meeting where a paper on <u>L. of G.</u>
      would be read, by William Clarke,<sup><a href="#loc.03335_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> a young lecturer &amp; journalist, &amp;
      a very able paper it proved to be. During its delivery who should come in but Mrs.
      Costelloe,<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> with Evelyn Nordhoff,<sup><a href="#loc.03335_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; after the paper, Mrs. C. joined in the discussion, speaking with wonderful
      ease &amp; grace, &amp; in fact rather casting into the shade the efforts of the
      rest of us. Shortly
      afterwards, Mrs. C &amp; Miss N. had to go, &amp; I saw them into a hansom, not
      expecting of course to see them again; but when an hour later or so I was sauntering
      home, red glare in the sky in the direction of Grosvenor Road, but on the opposite
      side of the river, &amp; the sound of fire-bells &amp; galloping horses in the
      distance, drew me out of my way. On reaching Lambeth Bridge, I found Doulton's great
      pottery had caught fire in one of its buildings &amp; was making a fine blaze, right
      opposite Costelloe's; &amp; I went along then, expecting to find some of them on the
      balcony watching the spectacle. They had not seen it however, &amp; were glad to
      come out to Lambeth Bridge where we stood till the fire was got under. The effect
      of
      the red glare on the water, with the black barges shooting by, &amp; the river
      fire-engine's steaming up, was singularly striking, especially in contrast with the
      pale, cold moon which shone on the other side. Altogether a wonderful scene!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>After being so long in the quiet of the mountains, you can imagine how these
      excitements of town affect one. Here in Westminster, I am in a capital situation for
      making the most of what London can give one of a healthy &amp; helpful kind. Charing
      Cross is only a short walk distant, with the Strand &amp; its theatres &amp; crowded
      pavements. The river is almost at the back-door, or at any rate only a short street
      away; so that I have the ferries close at hand, &amp; trains &amp; busses are
      equally handy. My American trip seems to have given me a new energy of assimilation
      too. Never before were all the sights &amp; sounds of London so full of suggestion;
      I think you must have unwittingly given me some of your power of co-ordinating
      imaginatively the everyday experiences of the crowd &amp; the life of the streets.
      (By the way, have you seen 'The Century' for Decr.? There's a vivid account of
      London by Hy. James,<sup><a href="#n2001" id="r4">4</a></sup> with clever sketches by Jo. Pennell,<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> which gives a very true impression of the whole thing.) And
      now I must stop for to-day, for I have a great deal of work to get through. Don't
      forget about the promised <u>Novr. Boughs</u><sup><a href="#n3999" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; the collected
      complete works,<sup><a href="#n4188" id="r7">7</a></sup> which I want to review immediately! 
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      with much love, 
      <br></br>Ernest Rhys
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I
      hear<sup><a href="#loc.03335_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup> great account of Gilchrist as Art professor! Tell him the Hobby-Horsemen
      are so much struck by his success, that they think of following him en-masse to
      Philadelphia.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03335_n1">1. William Clarke
      (1852–1901) was a British socialist and journalist. After Whitman's death,
      he published an "appreciation" of the poet (<em>Walt Whitman</em>,
      London: Sonnenschein, 1892).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02189_n1">2. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03335_n2">3. Evelyn Hunter Nordhoff
      (1865–1898) was the first female bookbinder in the US. She had learned her
      trade in London and became aquainted with Costelloe there.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2001">4. Henry James (1843–1916) was
      an American-born writer and the author of such notable works as <em>Daisy Miller</em> (1879), <em>The Portrait of a
         Lady</em> (1881), <em>The Bostonians</em> (1886), and <em>The Ambassadors</em> (1903). James spent most of his adult
      life in Europe, becoming a British subject in 1915.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02189_n2">5. Joseph Pennell
      (1857–1926) was an American author and etcher. He and his wife Elizabeth
      Robins were friends of Whitman in Camden.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">6. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4188">7. Whitman often referred to <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888) as his "big book." With
      the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made the presswork and binding decisions,
      and Frederick Oldach bound the volume, which included a profile photo of the
      poet on the title page. Philadelphia publisher David McKay published the book in
      December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
