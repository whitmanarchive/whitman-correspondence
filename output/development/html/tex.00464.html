      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>During the past day or two I have been arranging your portraits for the 'Scottish
      Art
      Review' (where they will probably appear in the May number), and at the same time
      I
      have been reading <u>November Boughs</u><sup><a href="#n3999" id="r1">1</a></sup> with great
      delight—Mrs. Costelloe's<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> copy of the book! There
      is a double stimulus in your poems &amp; prose writings, now that I am able to read
      between the lines, feeling all the time as if I can still see you in your great
      arm-chair—as during my visits a year ago,—a never failing friendly
      presence behind the black-&amp;-white of the printed page. It is this impression that
      I
      must try to convey as far as may be in my article in the S. A. Review accompanying
      the portraits. —I wonder by the way whether Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      would allow me to reproduce the photo. from his painting at the same time. Perhaps
      you will say a word to him about this?
   </p> 
   
   <p>Since coming back to London from my pleasant jaunt in South Wales—when I had a
      capital time of it in exploring Worm's Head &amp; the Gower coast,— I have been grinding
      away pretty hard at mere literary work—more than I like indeed, for I want to
      be less &amp; less literary in the narrow sense henceforth, &amp; go in for expressing life
      direct rather than dealing with other people's books. This is a lesson of course
      that <u>L. of Grass</u> teach me. So my instinct for life &amp; the
      open road grows stronger every day. "Right Jack Health!" as Keats said,<sup><a href="#tex.00464_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Health
      before everything!
   </p>
   
   <p>Living in London need not mean any excess of mere <u>literariness</u>, however. There's no such place for Life after all. Even New
      York has not such tumult—such human interplay &amp; variety. Everyday something
      new &amp; inspiring discovers itself in the familiar ways. This struck me in walking
      along the Embankment from Westminster to Waterloo Bridges this afternoon with the
      tide—higher than usual—just at the full; the river alive with various
      craft. The sight would have pleased you well.
   </p>
   
   <p>I believe I told you that my sister Edith<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r5">5</a></sup> was with me here. She is going in for
      music, &amp; at this moment is thundering away at Wagner's 'Flying Dutchman' on the
      piano. We called on Mrs. Costelloe the other day, &amp; found her very well. Edith quite
      fell in love with her.
   </p>
   
   <p>Getting dusk as I finish this just in time for post. Hope you are feeling better
      every way. Edith sends her love. Mine goes without saying. Remember me to all good
      friends.
   </p>

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">2. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
