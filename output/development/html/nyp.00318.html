      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you got my letter Monday 12th (written Sunday.) I am still improving—
      (I don't feel quite as well to-day as for some days past—
      but it is a great advance on what I have been)—&amp; am in good spirits—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear mother, I feel very anxious about you<sup><a href="#nyp.00318_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—it is very distressing to have the nervous system affected, 
      it always makes one feel so discouraged, that is the worst of it—Mother, 
      I am afraid you are more unwell than you say—I think about it night &amp; day—
      the enclosed letter came to me yesterday—Jeff sent it to me, by mistake 
      (may-be one for me has gone to you)—I got another letter from Jeff to-day<sup><a href="#nyp.00318_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—all are well—Jeff too is anxious about you—
      Mother, try to write a line soon after you get this—I am writing 
      this in the office—Mother, I shall come on—
      
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00318_n1">1. About May 12, 1873,
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman explained that her "nervous system is very much out of
      order . . . my head feels bad . . . i have such trembling spels" (Trent
      Collection, Duke University). She thought that she would improve if she got away
      from Camden. Louisa, unknown to her mother-in-law, also wrote to Walt Whitman
      about the same time (The Library of Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00318_n2">2. Writing on , Jeff was concerned about the situation
      in Camden, Louisa's stinginess, George's failure "to make things good and happy"
      for his mother, and the possibility of having her go to Washington (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
