   <p>(<u>Private</u>) when a great general dies, you print his obituary, &amp; his record, by its inspiration
      sometimes does as much good as his deeds.â€”I think the 51st New York Veterans, lately
      captured almost entire, while bravely fighting, deserves some such mention. The statements
      in the abstract I send are all facts. You will see I have avoided any thing like puffing,
      but given an abstract only.<sup><a href="#duk.00386_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup>

   <p id="duk.00386_n100">1. This letter is a
      draft and apparently a letter of transmittal for Whitman's "Fifty-First New York
      City Veterans," published in the <em>New York Times</em>, October
      29, 1864. It is written on the back of a series of notes by Whitman that have
      been crossed out.<a href="#r1">[back]
