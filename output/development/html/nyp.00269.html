      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As you see by the date, &amp;c. I am home, on a visit to my mother &amp; the rest.
      Mother is about as well as usual—has occasionally some trouble with
      rheumatism, but is cheerful &amp; keeps up amazingly. We speak of you every day,
      &amp; I have to give minute particulars of you, William, little Jenny, &amp; all. My
      brother George is very well, looks hearty &amp; brown as ever—much like he
      used to, only more serious—Jeff is at St. Louis, on the Water Works. Martha
      &amp; the little girls are well—they are here in Brooklyn, occupying temporary
      apartments. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am well as usual, &amp; go daily around New York &amp; Brooklyn yet with interest,
      of course—but I find the places &amp; crowds &amp; excitements—Broadway,
      &amp;c—have not the zest of former times—they have done their work,
      &amp; now they are to me as a tale that is told—Only the majestic &amp; moving
      river &amp; rapid sea-water scenery &amp; life about the islands, N. Y. and
      Brooklyn, tower into larger proportions than ever. I doubt if the world elsewhere
      has their equal, or could have, to me—The waters about New York &amp; west end
      of Long-Island are real sea-waters, &amp; are ever-rolling &amp; rushing in or
      out—never placid, never calm—surely they please this uneasy spirit, Me,
      that ebbs &amp; flows too all the while, yet gets nowhere, &amp; amounts to
      nothing—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am trying to write a piece, to be called <em>Democracy</em>, for the
      leading article in the December or January number of the <em>Galaxy</em>—in some sort a counterblast or rejoinder to Carlyle's late
      piece, <em>Shooting Niagara</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00269_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup>, which you must have read, or at least
      heard about. Mr. Church<sup><a href="#nyp.00269_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup> strongly wishes it written. Mother &amp; Martha send love, &amp; I also,
      most truly—I shall probably return to Washington last of the week.
   </p>

   <p id="nyp.00269_n5">3. William Conant Church
      (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
      York newspapers until he founded the <em>Army and Navy
         Journal</em> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
      he established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. Financial control of
      the <em>Galaxy</em> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
      was absorbed by the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1878. William
      published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
      Francis wrote for the New York <em>Sun</em> the unsigned piece
      "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." See Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the
