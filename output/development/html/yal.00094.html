   </p>
   
   <p>I rec'd the letters this afternoon, two in the envelope with a note from you. I wrote
      to William some five days ago—has he not rec'd it? I had grown worse, quite a good
      deal, &amp; I was about making up my mind that I would have to stand a good seige—but yesterday the current changed, &amp; I felt better all day, &amp; in the afternoon went
      out riding with my brother, the first time I have been out of the house since I got
      home—&amp; to-day I remain feeling better.
   </p>
   
   <p>The doctor to-day tells me my throat is markedly better—In my letter to William I
      told him I had rec'd his—I have also rec'd one from Nelly—it was very welcome, &amp; I
      shall try to answer it soon—When you write tell me the impressions you got in the
      army, &amp; the probabilities as far as you can make them out—As to me, I still believe
      in Grant, &amp; that we shall get Richmond—we have heard from my brother to July 2<sup><a href="#yal.00094_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—tell me about Ashton<sup><a href="#yal.00094_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—in a day or two as I get strength I shall probably go down the island—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

   <p id="yal.00094_n1">1. On , George wrote from "near Petersburg
      instead of from Richmond." Whitman here echoed George's optimism: "We all
      believe in Grant, and as far as I can hear the opinion is universal in the army,
      that before the campaign is over Petersburg and Richmond will be in our
      posession."<a href="#r1">[back]
