      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I got the Camden paper this morning containing the notice of your mothers death. I
      had heard through Eldridge a few days ago that all was over with her. I suppose it
      was not unexpected to you yet for all that the blow must have been a heavy one to
      all her children and doubly so to yourself. I should like to hear from you the
      particulars of her last days. I wish I might have seen her again. If you are able
      to
      write  do drop me a
      line &amp; tell me about yourself &amp; what your plans are for the summer. I hope
      you do not think of returning to W. before fall. I go to N. Y. to-morrow for a few
      days. While there a letter addressed to me care of George Bliss Jr. W. S. Atty,
      41 Chambers St. will reach me. If you can come North &amp; spend some time with me I
      should be delighted. I am going out on L. I. to look at a place for sale, Yaphank
      on [
      <span class="unclear">Carmand?</span>]
       Ruin. Do you know the country out there?
   </p>
   
   <p>My nephew, Chancy B. is with me for a few days but leaves to-morrow; so does Sulic
      for Kingston. They both
      speak affectionately of you &amp; are much concerned on your account.
   </p>
   
   <p>The lilacs are in their prime here, but the season is getting dry.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
