      <br></br><br></br>To Messrs: Griffin Martinez Prince, and other gentlemen at Santa
      Fe—
      <br></br>Dear Sirs:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your kind invitation to visit you and deliver a poem for the 333d Anniversary of Founding
      Santa Fe has reached me so late, that I have to
      decline, with sincere regret.<sup><a href="#med.00660_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> But I will say a few words
      off-hand.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We Americans have yet to really learn our own antecedents, and sort them, to unify
      them. They will be found ampler than has been supposed and in widely different
      sources. Thus far, impressed by New England writers and schoolmasters, we
      tacitly abandon ourselves to the notion that our United States have been fashioned
      from the British Islands only, and essentially form a second England
      only—which is a great mistake. Many leading traits for our future national
      personality, and some of the best ones, will certainly prove to have
      originated from other than British stock. As it is, the British and German, valuable
      as they are in the concrete, already threaten excess. Or rather, I should say, they
      have certainly 
      reach'd
      
       that excess. To-day, something outside of them, and to
      counterbalance them, is seriously needed.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thus seething materialistic and business vortices of the United States, in their
      present devouring relations, controlling and belittling everything else, are, in my
      opinion, but a vast and indispensable stage in the new world's development, and are
      certainly to be 
      follow'd
      
       by something entirely different—at least by immense modifications.
      Character, literature, a society worthy the name, are yet to be 
      establish'd, through a nationality of noblest spiritual, heroic and democratic
      attributes—not one of which at present definitely exists—entirely
      different from the past, though unerringly founded on it, and to justify it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To that composite American identity of the future, Spanish character will supply some
      of the most needed parts. No stock shows a grander historic
      retrospect—grander in religiousness and loyalty, or for patriotism,
      courage, decorum, gravity and honor. (It is time to dismiss utterly the
      illusion-compound, half raw-head-and-bloody-bones and
      half Mysteries-of-Udolpho, inherited from the English writers of the
      past 200 years. It is time to realize—for it is certainly true—that
      there will not be found any more cruelty, tryanny, superstition, &amp;c., in the
      résumé of past Spanish history than in the corresponding résumé
      of Anglo-Norman history. Nay, I think there will not be found so
      much.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Then another point, relating to American ethnology, past and to come, I will here
      touch upon at a venture. As to our aboriginal or Indian population—the Aztec
      in the South, and many a tribe in the North and West—I know it seems to be
      agreed that they must gradually dwindle as time rolls on, and in a few
      generations more leave only a reminiscence, a blank. But I am not at all
      clear about that. As America, from its many far-back sources and current
      supplies, develops, adapts, entwines, faithfully identifies its own—are
      we to see it cheerfully accepting and using all the contributions of foreign lands
      from the whole outside globe—and then rejecting the only ones
      distinctively its own—the autochthonic ones?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As to the Spanish stock of our Southwest, it is certain to me that we do not begin
      to
      appreciate the splendor and sterling value of its race element. Who knows but that
      element, like the course of some subterranean river, dipping invisibly for a hundred
      or two years, is now to emerge in broadest flow and permanent action?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If I might assume to do so, I would like to send you the most cordial,
      heart-felt congratulations of your American fellow-countrymen here. You
      have more friends in the Northern and Atlantic regions than you suppose, and they
      are deeply interested in development of the great Southwestern interior, and in what
      your festival would arouse to public attention.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00660_n1">1. This transcript is
      taken from a copy labeled in Whitman's own autograph: "Copy of Letter sent by
      Walt Whitman in response to invitation of 'Tertio. Millenial Anniversary
      Association' at Santa Fe New Mexico." A copy was also sent to the Philadelphia
      <em>Press</em> for publication; the article was run on August
      5, 1883, with the following headnote: "Our friends at Santa Fé, New Mexico,
      have just 
      finish'd
      
       their long drawn out anniversary of the 333d year of the settlement of
      their city by the Spanish. The good, gray Walt Whitman was asked to write them a
      poem in commemoration. Instead he wrote them a letter as follows." The letter
      from Arthur Boyle, requesting a poem for the "Santa Fé Tertio Millennial
      Celebration," is in the Feinberg collection. Whitman's letter appears in <em>November Boughs</em> as "The Spanish Element in Our
      Nationality," (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1888), 50–51.<a href="#r1">[back]
