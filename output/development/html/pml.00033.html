      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing special to write about to-day. The new Attorney General Mr. Williams<sup><a href="#pml.00033_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> has been in once or twice—he is a tallish, western sort of man, wears a stove-pipe
      hat—is rather spare &amp; a little round shouldered—sallow complexion—long legged—seems
      quite plain in his talk—Ashton says he is a good man—we will see—He takes his seat
      about the 10th Jan.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>½ past 10, forenoon</em>—Mama, your letter has just come—It is too bad to have such a puppy as Stanton<sup><a href="#pml.00033_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> annoying you—He is one of the Heyde sort, it always seemed to me—Mother, write to
      me how it turns out—whether they leave or not—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I see you have it very changeable there too—After the severest cold spell ever known
      here so early, 
      we are just now having it mild &amp; warm enough for spring—it rained here this morning,
      but is now bright &amp; pleasant—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose Lou<sup><a href="#pml.00033_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> will be with you now—I should like first rate to just drop in on you all—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I continue to get letters &amp;c from abroad about my book—I believe I told you I got
      one the other day from Denmark, 
      from the editor of the principal magazine there.<sup><a href="#pml.00033_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> He is preparing a review &amp; partial translation of my writings—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mama dear, I hope you will have a pleasant holiday week, what's left of it—Don't let
      Stanton annoy you, the dirty scamp—Love to you, dearest mother, &amp; to George &amp; Lou
      &amp; all.
      
   </p>

      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Write by next Sunday if convenient, &amp; tell me if the order comes safe—</p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, give the enclosed $1 to the letter-carrier, if you think proper—</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pml.00033_n1">1. George Henry Williams
      (1820–1910), U.S. Senator from Oregon, served as Attorney General from
      1871 to 1875. Williams dismissed Walt Whitman on June 30, 1874; Whitman
      "respectfully acknowledged" his dismissal in his  letter to Williams.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="pml.00033_n2">2. 
      The Stantons lived downstairs; according to Walt Whitman's  letter to Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman, George "turned 'em out for impudence to mother."<br><br>
      According to a letter sent in 1928 to Harry Hanson of the New York <em>World</em>, which he in turn transmitted to Emory
      Holloway, Elizabeth Stanton was the daughter of an editorial writer on the
      New York <em>News</em>. Her daughter described Walt Whitman as
      a "rude and rough" man who enjoyed sitting in the Stanton kitchen as he
      recited his poetry.<a href="#r2">[back]
