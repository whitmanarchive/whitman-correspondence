      <br></br><br></br>My dearest friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I did not know at all till supper with my sister-in-law <em>last
         evening</em> that you had had a conversation with her about, &amp; special
      interest in, my pecuniary condition, &amp;c. If I had known it at the time I should
      have spoken about it, &amp; freely, to you, by word of mouth—as that would
      have been, &amp; is, best in such things.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When I came to Camden in '73, paralyzed, I felt, (&amp; the feeling has since been
      confirmed,) that I had retired for good from the active world, but that I might
      linger along for years yet. I bought a pleasant little cheap lot here, paid for it,
      &amp; my plan was to put up a small three or four room house on it, in which I might
      live plainly &amp; comfortably the rest of my days—&amp; that is still my plan
      &amp; desire.<sup><a href="#col.00005_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I had saved up quite a fund from my
      earnings '65 to '72 as clerk in Washington—but they have now become about
      exhausted by expenses of three years, (for I just take board &amp; lodging here
      &amp; pay for them scrupulously same as in some temporary inn.) My great wish still
      is to put up for myself this little three or four room home for the rest of my days,
      independently, in a sort. I suppose it would cost 700 or 800 dollars.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have managed to get out complete my new edition both Vols. which I now begin to
      sell &amp; job myself—intend to continue doing so—(have somehow an idea
      that I should then, in my own shanty, &amp; for time to come, be able to live on the
      moderate steady income of the sales of my own works—<em>which
         is most satisfactory to me</em>)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was in hopes to have seen you again before you sail'd—I was at Mrs Lesley's
      again about three weeks since (to meet Miss Kate Hillard)<sup><a href="#col.00005_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—had a very pleasant afternoon with Mrs.
      L &amp; the rest—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Things go on much the same with me in physical condition—I send you a paper
      &amp; some slips, same mail with this—I have written very lately to W M
      Rossetti about my affairs, books, &amp;c.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Moncure Daniel Conway (1832–1907) was an
      American abolitionist and frequent correspondent with Walt Whitman. Conway often
      acted as Whitman's agent and occasional public relations man in England. For
      more on Conway, see Philip W. Leon, ""<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_182.html">Conway Moncure Daniel (1832–1907)</a>," <em>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="col.00005_n1">1. The year is established
      by the references to the 1876 edition. Perhaps Conway visited Walt Whitman on
      March 18, 1876. According to Whitman's  letter to Ellen O'Connor, Conway was to return to England about
      the middle of March 1876. For the subsequent controversy, see Whitman's  letter to William Michael
      Rossetti.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="col.00005_n2">2. On , Thomas A. Wilson had offered Walt
      Whitman a lot on Royden Street for $450. Whitman wrote of the sale in his  letter to Peter Doyle. Walt Whitman
      did not move into his own "shanty" until 1884.<a href="#r2">[back]
