   <p id="med.00663_n1">2. According to Amy Haslam
      Dowe's "A Child's Memories of the Whitmans," some elderly women identified only
      as "the Chevaliers" lived across the street from Whitman (see Edwin Haviland
      Miller, "Amy H. Dowe and Walt Whitman," <em>The Walt Whitman
         Review</em> 13 [September 1967], 73–79). The Chevaliers may also have
      been relatives of the Camden printer William Chevalier.<a href="#r2">[back]
