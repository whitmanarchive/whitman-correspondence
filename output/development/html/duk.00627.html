   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00627_n1">1. This letter dates to May 1,
      1873. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman began the letter by acknowledging receipt of
      Walt Whitman's letter "this 1 of may." Richard Maurice Bucke inscribed the year
      1873 on the letter surface, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date
      (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:217, n. 74; 2:370). The year 1873 is
      consistent with Louisa's living in Camden, New Jersey, with Walt's payment for
      Edward Whitman's board, and with Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and daughters
      boarding with the Bulkley family after the February 1873 death of Jeff's wife
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00627_n2">2. See Walt Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      Walt enclosed $15 and promised to send $5 more in his next letter. Walt paid
      George Washington Whitman and his wife Louisa Orr "Lou" Haslam Whitman $20 per
      month for his brother Edward Whitman's board.<a href="#r2">[back]

      1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00627_n4">4. See Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman's  letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson
         Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984],
      166–169).<br><br>
      Jeff Whitman (1833–1890) was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood
      he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began
      working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through
      the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman had shared a home with Jeff and his wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman for several years before their departure to St. Louis. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00627_n5">5. After Mattie Whitman's death
      in February 1873, Jeff Whitman and daughters Manahatta and Jessie Louisa began
      boarding at the home of Mary Moody and Philemon C. Bulkley. The remarks that
      follow—on Jeff's Kansas work, on boarding with the Bulkley's, and on Mr.
      Bulkley's potential visit to New York and to Washington to fetch Walt Whitman to
      St. Louis—are paraphrased from Jeff's letter. See Jeff's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt:
         The Letters of Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State
      University Press, 1984], 167).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="duk.00627_n15">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      acknowledged receipt of Walt Whitman's letter, which is not extant, in his  letter to Walt.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">7. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00627_n7">8. The Boston work is for
      Joseph Phineas Davis (1837–1917), who was the city engineer there from
      1871 to 1880. Davis had worked with Jeff Whitman in Brooklyn, had joined Jeff in
      St. Louis, and had served a brief stint in Lowell, Massachusetts
      (1870–1871), before becoming the city engineer of Boston. Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman was also quite friendly with Davis, who had shared the Pacific
      Street home before Jeff's departure in 1867 and had stopped by her house in
      Brooklyn when working in Lowell (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman). Davis completed his career at American
      Telephone and Telegraph Company (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see
      Francis P. Stearns and Edward W. Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917),
      437–442.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00627_n8">9. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. He later
      designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city
      engineer. George Washington Whitman's original connection to Lane was through
      his brother Jeff Whitman: "jeff says as long as lane is in the [Brooklyn] water
      works georgey will be" (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). Lane resigned as Chief
      Engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works in 1869, and he soon became City Engineer
      of Milwaukee ("Moses Lane," <em>Proceedings of the American
         Society of Civil Engineers</em> [February 1882], 58). Like Joseph P. Davis
      (above), Lane was loyal to George as a pipe inspector. The employment
      opportunity for George in Milwaukee that Walt mentioned in his  letter to Louisa was
      probably with Lane.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00627_n13">10. George Washington Whitman
      in March 1873 made at least two trips to Brooklyn to seek work inspecting pipe
      with a commissioner named Henry Adams, who is listed in a public call to
      property owners on the altering of water lines on Lee Avenue ("Notice," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, December 5, 1872, 1). See Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt
      Whitman.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00627_n14">11. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      had reported that George Washington Whitman in early 1873 was inspecting pipe
      for Moses Lane at the R. D. Wood Foundry sites in Camden and Florence, New
      Jersey, and at the Gloucester Iron-Works (see her  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n6">12. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00627_n10">13. Walt Whitman had enclosed a
      copy of the March 15, 1873 <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_title/per.00107.html"><em>New York Daily Graphic</em></a>, which featured his
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00129.html">"The Singing Thrush"</a>, in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. The tabloid newspaper was
      published from 1873 to 1889, and Louisa in her  letter to Walt had remarked, "i like them very much i should
      think they would be a sucsess [<em>sic</em>]."<a href="#r13">[back]
