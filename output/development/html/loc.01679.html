   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01679_n1">1. This postcard is
      addressed: Pete Doyle, | M st. South—bet 4½ &amp; 6th | Washington, D. C.
      It is postmarked: Camden | Sep | 10 | N.J. The postcard cannot be assigned to a
      specific year for obvious reasons: the allusions to his health are vague and are
      in fact applicable to almost any time between 1873 and 1876; there are no
      concrete references to events which would make dating possible. However, it was
      written on a standard government postcard which was redesigned in 1876.<a href="#r1">[back]
