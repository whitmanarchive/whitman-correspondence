   <p id="loc.00786_n2">2. As Whitman informed Mrs.
      Curtis in a letter from 
      , Caleb Babbitt
      suffered a sun stroke in July 1863 and was admitted to Armory Square Hospital.
      According to the "Hospital Note Book" (Henry E. Huntington Library), Babbitt had
      been in Mobile earlier. About August 1, 1863, he left Washington on furlough. On
      August 18, 1863, Mary A. Babbitt informed Whitman of Caleb's arrival in Barre,
      Massachusetts; because of his exhaustion he was unable to write. Mary
      acknowledged Whitman's letter on September 6, 1863, and wrote that Caleb was
      "not quite as well as when I wrote you before . . . he wishes me to tell you to
      keep writing . . . for your letters do him more good than a great deal of
      medicine." On September 18, 1863, at the expiration of his forty-day furlough,
      Caleb was strong enough to write: "Walt—In your letters you wish me to imagine
      you talking with me when I read them, well I do, and it does very well to think
      about, but it is nothing compared with the original." On October 1, 1863,
      Babbitt was depressed—"dark clouds seem to be lying in my pathway and I can not
      remove them nor hide them from my mind"—until he mentioned his beloved, Nellie
      F. Clark, who "has saved me." On October 26, 1863, S. H. Childs wrote for Caleb
      from the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston: "He Is unable to set up &amp;
      suffers considerable pain In his head" (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection,
      New York Public Library). See also Whitman's letters from 
      , and

      two pieces, on the verso of which appears the draft letter to Bethuel Smith from
