      <br></br><br></br>Dear Ed
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Y'rs came this morning &amp; welcome—Nothing very different here—much the
      same with me in health &amp;c:—am feeling at the best I am capable of these
      times (&amp; that is poor enough)—had a fresh egg &amp; nice biscuit &amp;
      coffee for my breakfast—sleep fairly yet—Warren<sup><a href="#loc.00668_n4" id="r1">1</a></sup> is still with me &amp; is very kind &amp;
      good—gives me first rate massages, (twice a day)—Harry<sup><a href="#duk.00936_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> is quite unwell—the stomach seems to have given
      out, obstinately &amp; badly, &amp; there are other bad features—but H is
      young, good-spirited &amp; the spring of year is at hand—all favorable points
      to threaten'd or incipient sickness—Mrs: D[avis]<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r3">3</a></sup> is well
      &amp; smiling as usual—all send love &amp; best remembrance to you—as I
      do too—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send the Camden "Morning News" of this mn'g wh' has a piece ab't me<sup><a href="#duk.00936_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—the English register'd envelope, tho' common
      enough, will be one of the curios for y'r stamp collection—Ed, the little
      dinner b'k<sup><a href="#duk.00936_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> is a present to you, &amp; is <em>not</em> to be paid for—Do you remember Harry Stafford<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r6">6</a></sup>—He is quite sick—has fits of being out of his
      mind—his wife<sup><a href="#n6107" id="r7">7</a></sup> has a new baby boy<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r8">8</a></sup>—Mrs: Somers's husband<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r9">9</a></sup> is dead &amp; buried—a
      young RR friend Elwood Mills<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r10">10</a></sup> (consumption) was buried a few
      days ago, Warren's friend—you remember Florence<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r11">11</a></sup> over in
      Phila? She has a fine little red-headed baby boy—So the contrast—birth
      &amp; life—just here I receive a beautiful bunch of great white lilies, sent
      me f'm Bermuda—Ed, when a fellow learns he knows little or nothing in reality,
      the old Socratic rule was, <em>he was beginning to learn the very
         best</em>—God bless you, boy—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00668_n4">1. Frederick Warren Fritzinger
      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,
      535).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0590">6. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
