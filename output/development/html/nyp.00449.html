   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James S. Stilwell, Second
      New York Cavalry, was confined in Ward C of Armory Square with a gunshot wound
      in his left leg; see "Notebook: Septemberâ€“October, 1863" (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection) and "Hospital Notes" (Henry E. Huntington Library). He
      recovered slowly from his injury. About the end of May in the following year he
      was sent to Mower Hospital, Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania, where he remained until
      he was granted a furlough in August 1864. He later returned to Mower Hospital
      and wrote to Whitman on , that
      his wound was "most healed up," and that he expected either to be discharged or
      to be transferred to New York. See also Stilwell's letter to Whitman from . He was the brother of Julia and
      John Stilwell.
