      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman:—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your beautiful gift<sup><a href="#med.00869_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> rec'd<sup><a href="#loc.03051_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> the pocket book ed. L of G.<sup><a href="#med.00869_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I gloated and gloated over it.
      Such a precious memento! How we ought to love each other, &amp; draw closer &amp;
      closer in manly friendship—all of us who think &amp; believe the same things
      of the universe &amp; man. There is a mystery back of the visible, I am confident
      All matter seems to me instint w. latent consciousness. Those Platonic remembrances
      the dim pre-natal consciousness carried over thro' the seminal germ of
      foetus—very remarkable psychological fact—only showing the <u>delicate</u> character of matter.
   </p>
   
   <p>Thank you very much for the valuable &amp; remarkably vigorous little <u>Ilias-in-nuce</u> sketch of Whittier.<sup><a href="#n1029" id="r4">4</a></sup><sup><a href="#loc.03051_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> It is worth all of my book put together. You make me
      jealous—you man of great power—you write home with such resistless power, &amp;
      graphic=picturesque words. I am going to quote what you say of Whittier. It's all
      right just what you w<u>d</u> say in print.<sup><a href="#loc.03051_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I am having a grand visit from a cousin. A real Western woman.<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r7">7</a></sup>—A Woodruff (you
      may have known one kinsman (cousin) Judge Lewis B. Woodruff<sup><a href="#loc.03051_n6" id="r8">8</a></sup> of New York
      Circuit-Court, highly revered man for his probity &amp; his legal decisions). This
      Hattie
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Woodruff McDowell, fr' the Western Reserve is one of those marvellous, energetic
      Western girls—wrapped in their purity as armor, who go out &amp; locate land,
      farm their own living, &amp; travel alone around the continent,—&amp; lose no
      feminine charm. The world can't beat it!
   </p>
   
   <p>She brought in her trunk some calamus root which she boiled in maple sugar up in
      Vermont on a sugar ranche of her mother=in=law. I send you a little snip dear dad.
      Prost! I also send you per express paid a couple of jars of my nice currant jam put
      up by myself fr fruit raised by me here.
   </p>
   
   <p>Sorry indeed to hear of increase of that little deafness, &amp; of yr eyes. Keep a
      grand heart
   </p>
   
   <p>Hattie brings me a long letter of Jesse R. Grant, the General's father, addressed
      to
      my great uncle Granger, (Judge William G. of Ohio<sup><a href="#loc.03051_n5" id="r9">9</a></sup> very wealthy now deceased). Jesse
      came very near marrying my uncle's sister he says. I may publish the letter. <u>So keep mum</u>. Curious to think what wd hv. been the fate of
      the U.S. if he <u>had</u> married Eliza G.<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r10">10</a></sup>!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n1029">4. John Greenleaf Whittier
      (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
      slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
      surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
      Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
      volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (various publishers: 1906–1996) and Whitman's "My Tribute to Four Poets,"
      in <em>Specimen Days</em> (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh &amp; Co.,
