      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been in all day—I don't think I ever knew such long continued gales of wind—this
      is now the fourth or fifth day—night &amp; day—&amp; as I write it is howling 
      &amp; whirling just as bad as ever—I havn't been out any to speak of for three days—the gales are too much for me. My spell of
      let up &amp; feeling somewhat more comfortable continues, 
      with some interruptions—night before last, &amp; for some time yesterday I was in a bad
      way again—but had a good night's rest last night, &amp; am comfortable to-day—I think
      I am decidedly more improving, than going behindhand—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have thought frequently of Parker Milburn—all his ways, &amp; his good points, come
      up in my mind—&amp; now the news comes of the sudden death of Mr. Sumner<sup><a href="#loc.01644_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Your letter came Monday, &amp; the <u>Herald</u>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p> <u>Friday, March 13—12 M</u>
      
      
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Not very well to-day—To add to my troubles, a very bad cold in the head &amp; all over
      me, 
      again—this is the third attack this winter—but enough of grunting—The papers are filled
      with Sumner's death, funeral, life, &amp;c. The cold, dry gale continues here. 
      I get letters from Mrs O'Connor. Don't fail to go up &amp; make her a call, when convenient.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You remember Arnold Johnson<sup><a href="#loc.01644_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> that used to live over on the hill by the Insane Asylum—well he has come back to
      Washington, &amp; is Chief Clerk again Light House Board, 
      &amp; Wm O'Connor has changed to a clerkship in the Library, Treasury.<sup><a href="#loc.01644_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I am sitting here alone in the same old seat in the parlor writing.
      
   </p>

      Good bye for this time dear boy—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
