      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p><u>Now</u>, the "situation" is as follows. I had by far [illegible] or larger <u>wheat crop</u> than [illegible] before—a [
      <span class="unclear">little?</span>]
       [illegible] of <u>good oats</u>—the little [illegible] <u>cotton</u>, on [illegible] (most of it) than I usually plant, [
      <span class="unclear">proving?</span>]
       tolerably well—"rust" beginning now (rust [illegible] ate). On all poor lands about me, <u>cotton</u> started off very slowly, but since the end of an <u>unprecedented</u> drouth lasting through May, the "season" [illegible] been, right about me, <u>absolute</u> <u>perfection</u> and the cotton <u>couldn't help</u> climbing and climbing till it has got to a pretty respectable size. Then as to my
      <u>corn</u>, planted on very much "spotted" ground, upon taking a "first-day loaf" with a neighbor,
      a week ago, I felt bound to say this corn with nearly every stalk bearing either a
      big ear or a good-sized "nubbin" <u>speaks volumes for the season</u>—Maybe it would have done you good to be there and hear how the Philosopher can "swagger"
      and <u>descant</u> and <u>crow</u> on fitting occasions. (However, it may be you are destined as [illegible] mode of <u>punishments for your "sins"</u>, never to enjoy "true Free Will" by getting to enjoy [illegible] and be with <u>the</u> P—rather than take <u>second choice</u> and suffer banishment in outer darkness.) The land being mostly poor, I am surprised
      at the crop—I never have made a crop with so little of plowing after planting. Indeed
      [illegible] for 3 years past have helped as to make cultivation easy, I have had fine [illegible] to practise [illegible] only sin of <u>resting too much</u>.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I think I had better stop my [illegible] off the [illegible] you some facts of my spiritual or "religious" experience. <u>Then</u>—[illegible] thou this, I [illegible] not "taken in hand" and "indoctrinated" with ideas about "God" &amp;c. [illegible] so early as most children. I remember well, I was beginning to <u>walk two miles</u> to <u>school</u> before the first person (the <u>schoolmaster</u>) put into my head the thought that the "world" was either <u>made</u> or <u>needed</u> to be made. I had accepted naturally, "<u>normally</u>", the self-existence and eternity of <u>things</u>. Of course, old people got me to accepting their "tales", but I never have been "orthodox"—have
      never after the common fashion said "maker" or "master" or "Creator" or "blessed Savior"
      or "Savior" or "the savior" or "holy Sabbath" &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c I never felt that I had sinned
      against God, nor was "sorry".☞ <u>They scared me tho'</u>, and made me think "God" would rather do so than not—to "play the Devil with" <u>me</u>. At 20 years of age, impressed by their falsehoods about <u>experimental</u> religion; in a time when there was no "revival", nor excitement, urgency, or favor
      or shield of nights darknes, <u>the Philosopher</u> walked up before a crowd, solitarily, and with a brave and yet reverential calmness,
      and joined the Methodist church "as a Seeker". I think I may say I challenged (with
      sufficient humbleness or modesty) God, Christ, and the Saints to ☞ fight [illegible] a fair fight.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>The result was that whereas I had been a [
      <span class="unclear">little?</span>]
       "blind", I soon began to "see" a good deal more than I had been seeing. Palpably,
      the saints thought we can't do much at "[
      <span class="unclear">casting?</span>]
       out" the sort of calm, critical, <u>healthy</u>, <u>philosophical</u> "Devils". What a fall was there my countrymen!—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The subject [
      <span class="unclear">has?</span>]
       been a life-time study with me, and I [
      <span class="unclear">would?</span>]
       have you know that at about 39 years I "got off the fence" on the Robert Ingersoll
      side of the question.<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r1">1</a></sup> (I dont admire <u>him</u> boundlessly—his fancy and his tongue seem to run away with him.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My personal experience in childhood, then, enables me to "see through" the claim that
      religious ideas are "innate"—they are not. ☞ If the population of the world were divided
      into <u>lots</u> of ten thousand—separated—minds a blank on the subject—and <u>one</u> person in each <u>lot</u> should think and say "<u>perhaps</u> the world" was "created", the others would be able to hear in time and accept the
      <u>fact</u> that <u>perhaps &amp;c &amp;c</u></p>
   
   
   <p>Intelligence impressed into a gnat or [illegible] and [illegible] things dimly seen [illegible] through smoke or a fog could suggest immaterial spiritual identities. <u>add</u> [illegible]. Let us dismiss spiritualism and immortality [illegible]) Right is that every being should enjoy all that it can enjoy without [
      <span class="unclear">injury?</span>]
       to others.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p><u>Practical</u> Right is [
      <span class="unclear">Conduct?</span>]
       which permits or promotes enjoyment of [illegible] Right.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Clashing or <u>differing</u> [illegible] must be compromized by electing [illegible] good without regard to numbers—[
      <span class="unclear">stick a pin?</span>]
       here.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The Perfect Judge is the [illegible], farthest-seeing <u>man</u> or <u>woman</u> or [illegible] <u>child</u> (as Ingersoll says children should never be whipped—suggestign that [illegible] may be found <u>there</u>.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Conscience is ideas of <u>Causes</u> and <u>Results</u>.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Ideas of Safety and Interest govern the <u>baser</u> conscience
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Satisfaction to the glorious sentiment of Love or Good-will "world without end" moves
      the man whom I love.
   </p> 
   
   
   <p><u>In addition, I</u> praise Pride, Courage, and Good Sense child of Free (and plentiful) Thought—Leaves
      of Grass does the same. Does W.W. wish to say "in all <u>orthodox</u> people behold! a secret silent loathing and despair? It looks like it ought to be
      [illegible] they have good sense!!!— A man who is trying to be a Kosmos ought to wish to correspond
      (interchange) in <u>long</u> letters with one who certainly <u>is</u> a Philosopher—especially where cruel circumstances make the latter's life <u>monotonous</u>. Proud, and independent, but not too much because well-willed and [illegible]
   </p>

   <p>P.S. Let others finish specimens. Nothing but [illegible] July 2, June, March</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0839">1. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r1">[back]
