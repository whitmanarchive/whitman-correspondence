   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00466_n14">1. This letter dates to
      November 25, 1865. The date, "November 25," is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      hand, and Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1865. Edwin Haviland Miller
      cited Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:377). Bucke's year 1865 is
      confirmed because the letter describes an alleged murder in Brooklyn City Park,
      which matches a late-November 1865 murder reported in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, and refers to two November 1865 reviews of <em>Drum-Taps</em>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n1">2. The reported murder occurred
      in the City Park, which borders the U.S. Navy Yard and was four blocks from
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's home on Portland Avenue near Myrtle. The <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>'s sensationalistic coverage began on
      Thursday, November 23, the day after the crime. The victim, later identified as
      Jose Garcia Otero, was a theater manager, and his body was found with over $200
      in cash and gold—reportedly he carried almost $10,000 when he left the
      Barcelona House, a boarding establishment. Two suspects were identified,
      Theodore Martinez Pellecer and Jose Gonzales, both Spanish nationals from Cuba;
      the weapons used to kill Otero were two razors and a dagger. The newspaper
      covered the case avidly and editorialized on city parks as havens for crime. See
      "Brutal Murder," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, November 23, 1865,
      3; "The City Park Murder," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, November
      24, 1865, 2).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n3">4. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      had returned to Brooklyn on October 17, after an extended visit to her daughter
      Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908) in Burlington, Vermont (see Walt
      Whitman's  letter to Ellen M.
      O'Connor). Hannah married Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a French-born
      landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his often
      offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. According to Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's  letter, Louisa decided to
      visit Hannah in late 1865 after a quarrel about "some women that Heyde had in
      his room."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n10">5. According to the review,
      "Whitman has done noble service in the war, but he is not a poet, for poetry
      needs music and imagination, not only the strong feeling and appreciation of
      nature which Whitman has. His fervent patriotism has produced only commonplace
      work, despite 'occasional sonorous lines and frequent thrilling passages.' He
      sins in assuming himself to be the most original and authoritative critic of
      this world" (see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.01070.html">"Literary. 'Drum-Taps,'" <em>Brooklyn Daily Union</em>,
         November 23, 1865, 2</a>).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n11">7. See Henry James, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00054.html">"Mr. Walt Whitman,"</a>
      <em>The Nation</em> 1 (16 November 1865), 625–626.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n4">8. Tom Rome (b. 1836) was a
      printer with A. H. Rome and Brothers, later Rome Brothers. His brother Andrew
      Rome, a friend of Walt Whitman, printed the first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1855. See Ed Folsom, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html"><em>Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</em></a> (University of Iowa: Obermann Center for Advanced
      Studies, 2005).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n5">9. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
      later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
      Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
      pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
      correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
      poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n6">10. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      November 19, 1865 letter is not extant. The Cornelius mentioned here may be
      Cornelius Van Velsor (1768–1837), Walt's maternal grandfather. Walt
      described him in <em>Specimen Days</em> as a "mark'd and full
      Americanized specimen" (<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html"><em>Complete Prose Works</em></a> [Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1892], 11).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">11. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00424_n5">12. James "Jimmy" Whitman was
      the son of Walt Whitman's brother Andrew Jackson Whitman (1827–1863) and
      Andrew's wife Nancy McClure Whitman. For more on Andrew's family, see Jerome M.
