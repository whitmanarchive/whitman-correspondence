   <p>Well I am still home &amp; no event of importance to write you about. My illness has passed
      over, &amp; I go around the same as formerly, only a lingering suspicion of weakness now
      &amp; then—I go out fishing &amp; have been out riding frequently—
   </p>
   
   <p>There is a hospital<sup><a href="#nyp.00192_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> here, containing a couple of hundred soldiers, it is only a quarter of a mile from
      our house, &amp; I go there a good deal—am going this afternoon to spend the afternoon
      &amp; evening—Strange as it may seem days &amp; days elapse without their having any visitors—So
      you see I am still in business—Some of the cases are very interesting—
   </p>
   
   <p>My mother is very well, &amp; the rest the same—We have heard from my brother up to the
      beginning of this month, he is well<sup><a href="#nyp.00192_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—We felt pretty gloomy some little time since, as two young men of the 51st N Y, friends
      of my brother George &amp; of our family (officers of 51st), were killed in battle within
      ten days of each other &amp; their bodies brought on for burial here<sup><a href="#nyp.00192_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Mother was at the funeral of each of them, &amp; I also—the regiment is on the Weldon
      road &amp; in a position of danger—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have seen Mrs Price, she speaks of you &amp; hopes to know you, she is only tolerably
      well—I have not seen Charles Howells<sup><a href="#nyp.00192_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> for some time—I shall write to William to-day—I rec'd a letter from Charles Eldridge
      yesterday, he was to pass through New York yesterday on his way to Boston for two
      or three weeks—"Drum Taps" is not yet begun to be printed—Nelly, I was much obliged
      for the photograph—it reminds me of you &amp; is good—how is dear little Jennie?—&amp; you,
      my dear dear friend, how are you in health &amp; spirits, &amp; have you had a good time—O
      how I should like to see you all again—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived with
      William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later John
      Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington years.
      William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor often complained about the
      various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his death. However, his
      government work was relieved by the presence of Whitman, whom he was to love and
      venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
      vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
      pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
      important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
      those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
      O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
      sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
      first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910], 513). For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see Deshae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00192_n100">1. The letter is endorsed,
      "Ans'd." &nbsp;The envelope for this letter bears the address: Ellen M O'Connor |
      Little Compton | Rhode Island. It is postmarked: Brooklyn N. Y. | Sep | 11 |
      18(?).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00192_n2">2. Ellen O'Connor was hurt
      when Whitman did not reply to her letters of , , , and . In the August 18 letter she said: "You will not think me
      foolish if I tell you that it hurt me a little, will you? You know what a
      foolish, absurd person I am, where I love any one as I do you, and knowing this,
      and now I having confessed, you will pardon."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00192_n3">3. Whitman most likely is
      referring to Brooklyn City Hospital, which Whitman visited in August and
      September.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00192_n4">4. Throughout August
      George's regiment was engaged in especially heavy fighting near Petersburg,
      Virginia, in which he repeatedly distinguished himself. John Gibson Wright,
      captain of the Fifty-first Regiment, reported on August 8, 1864 that, when he
      had to relinquish command of the regiment, George "discharged the duties of the
      responsible position to my entire satisfaction, and it affords me great pleasure
      to speak of the gallant manner in which he has Sustained himself during the
      entire campaign" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books,
      Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). (Wright rose from captain to
      colonel in the Fifty-first Regiment; he was appointed to the latter position on
      May 18, 1865. He was taken prisoner with George in 1864.)<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00192_n5">5. Captain Samuel H. Sims
      (see the letter from ) was killed
      on July 30, 1864, at Petersburg, Virginia, according to George's letter of .
      The other officer has not been identified.<a href="#r5">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00192_n7">7. William F. Channing
      (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
      Whitman stayed at his home in October 1868.<a href="#r7">[back]
