      Botta (1815–1891) was a teacher, a poet, and a sculptor. Her "literary"
      evenings in New York are mentioned in Bayard Taylor's <em>John
         Godfrey's Fortunes</em>. According to the <em>Memoirs of Anne
         C. L. Botta</em> (1894), 14, Poe gave his first public reading of "The
      Raven" at her home. Her evaluation of Walt Whitman's poetry appeared in her
      often reprinted <em>Handbook of Universal Literature</em> (1885
      ed.), 535: "Walt Whitman . . . writes with great force, originality, and
      sympathy with all forms of struggle and suffering, but with utter contempt for
      conventionalities and for the acknowledged limits of true art."<a href="#r1">[back]
