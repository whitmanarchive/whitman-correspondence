      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have nothing of consequence to write, but I thought I would send you a few lines
      anyhow. I have just written Nelly a letter, &amp; send to Little Compton—We are full of
      politics here, the dispute runs high &amp; hot everywhere—I think the Republicans are
      going to make a stout fight after all, as there is confusion in the opposition camp—the
      result of course I do not pretend to foretell—
   </p>
   
   <p>My health is quite re-established, yet not exactly the same unconscious state of health
      as formerly—The book is still unprinted—Our family are all well as usual—I go two
      or three times a week among the soldiers in hospital here—
   </p>
   
   <p>I go out quite regularly, sometimes out on the bay, or to Coney Island—&amp; occasionally
      a tour through New York life, as of old—last night I was with some of my friends of
      Fred Gray association,<sup><a href="#nyp.00193_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> till late wandering the east side of the City—first in the lager bier saloons &amp; then
      elsewhere—one crowded, low, most degraded place we went, a poor blear-eyed girl bringing
      beer. I saw her with a McClellan medal on her breast—I called her &amp; asked her if the
      other girls there were for McClellan<sup><a href="#nyp.00193_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> too—she said yes every one of them, &amp; that they wouldn't tolerate a girl in the place
      who was not, &amp; the fellows were too—(there must have been twenty girls, sad sad ruins)—it
      was one of those places where the air is full of the scent of low thievery, druggies,
      foul play, &amp; prostitution gangrened—
   </p>
   
   <p>I don't know what move I shall make, but something soon, as it is not satisfactory
      any more in New York &amp; Brooklyn—I should think nine tenths, of all classes, are copperheads
      here, I never heard before such things as I hear now whenever I go out—then it seems
      tame &amp; indeed unreal here, life as carried on &amp; as I come in contact with it &amp; receive
      its influences—
   </p>
   
   <p>How is Ashton? &amp; is he there again?<sup><a href="#nyp.00193_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I got a letter from Charley Eldridge yesterday—I suppose he is now in Boston—My dear
      friend, I often often think of you, &amp; count on our being together again, may be quite
      soon—meantime good bye &amp; God bless you &amp; I send you my best best love—

   <p>We are having a sloppy rainy dark Sunday here to-day—Lewis Brown (that was in ward
      K Armory Square) is a clerk in the Provost Marshall's office, cor 18th &amp; I sts<sup><a href="#nyp.00193_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I got a letter from him the other day—perhaps you may see him some time—I am going
      off for a couple of weeks soon, to Burlington, Vt.<sup><a href="#nyp.00193_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—O how the rain is pouring down as I write—at the other window sits my mother reading
      the Sunday Herald—quiet &amp; pleasant &amp; soothing—only us two home to-day—not a word spoken
      in a long time—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived with
      William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later John
      Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington years.
      William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor often complained about the
      various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his death. However, his
      government work was relieved by the presence of Whitman, whom he was to love and
      venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
      vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
      pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
      important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
      those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
      O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
      sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
      first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910], 513). For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see Deshae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00193_n100">1. The letter is endorsed,
      "Answ'd." &nbsp;The envelope for this letter bears the address: William D O'Connor |
      Light house Board Treasury | Department | Washington | D C. It is postmarked:
      Brooklyn N. Y. | Sep | 11 | 1864.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00193_n2">2. See Whitman's letter from
      
      . Since Gray had
      written on , to Whitman that "we are
      suddenly ordered away to the South-west. I will write when we get
      settled",
      he was probably not present.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00193_n3">3. General George Brinton
      McClellan (1826–1885) was General-in-Chief of the Army of the United
      States from November 1861, until July 1862, when he was replaced by General
      Henry W. Halleck. In 1864, when McClellan ran for the presidency, the Democratic
      party split between war Democrats and peace Democrats. To satisfy the war
      Democrats McClellan was nominated; to satisfy the peace Democrats C. L.
      Vallandigham and his followers were allowed to draft the platform. Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman evidently considered the entire Democratic party as "the peace
      party" as evidenced from the letter to his brother Walt dated .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00193_n4">4. On , O'Connor had reported that Ashton
      was "at Schooley's Mountain, New York,
      vacationizing."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00193_n5">5. Brown informed Whitman of
      his appointment on .
      Lewis Kirke Brown (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near
      Rappahannock Station on August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days.
      Eventually he was transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him,
      probably in February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman
      described Brown on February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond
      of having me come and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was
      amputated on January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in
      a diary (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of
      Congress, Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was
      employed in the Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's letter from
      
      . The following
      September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief
      of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until his retirement
      in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was prepared by Brown's
      family and is now held in the Library of Congress.)<a href="#r5">[back]

      Hannah's letter to Whitman on ,
      of a visit to her in September.<a href="#r6">[back]
