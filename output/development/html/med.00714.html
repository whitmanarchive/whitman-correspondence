   <p>I should like the little <em>Presidential canvass poem</em><sup><a href="#col.00012_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> to go in the paper of Sunday Oct
      26—I think that time would be opportune—Send me word (by note) if that
      suits you—&amp; if so I will send it two or three days beforehand.
   </p>
   
   <p>As I am writing to you I enclose the rec't for the Red Jacket bit<sup><a href="#col.00012_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Talcott Williams
      (1849–1928) was associated with the New York <em>Sun</em>
      and <em>World</em> as well as the Springfield <em>Republican</em> before he became the editor of the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in 1879. His newspaper vigorously defended Whitman
      in news articles and editorials after the Boston censorship of 1882. For more
      information about Williams, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_108.html">Williams, Talcott (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
