      <br></br><br></br>Dear "Walt Whitman"—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>For years I have owed you a debt. I would not say it in any other way—so I am
      trying to get others to take from you just as largely. I am writing a paper for one
      of our Boston Clubs—and it is to be all about you—in your <u>Leaves</u> of Grass. Of course it has all been better said,
      but I must have my chance just the same.  I am defending your <u>Children of Adam</u>. All at once it occurs to me:
      "Why—these were written years ago. He is older now. He may wish he had written
      differently. In a few years I may not defend them so vehemently. I had better ask
      him what I shall say." So—this letter goes to trouble you. I want more than I
      can tell, to go to you, to sit beside you and talk about death and life; I know how
      birth and the beginning  of birth seem to you now—after these years of illness and
      years of religious thought—and years of looking into the far future. You may
      not be able to write—but what can I do? Shall I go on and will you trust me to
      say that every line, if rightly read, will give help? 
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Walt Whitman: For years I have wanted to write to you—but knew I had no
      right to take your minutes and your strength. Now I seem
      compelled—yet—fear to trouble. Forgive me  if I need not have come even
      now—and believe me—your grateful friend—and—may I not say
      lover?
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ada H. Spaulding (b. 1841),
      née Pearsons, was a socialite and active member of various
      reform-movements and women's clubs. She served as the President
      of the Home Club of East Boston and was a member of the Women's Educational
      and Industrial Union. She married Ebenezer Spaulding, an Assistant Surgeon
      during the Civil War, and, later, a homeopathic physician and surgeon who practiced
      in Boston.
      Spaulding read and admired Whitman's poetry, and she wrote the poet
      a number of letters in his final years. For more on Spaulding, see Sherry Ceniza,
      "Women's Letters to Walt 
      Whitman: Some Corrections," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 9 (Winter 1992),
