   <p>Sir: whether it agrees with your own opinion or not I hope you will open your columns
      to this communication of mine, seeking to stir up the government to a general exchange
      of prisoners.<sup><a href="#nyp.00195_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup> I hope also you may feel to say a word about it editorially—if you could call attention
      to it.
   </p>
   
   <p>As I have sent similar communications this afternoon to one or two other papers, I
      would particularly solicit that you find room for it in tomorrow's issue.

   <p id="nyp.00195_n100">1. This is the draft of a
      letter written to the editor of the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>
      or the <em>New York Times</em> to accompany a communication
      entitled "The Prisoners," which was to appear on December 27, 1864 (reprinted by
      Charles I. Glicksberg, <em>Walt Whitman and the Civil War</em>
      [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1933], 178–180). Whitman
      assailed the Secretary of War and General Butler for their attitudes toward the
      exchange of prisoners.<a href="#r1">[back]
