   <p id="rlc.00020_n2">2. Schmidt was quoted in <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1889), 53–54. The volume, edited by Horace Traubel, collected notes
      and addresses that were delivered at Whitman's seventieth birthday celebration

   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
