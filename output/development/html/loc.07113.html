      note<sup><a href="#loc.07113_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> just received. There is more "non 
      aurthodox
      
       passion" among your friends than perhaps you are aware of. Though we do
      not set up and curse the (modern) Pharisees as Christ (or far more likely his
      friends did) yet we feel it. It is there all the same. We do not and cannot go with
      Ingersoll<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r4">4</a></sup> in his refusals and denials but we like the man
      and we should be foolish to do anything to deter him from giving us his
      friendship
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>and support. We want the conservative, orthodox folk (all we can get of them) and
      we
      are getting a good many (I have a letter this morning from a young presbytarian 
      clergiman
      
      <sup><a href="#n5000" id="r5">5</a></sup>—a good friend of yours) but we want (to my
      mind) the independent freethinkers even more since the immediate future (I fancy)
      belongs to them. I think you are right to stand aside (personally) from this
      I[ingersoll]. demonstration<sup><a href="#loc.07113_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> but for my part (as a friend
      of the cause) I look upon it (and think you should) with great complacency. I think
      therefore that you are entirely wrong to be "annoyed" at a demonstration in your
      favor even if it were entirely by freethinkers—they cannot alter you or your
      teaching and (on the contrary) you will undoubtedly, in the end, alter many of them
      and will have (in the end) in all probability your most extreme partisans &amp;
      lovers from this section of humanity. As for I. being "solicited" it seems to me
      that is neither here nor there—your friends have a right to do what seems best
      to them in such matters—their action does not affect you—you stand aside
      and let them act. That is all. For my part nothing
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>could give me greater satisfaction than a rousing demonstration on the part of I.
      and
      his friends and I shall take part in it (if I can) with a good heart. I do heartily
      agree with you however in wishing that the affair could come off in N.Y. Could not
      this be managed? I shall write to Johnston<sup><a href="#n0336" id="r7">7</a></sup> on this point.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n6121">2. James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="n0839">4. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.07113_n3">6. In his letter of  Bucke quoted a letter from John H.
      Johnston: "This morning an hours talk with Ingersoll and I got his promise and
      authority to proceed and get up a lecture entertainment by him for Walt's
      benefit—in Phila I guess—Shall I put you on committee?" In his  letter to Bucke, Whitman wrote that
      being affiliated with Ingersoll and "freethinking folks" was "annoying" to him,
      despite the poet's deep respect for Ingersoll. See also Whitman's  letter to John H. Johnston.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0336">7. John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
