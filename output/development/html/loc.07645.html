   <p>Pleasant weather warmish but not hot—my body strength &amp; head grip low ebb

      bowel quite decided—used (instigated) (by a little syringe a little longer than
      your small finger) a small injection of glycerine—young Dr. Mitchell<sup><a href="#loc.07644_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> suggested
      it yesterday afternoon—I feel better I suppose as I sit here, but my head is

      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07645_n1">1. This letter is addressed
      to: Dr R M Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden
      (?) | Jul (?) | 6 PM | 88.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07644_n2">2. During Dr. William
      Osler's absence, beginning on July 8, Whitman was attended by Dr. J. K.
      Mitchell, son of S. Weir Mitchell (see Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.102.html">Sunday, July 8, 1888</a>). For Whitman's opinion of the young man, see
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.106.html">Thursday, July 12, 1888</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n0129">3. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.07645_n2">4. On , Burroughs recommended "raw clams"
      which "are very strengthening" and hoped that Walt Whitman would be strong
      enough in the fall to go to the seashore with him. Burroughs was still
      depressed: "I try to keep absorbed in my farm operations. It is much better for
      me than to mope about, nibbling at literature. . . . I do no writing at
      all."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07510_n2">5. Whitman was at this time
      reading proofs for <em>November Boughs</em> and asking friends to
      read them as well.<a href="#r5">[back]
