   <p>I send you here two stanzas written by me and addressed to you.<sup><a href="#n0832" id="r1">1</a></sup> I have taken this
      liberty at the suggestion of my uncle Mr Symonds,<sup><a href="#loc.04162_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> to whom I showed the verses, and by
      whom I was assured that my sending them would not be looked upon by you in the light
      of an impertinence. With the  exception of a single line they are just as I wrote them two
      years ago some few weeks after your book first fell into my hands Mr Symonds [
      <span class="unclear">bids?</span>]
       me
      tell you something of myself. I was born in the year 1860. I am second son of what
      is here called a "country-gentleman" I have never been to any of our great public
      schools, but have got the little I know of the classics under various private tutors. I
      hope by next 
      Christmass
      
       to have entered Balliol College Oxford. Owing to my want of a public-school training,
      I have not as yet been able to do much in the way of athletics I
      hope however when I get up to Oxford to do some rowing. With many hopes that you
      continue better in health

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0832">1. John St. Loe Strachey
      (1860–1927) was a British journalist, and for a time was the editor of <em>The Spectator</em>. He was the second son of Sir Edward
      Strachey and Mary Isabella Symonds, sister of John Addington Symonds.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04162_n1">2. See the letter from John Addington Symonds
      to Walt Whitman on . Symonds
      (1840–1893), a prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in
      Victorian England, was author of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well as <em>Walt
         Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of Michelangelo's
      sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class English
      homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic poetry
      and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it was then
      known (Andrew Higgins, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840-1893]</a>).<a href="#r2">[back]
