   </p>
   
   
   <p>Since i received your Papers last monday<sup><a href="#uva.00363_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> i have been Very
      anxious to write to you but the Death of one of my Cousins delayed me somewhat &amp;
      yet there is nothing unusual going on here I believe the road is running the same
      as
      when you went away with the exception of our new President During Monday &amp;
      Tuesday there was a good deal of excitement over the elections in the several states
      but today it has got back to old standing there is also a report out here that there
      was a Plot to assasinate the President but i dont think there is any truth in the
      report<sup><a href="#uva.00363_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      all the boys send their love
      <br></br>Pete x x 
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>I sent you a letter last sunday<sup><a href="#uva.00363_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843â€“1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
