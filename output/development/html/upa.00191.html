   <p id="upa.00191_n2">2. Whitman was accompanied
      by Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke, who had come to Camden on May 25. See also <em>Specimen Days</em> (ed. Floyd Stovall [New York: New York
      University Press, 1963], 236–237). On June 1 Whitman made a new will in
      which he appointed George and his wife as executor and executrix. At the time he
      had approximately $1000 in the Brooklyn Savings Bank and about $800 in the
      National State Bank in Camden. He bequeathed four-sevenths of his estate to
      Edward and one-seventh each to Mary Van Nostrand, Hannah Heyde, and his nieces,
      Mannahatta and Jessie (Whitman House, Camden).<a href="#r2">[back]
