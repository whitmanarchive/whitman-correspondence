      teacher, a poet, and a sculptor. Her "literary" evenings in New York are
      mentioned in Bayard Taylor's <em>John Godfrey's Fortunes</em>.
      According to the <em>Memoirs of Anne C. L. Botta</em> (1894), 14,
      Poe gave his first public reading of "The Raven" at her home. Her evaluation of
      Walt Whitman's poetry appeared in her often-reprinted <em>Handbook
         of Universal Literature</em> (1885 ed.), 535: "Walt Whitman . . . writes
      with great force, originality, and sympathy with all forms of struggle and
      suffering, but with utter contempt for conventionalities and for the
      acknowledged limits of true art."
