      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter of Aug 26th reached me in due time.<sup><a href="#loc.00609_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> I had began to think (allmost) that you had forgotten me. Then I imagined that some press of work had prevented
      your writing me sooner. Well as for myself (And I have nothing elese to write about) I am at work on a Farm at present. And managing to save $30.00 per
      month. Considerable leisure time, entertaining Books, good company. My employer is
      at home but a very small portion of his time. Have enjoyed myself pretty well (Hard
      times when I cannot) considering that I am Just from so much excitement when compared
      with this. Have been reading, Our Old Home (by Nathaniel Hawthorne,) Home and Abroad (by B. Taylor)
      Color Guard (by J. R. Hosmer) all light reading but entertaining, for news I have
      the Buffalo Express (daily). So you see dear friend that I am pretty well provided
      for. I should like very much to see you and be with you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Corry is a pretty rough place. Property is very valuable. it is the Junction of three
      R.R. Atlantic &amp; Great Western, Pa &amp; Erie and Oil Creek. Large Refineries, Saw Mills,
      Manufactorys are located here and doing a flourishing Business. Lots with the stumps &amp; logs on
      are sold at the rate of $40.00 per foot.
   </p>
   
   <p>This winter I shall either learn a trade of go to School, I shall be governed by circumstances.</p>
   
   <p>The Weather is very warm for this time of the season considerable rain has fallen
      lately but the weather is quite pleasant nevertheless.
   </p>
   
   <p>Seems to me you are about to leave Washington in its most pleasant season. I was allmost delighted with the fall of the year in that climate.</p>
   
   <p>Dont have any good pictures here. People are thinking more of money here than of Beauty.</p>
   
   <p>Sometimes I have disputes with the detested Copperheads. I treat them rather uncivilly.
      Havent any special regard for them.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope you will write me a long letter. Your letter was very interesting to me—very
      valuable. Well Good Old Friend I must bid you good night.

      Byron Sutherland, a soldier, between 1865 and 1870. On September 20, 1868, he
      wrote to Sutherland: "I retain just the same friendship I formed for you the
      short time we were together, (but intimate,) in 1865" (Henry W. and Albert A.
      Berg Collection, New York Public Library; Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:44–45).
