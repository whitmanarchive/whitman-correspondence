      <br></br>Brooklyn,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Friday afternoon, Sept. 10, 1869.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete—dear son,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received your letter of the 8th to-day—all your letters have come
      safe—four altogether. This is the third I have sent you (besides that one by
      Adams' Express, Aug. 23d.)<sup><a href="#loc.01522_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, you say my sickness must be worse than I described in my letters—&amp;
      ask me to write precisely how I am. No, dearest boy, I wrote just as it really was.
      But, Pete, you will now be truly happy to learn that I am feeling all right, &amp;
      have been mainly so for the last four days—&amp; have had no bad spells all
      that time. Yesterday I thought I felt as strong &amp; well as ever in my
      life—in fact real young &amp; jolly. I loafed around New York most all
      day—had a first-rate good time. All along Broadway hundreds of rich flags
      &amp; streamers at half-mast for Gen. Rawlins'<sup><a href="#loc.01522_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      funeral—From the tall buildings, they waved out in a stiff west wind all
      across Broadway—late in the afternoon I rode up from the Battery to look at
      them, as the sun struck through them—I thought I had never seen any thing so
      curious &amp; beautiful—On all the shipping, ferry boats, public buildings
      &amp;c. flags at half mast too. This is the style here. No black drapery, for
      mourning—only thousands of flags at half mast, on the water as well as
      land—for any big bug's funeral.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To-day I am all right too. It is now towards 3—Mother &amp; I have just had our
      dinner, (my mammy's own cooking mostly.) I have been out all the forenoon knocking
      around—the water is my favorite recreation—I could spend two or three
      hours every day of my life here, &amp; never get tired—Some of the pilots are
      dear personal friends of mine—some, when we meet, we kiss each other (I am an
      exception to all their customs with others)—some of their boys have grown up
      since I have known them, &amp; they too know me &amp; are very friendly.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, the fourth week of my vacation is most ended. I shall return the middle of next
      week.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Give my love to Johnny Lee<sup><a href="#loc.01522_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—let him read this letter, &amp; then return it to you. Dear
      Jack, I rec'd your affectionate letter of Sept. 5th.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, I have seen Tom Haslett<sup><a href="#loc.01522_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—he is well—he is working extra on Broadway &amp;
      42d st. RR. He does not think of going home till Christmas. Jimmy Foy<sup><a href="#loc.01522_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> has not got work yet.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you got "Kenilworth" I sent.</p>
   
   
   <p>Well, boy, I shall now take a bath, dress myself &amp; go out, cross the river, put
      this letter in the p. o. &amp; then ramble &amp; ride around the City, awhile, as I
      think we are going to have a fine evening &amp; moonlight &amp;c.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Good bye, dear son—We will soon be together again.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01522_n1">1. Apparently lost. It
      probably contained the money order mentioned in Whitman's  letter to Doyle.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01522_n2">2. General John Aaron
      Rawlins (1831–1869) was Grant's aide-de-camp during the Civil War and
      Secretary of War in 1869.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01522_n3">3. Probably a laborer or a
      conductor. The 1869 Directory listed, however, a number of John Lees.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01522_n4">4. Perhaps Whitman intended
      to write "Hassett," the Washington conductor mentioned in his  letter to Doyle.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01522_n5">5. A railroad worker, cited
      in one of Whitman's address books (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt
