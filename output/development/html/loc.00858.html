      note by Whitman following the closer that reads, "June 25th '65—I have rec'd

      of Grass"—&amp; some singular ones from soldiers—but never before one of this
      description—I keep it as a <em>curiosity</em>. The writer was one
      of the soldiers in Sherman army last of [illegible]—one of hundreds I talked with, &amp; occasionaly showed some little kindness
