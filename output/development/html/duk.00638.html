   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00638_n4">1. This letter dates to March
      30, 1869. Richard Maurice Bucke's date for this letter is somewhat ambiguous.
      After assigning the date February or March 1869, he then added a phrase "Not[?]
      March," though his word "Not" is unclear. All dates that Edwin Haviland Miller
      assigned in February or March 1869 are associated with other letters (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:367), so Miller may not have assigned a date
      for this letter. Bucke's month March can be confirmed on the basis of numerous
      contextual consistencies. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote in her own hand the
      day of the week Tuesday and the calendar date "30," and she wrote that some
      activities are "prepa[tory?] to moving." She moved from 1149 Atlantic Avenue to
      71 Portland Avenue at the end of April 1869 (see her  letter to Walt Whitman). The letter is
      consistent also with Walt's recent receipt of his brother Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's March 25, 1869 letter on his family's housing situation in St. Louis
      (presumably reported to Louisa by Walt in a letter not extant) and with the mass
      dismissal of female clerks in the Treasury Department at the end of March
      1869.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">2. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00638_n2">3. In her  letter to Walt Whitman, Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman wrote that George Washington Whitman (1829–1901), Walt's
      brother, "expects he will have to go to the foundry." George was going to the R.
      D. Wood Foundry in Camden, New Jersey, to inspect the "new main" for Moses Lane,
      chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works. George was the sixth child of Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      He enlisted in the Union Army 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of
      the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December
      1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864).
      After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on
      speculation, with a partner known only as Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For
      more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00638_n5">4. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      originally wrote "straighed" and then canceled the "d" by writing an "n" over it
      when she resumed writing, producing "straighened."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00638_n11">5. George Washington Whitman
      was building a house that he would share with his mother Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman and brother Edward. Louisa reported regularly on the progress of
      George's house since he commenced building it (see her  letter to Walt Whitman). The house was
      located at 71 Portland Avenue, and Louisa moved into George's house at the end
      of April (see her  letter
      to Walt).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00515_n4">6. Margret Steers, her husband
      Thomas Steers (1826–1869), and their four children Thomas (b. 1853),
      Caroline (b. 1857), Louisa (b. 1862), and Margret (b. 1865) moved into the
      Atlantic Avenue building in November 1868. Thomas Steers operated a bakery, and
      his wife, who would become a close friend of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,
      continued the business when he died in January 1869. After Thomas Steers' sudden
      death, Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman replied to an early 1869 letter from
      Louisa (not extant) with concern that "Mr. Steers' death had quite an effect on
      you." George Washington Whitman sold a property to Margaret Steers in January
      1871, and the property had title trouble with regard to unpaid assessments (see
      Mattie Whitman's February? 1869 letter to Louisa in Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1977], 67; Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman; "Died,"
      <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, January 22, 1869, 3; <em>United States Census, 1870</em>. New York, Brooklyn Ward 7,
      Kings, District 1; and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00638_n13">7. See Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's March 25, 1869 letter to Walt Whitman (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M.
      Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson
         Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984],
      136–139). Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was
      Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff eventually became
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally recognized name. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>." <a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00638_n8">8. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman. According to Jeff's  letter
      to Walt Whitman, Mattie and Jeff initially settled in a hotel in January, moved
      to a boarding house on Pine Street in March, departed after a week to another
      boarding house, and would seek a more permanent place. Mattie and Jeff had two
      daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. Jeff moved to St. Louis in 1867 to
      assume the position of Superintendent of Water Works. For more on Mattie, see
      Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha
         Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      1–26.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00638_n12">9. Ulysses S. Grant
      (1822–1885) was elected President of the United States in 1868 as the
      candidate of the Republican party. This letter was written very early in his
      first term. Grant was the most successful and highest ranking Union general of
      the Civil War. As commander of the Army of the Potomac, he accepted the
      surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox. He served two consecutive terms as
      president.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00638_n3">10. The postscript is in the
      right margin of the page. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman refers to the widespread
      layoffs in the Treasury Department. The Printing Bureau planned to terminate
      seventy female and fifteen male employees at the end of the March. In the
      Government Printing Office, seventy-five "females" were discharged from the
      folding room. An unstated number of "females" were discharged from the bindery.
      The dismissals were to come "from the least efficient and most obnoxious,
      politically, of the employe[e]s" (see "Washington: The Contest Between the
      Senate and the House on the Tenure-of-Office Bill—Great Reduction of the
      Clerical Force in the Departments—Discharge of Female Clerks," <em>New York Times</em>, March 28, 1869, 1). The discharge of
      Treasury Department employees was followed by Louisa in part because Walt
      Whitman's close friend William D. O'Connor served there. A week later Walt
      reported that his "situation in the office continues the same" and that "William
      is still in the Treasury Dep't" (see Walt's  letter to Abby H. Price).<a href="#r10">[back]
