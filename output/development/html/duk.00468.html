   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00468_n14">1. This letter dates to
      December 3, 1865. "December 3" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard
      Maurice Bucke dated the letter to 1865, and Edwin Haviland Miller also dated the
      letter to December 3, 1865 (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:377). December 3 fell on a Sunday in 1865—Louisa wrote "it is
      sunday"—and the date is consistent both with the recent dismissal of
      workers in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and with similar family topics in Louisa's
       letter to Walt
      Whitman.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00468_n1">2. Neither letter from Walt
      Whitman is extant. Edwin Haviland Miller dated the letter from "yesterday,"
      December 1, 1865 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:365). The Monday or Tuesday
      letter, not noted by Miller, would date November 26?, 1865 (cf. <em>The Correspondence</em>, 1:365).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00468_n10">3. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., resided in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles L.
      Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among
      the Whitmans for his offensive letters and treatment of Hannah. Louisa in her
       letter to Walt Whitman had
      labeled Heyde a "little conceited fool." According to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman's  letter to Walt, Louisa
      visited Hannah in September 1865 because of a quarrel about "some women that
      Heyde had in his room."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00468_n2">4. After a month-long furlough,
      Walt Whitman returned to Washington on November 7, 1865. See Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:267, n. 57.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00468_n4">6. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      account was based on the reports in the Democratic-leaning<em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>. The Navy Yard workers were organized by
      profession: carpenters, plumbers, caulkers, etc. The dismissal of workers was in
      part connected to post-war demobilization. Though sympathetic to striking
      workers, the newspaper was generally hostile to the "bosses" in the large
      federal labor force, which it considered beholden to the Republican
      administration. For articles that address recent layoffs, anxiety about the
      political power of the yard bosses, and a caulker's strike, see "The Political
      Guillotine at Work, Excitement in the Navy Yard" and "The Navy Yard" (<em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, December 5, 1865, 2). Jake Striker,
      if an individual boss in the Navy Yard, has not been identified. The name may
      also have been a derogatory term for striking workers. The reason for Louisa's
      animus against a particular man is unknown—and is contrary to her usual
      sympathy for discharged workers—but her son George Washington Whitman may
      have crossed a politically powerful yard boss in his housebuilding
      business.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00468_n24">7. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      was thrifty during the war because she hoped to preserve her own funds for the
      future (see her  letter
      to Walt Whitman). Walt had encouraged her to use George Washington Whitman's
      substantial military pay to buy better food for herself and for his brother
      Andrew Jackson Whitman during his illness, and Walt had enlisted George to
      pressure their mother to spend more freely from George's pay (see Walt's  letter to Louisa and George's  letter to Louisa). Louisa's
      careful husbanding helped George to finance his speculative housebuilding
      business after the war, but in this letter Louisa regrets having exhausted the
      bank book in her own name. As no particular one-time expense is noted in her
      letters, her savings probably diminished gradually for living expenses.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00468_n5">8. The "last one" is Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt
      Whitman. Her mention of "bad paper" in the present letter is consistent with the
      earlier letter, in which she lamented that her paper was "soiled and rather
      scanty."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">9. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00468_n6">10. Fishkill is approximately 70
      miles north of Brooklyn.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00472_n2">11. Jessie Louisa Whitman
      (1863–1957) was the younger daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman
      and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and sister-in-law.
      Jessie and her sister Manahatta "Hattie" were both favorites of their uncle
      Walt. The nickname "Sis" was given first to Manahatta but was passed to her
      younger sister Jessie Louisa when Manahatta became "Hattie." The letter dates to
      1865, so "Sis" is Jessie Louisa.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>

      Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman

   <p id="duk.00432_n21">13. Nancy McClure Whitman was
      the widowed wife of Andrew Jackson Whitman. For the identification of McClure as
      Nancy's maiden name and information on Andrew's wife and children, see Jerome M.

   <p id="duk.00425_n13">14. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r14">[back]
