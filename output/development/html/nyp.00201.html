      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter came right—&amp; was glad to hear from you, Nelly, &amp; Charles Eldridge &amp; dear
      little Jeannie—(I will not add William because I did not hear any thing about him.)<sup><a href="#nyp.00201_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Nelly, the skies are brighter here than when I wrote you last. Little sis is so much
      better, that she has been twice brought down here to the front basement, &amp; has in
      every respect improved much since last Saturday—Then my mother arrived home last Tuesday—and
      now it looks something like <em>home</em> in reality—I am quite well—
   </p>
   
   <p>Drum Taps will be bound (a small edition) before you get this—&amp; will next week be
      put in the hands of a New York publisher &amp; launched on the market—at least that's
      my design at present<sup><a href="#nyp.00201_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p> 
   
   <p>When you write tell me all about William—My mother returns bringing cheerful intelligence
      upon the whole—&amp; is herself in splendid condition—havn't seen her look &amp; apparently feel better in many years—My brother George (or did I
      tell you?) is working again at his trade &amp; has grand health—Love &amp; Farewell—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen O'Connor, who, with Eldridge and later Burroughs, were
      to be his close associates during the early Washington years. William D.
      O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>,
      an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. Ellen "Nelly"
      O'Connor, William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In
      1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with William over the Fifteenth
      Amendment, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended
      Whitman's opinion, and in response William established a separate residence. The
      correspondence between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's
      correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>.
