      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your two postals came duly to hand—the last on the 2d of last month—but
      the letter there in announced has not come. It is now too late I presume to expect
      it:
   </p>
   
   <p>I will say for Mr 
      Laforgue<sup><a href="#n3132" id="r1">1</a></sup> that he is glad of your <u>permission</u> to translate "Leaves of Grass" &amp; that he expects to make of
      it an interesting Volume<sup><a href="#syr.00008_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>We want to publish it with a preface in the shape of a biographical sketch. It would
      be pleasant to have facts in your life not yet published: your youth, how you gave yourself on the
      battlefield during the war, etc. Would you have the strength &amp; the inclination
      to furnish us such?
   </p>
   
   <p>I am sorry to learn thro' the papers that you are permanently disabled physically.
      I
      trust that the appearance of your poems  in a foreign dress will have a
      happy pecuniary result. In any event you have too many friends on both sides the
      ocean ever to be forgotten.
   </p>
   
   <p>As the interpreter of the little group here I am the bearer of many good words</p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Ever yours sincerely
      <br></br>R. Brisbane

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>R. Brisbane was a French admirer of
      Whitman and apparently a collaborator on a planned translation of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> into French.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3132">1. Jules Laforgue (1860–1887)
      was a French free-verse poet born in Uruguay. Laforgue, whose work mixed
      symbolism with impressionism, became one of Whitman's most important supporters
      in France, and he translated thirty-four of Whitman's poems, published in <em>La Vogue</em> in 1886. Shortly after receiving Whitman's
      permission to translate <em>Leaves of Grass</em> as a whole in
      1887, he died of tuberculosis.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="syr.00008_n1">2. Horace Traubel asked Whitman
      about this project a few years later: "Did this scheme ever come to anything?"
      [Whitman] shook his head: "No: to nothing." Then he quietly chuckled: "But
      that's not surprising, not exceptional: my schemes never came to anything."
      "Then there were none of the pecuniary results Brisbane speaks of?" "Least of
      all, pecuniary results: does anything I do ever have pecuniary results? When I
      think of all the schemes—some of them mine, some of them from
      others—designed to establish for Leaves of Grass some plausible wordly
      estate, I am struck with amazement—almost consternation. George once said
      to me: 'Walt, hasn't the world made it plain to you that it'd rather not have
      your book?" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
