   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00611_n1">1. This letter dates to January
      12, 1869. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter 1873. Edwin Haviland Miller
      dated it 1869 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:361; 2:367), and Randall H.
      Waldron agreed with Miller's date (<em>Walt Whitman: An Extensive
         Collection of Holograph Letters written to Walt Whitman by His Mother Mrs.
         L. Whitman</em>, vol. 2, 1868–1873, note for letter 121, Trent
      Collection, Duke University). Sherry Ceniza used the package that Louisa sent to
      daughter Hannah (Whitman) Heyde to date this letter 1872 (<em>Walt
         Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers</em> [Tuscaloosa: University of
      Alabama Press, 1998], 10, 242, n. 1). Bucke's date is incorrect because Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman was in Brooklyn, not Camden. The year 1872 (Ceniza) is
      plausible, but the year 1869 (Miller and Waldron) is correct, primarily because
      this letter echoes a January 1869 letter from Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman.
      Waldron observed, "the letter from Mattie to which [this letter] refers was
      written 1/7/1969" (<em>Walt Whitman: An Extensive Collection</em>,
      vol. 2, 1868–1873, note for letter 121). This letter has many paraphrases
      and near verbatim quotations from Mattie's January 1869 letter: on her cough, on
      the family's living arrangement in a parlor, and on the cost of their board (see
      Mattie Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, January 7, 1869, Randall D.
      Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 63–64).
      Louisa received Mattie's letter "yesterday," and four or five days was the usual
      time for mail from St. Louis to Brooklyn. Louisa's verbal echoes of Mattie's
      January 7, 1869 letter are too many to be disputed. The date 1869 is further
      affirmed by Louisa's concern that Walt Whitman will find a "better room": he was
      dissatisfied with the residence of Mrs. Newton Benedict (see his  letter to Louisa) but had returned
      to the Benedicts in early November 1868. In addition, the brief mention of the
      house on which George Washington Whitman is working (at 71 Portland Avenue) is
      consistent with Louisa's late April 1869 move to that house.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n5">3. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided
      in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a
      French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for
      his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00611_n4">4. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided
      in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1892).
      Hannah in late 1868 suffered a serious thumb infection that led Dr. Samuel
      Thayer to lance her wrist in November. In early December Dr. Thayer amputated
      Hannah's thumb. For Louisa's report to Walt Whitman on the initial surgery,
      which is based on a letter from Charles, see her  letter to Walt. For the surgical
      amputation of Hannah's thumb, see Charles Heyde's early December letter to
      Louisa (Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews
         &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 225). Edwin Haviland Miller dated
      Heyde's letter "[a]bout December 8" (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:72–73, n. 37).<a href="#r4">[back]

      Louisa's preparation of gift boxes, which Sherry Ceniza has designated "care
      packages" and compared to Whitman's poetry, see <em>Walt Whitman

   <p id="duk.00425_n2">6. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00611_n6">7. See Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman's January 7, 1869 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Randall H.
      Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 63–64).
      Louisa's description of living arrangements in this letter is an extended
      paraphrase with many near quotations from Mattie's letter. Mattie
      (1836–1873) was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt
      Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa.
      In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved
      there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie
      suffered a throat ailment that led to her death in February 1873. For more on
      Mattie, see Waldron, 1–26.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00611_n13">8. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      comment probably expresses some shock that one could spend such an extravagant
      monthly sum for meals. Randall D. Waldron doubts that the figure could be
      accurate (<em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 75). However, Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's salary of $6000 per year was able to support boarding expense of such
      magnitude (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00611_n11">9. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      refers to the house that George Washington Whitman was building at 71 Portland
      Avenue. She and son Edward moved from 1149 Atlantic Avenue to the Portland house
      at the end of April 1869 (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman). For more on George's
      housebuilding business, see Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975], 30).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00611_n9">10. Walt Whitman had expressed
      dissatisfaction with the boarding arrangement in a room owned by Mrs. Newton
      Benedict at 472 M Street (see his 
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman). But Walt had returned to Mrs. Benedict's
      house in late October or early November 1868 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:69). Also see Kim Roberts, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00925.pdf">A
