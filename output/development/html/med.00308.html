      his attempts to arrange for the exchange of George, who was in a Confederate
      prison at that time; see Whitman's letter to William D. O'Connor of .<br><br>
      In Whitman scholarship, this letter traditionally has been identified as "to
      Dana F. Wright," based on Wright's signature at the end of his  letter to Whitman. Descendants
      of Wright as well as military roster and census data confirm Wright's first
      name as David.
