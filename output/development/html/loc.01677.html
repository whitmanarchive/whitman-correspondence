   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01677_n1">1. The executors dated this
      letter 1877. However, November 8 was on Monday in 1875 (see the letter from
      Whitman to Doyle of ). On November
      3 Whitman had promised Doyle definite word about his plans by Saturday; this
      letter was sent on Friday, November 5.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01677_n2">2. Doyle replied on  that he would meet Whitman at the depot
      on the following day, and that Mr. and Mrs. Nash "told me to tell you to come on
      and they would do the best they Could to make your Visit pleasant."<a href="#r2">[back]
