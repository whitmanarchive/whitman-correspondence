      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was away from England when your volumes reached me, &amp; since my return (during the
      last six weeks) I have been very ill with an attack of hemorrhage from the lung—brought
      on while riding a pulling horse at a time when I was weak from cold.<sup><a href="#loc.04208_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> This must account for 
      
      
      my delay in writing to thank you for them &amp; to express the great pleasure which your
      inscription in two of the volumes has given me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I intend to put into my envelope a letter to you with some verses from one of your
      great admirers in England.<sup><a href="#loc.04063_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> It is my nephew—
      
      
      the second son of my sister who married Sir Edward Strachey, a Somersetshire baronet.<sup><a href="#n0832" id="r3">3</a></sup> I gave him a copy of Leaves of Grass in 1874, &amp; he knows a great portion of it now
      by heart. Though still so young, he has developed a considerable faculty for writing
      &amp; is an enthusiastic student 
      
      
      of literature as well as a frank vigorous lively young fellow. I thought you might
      like to see how some of the youth of England is being drawn toward you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Believe me always sincerely &amp; affectionately yours
      <br></br>J. A. Symonds.

   <p>St. Loe writes so bad a hand that I shall transcribe his verses for him</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <h4 class="indent">I</h4>
   <p>Thine is no Carol of weak love or hate;<br>Thine is no Song by listless idler Sung;<br>No poor attempt to cheat us from our fate;<br>No shallow words from shallower fancies wrung.<br>These are not thine; thy music pure is flung<br>From out a heart that throbs &amp; pants, which aches<br>With its great love: our Suffering role among<br>Thou com'st with thy great gift of song that makes<br>All things seem bright &amp; clear,<br>all lovelier vision wakes.
   </p>
   
   <br><h4 class="indent">II</h4>
   <p>Though now the world is deaf &amp; will not hear,<br>Though now the foolish rail &amp; sneer at thee<br>It matters not: their frowns thou dost not fear<br>Thou know'st the day will come the [illegible]<br>When thou in love with Him of Galilee<br>Shalt have thy place. Not yet, The years must wane,<br>And thought from Superstition's curse be free:<br>When this is ended, thou with him shalt reign<br>[
      <span class="unclear">Strong?</span>]
       in all hearts, as loved, as<br>mighty brothers twain.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04208_n1">1. John Addington Symonds, a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was in his
      time most famous as the author of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>. But in the smaller circles of the emerging
      upper-class English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of
      homoerotic poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual
      inversion as it was then known (<em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 701).<a href="#r1">[back]
