      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Do not think me too wilful or headstrong but I have taken our tickets &amp; we shall
      sail Aug 30, for Philadelphia. I found if I did not come to a decision now, we could
      not well arrange it before next summer. And since we <u>have</u>
      come to a decision  my mind has been quite
      at rest. Do not feel any anxiety or misgivings about us. I have a clear and strong
      conviction I am doing what is right &amp; best for us all.—After a busy
      anxious time I am having a week or two, rest with Percy, who I find fairly well in health &amp; prospering in his
      business—indeed he bids fair to have a large private practice as an analyst
       here, &amp; is
      already making income enough to marry on only there is to build the nest—&amp;
      I think he will have actually to <u>build</u> it, for there seem
      no eligible houses— &amp; to furnish that the wedding will not be till next
      spring or early summer—nevertheless with a definite goal &amp; a definite time
      &amp; the way between not so very rugged though rather dull &amp; lonely I think he
      will be pretty cheery. 
      This little town (of 11000 inhabitants all miners, smelters &amp;c.) lies up among
      the hill 1100 ft above the sea—glorious hills here spreading then converging,
      with wooded flanks &amp; swift brooklets leaping over stones in the
      hollows—the air too of course deliciously light &amp; pure.—I have heard
      through a friend of ours of Bee's fellow
      students who lives in Camden (Mr. Suerkrop  I
      think his name is) that we shall  be able to get a very comfortable home with pleasant garden there
      for about £55 per an: I think I can manage that very well—so all I need
      is to hear of a comfortable lodging or boarding house (the former preferred,) where
      we can be, avoiding hotel even while we hunt for the house. I have arranged for my
      goods to sail a week 
      later than we do, so as to give us time. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
