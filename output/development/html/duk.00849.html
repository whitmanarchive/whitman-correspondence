   <p>Yours of 11th just rec'd<sup><a href="#duk.00849_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup>—it is a fine bright morning, just the right
      temperature—I am feeling better to-day—freer (almost free) of the heavy
      congested condition (especially the head department) that has been upon me for
      nearly a week—Took a long drive yesterday &amp; have been living much on
      strawberries of late—Don't write much—just sold &amp; got the money
      for—&amp; it comes in good, I tell you—a poem to <em>Lippincotts</em>—(Mr Walsh<sup><a href="#loc.04628_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> editor—friendly to me)—poem called
      "November Boughs," a cluster of sonnet-like bits, making one piece, in shape like
      "Fancies at Navesink"—that ("November Boughs") is the name, by the by, I think
      of giving my little book, I want to have out before '87 closes—shall probably
      print it here in Phila: myself—it will merely give the pieces I have uttered the last
      five
      years, in correct form, more permanent in book shape—probably nothing
      new—I see a piece in Saturday's June 11 N Y <em>Times</em><sup><a href="#duk.00849_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      that Boyle O'Reilly<sup><a href="#n4973" id="r5">5</a></sup> is treasurer of my <em>summer
         cottage fund</em>—(dear Boyle, if you see him say I sent my best love
      &amp; thanks)—I wish you fellows, Baxter<sup><a href="#n6000" id="r6">6</a></sup>, Mrs
      F[airchild]<sup><a href="#duk.00843_n2" id="r7">7</a></sup>, yourself &amp;c, to leave the selection, arrangement, disposal &amp;c
      of the cottage, (where, how, &amp;c) <em>to me</em>—the whole
      thing is something I am making much reckoning of—more probably than you all
      are aware—the am't shall be put of course to that definite single purpose,
      &amp; <em>there</em> I shall probably mainly live the rest of my
      days—O how I want to get amid good air—the air is so tainted here, five
      or six months in the year, at best<sup><a href="#duk.00849_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup>—As I write
      Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r9">9</a></sup> is here sketching in my portrait for an oil
      painting—I hear from Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r10">10</a></sup> often—nothing now of
      late from O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r11">11</a></sup>, who is still in So: Cal—My friend Pearsall Smith<sup><a href="#n4979" id="r12">12</a></sup> &amp; his daughter sailed for England in the Eider last
      Saturday—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

      order to sabotage it. He was arrested and sentenced to be hanged in 1866. Later
      the decree was altered, and O'Reilly was sent to Australia, where he escaped on
      an American whaler in 1869. In 1876 he became the coeditor of the Boston <em>Pilot</em>, a position which he held until his death in 1890.

      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="n0119">10. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n4979">12. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
