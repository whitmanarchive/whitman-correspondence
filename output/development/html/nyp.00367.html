      This postcard bears the address, "Pete Doyle, | M st. South—bet 4½
      &amp; 6th | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | May | 7 | N.J.;
      Carrier | 8 | May | 8 AM."<br><br>
      The correspondence (again chiefly postcards) with Doyle in April and May was
      sent on Fridays, according to Whitman's habit. At this time Doyle was
      working out of Baltimore; note Whitman's , and  letters to
      Doyle.<a href="#r1">[back]
