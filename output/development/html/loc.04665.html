      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I went round last evening to call on Mrs Rogers,<sup><a href="#loc.04665_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; thought perhaps I might find
      you there, but the house was shut up &amp; nobody home—the lady opposite told
      me Mrs R was down to Bridgeton to her brother's—told me Jane was up Thursday
      or Friday to get some things—Jane said Mrs R was getting along pretty well,
      &amp; 
      w'd
      
       be home in Camden very shortly.
   </p>
   
   <p>—And how are you? &amp; <u>how's all</u>? (as they say down south) I got a long nice
      letter from Harry yesterday—he is well &amp; hearty &amp; seems to be having
      good times—I shall write to him to-day—Well the work on my new book "Specimen
      Days" is finished, &amp; I feel as if a troublesome job was off my hands
      
      The enclosed adv't will give you some idea of it<sup><a href="#loc.04665_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—a great part of it was written
      down at the pond, the first three summers '76, '77 and '78 I was down there at your
      house—We could not get my
      brother Eddy boarded at the place I 
      wish'd—he is out temporarily at a place a
      few miles from Philadelphia—
   </p>
   
   <p>(While I am writing this it is a very pleasant quiet Sunday—as I sit here by my
      open window, a lady nearly opposite is playing on the piano and singing some good
      old hymns—"Old Hundred" and
      such—Keeps it up a long while—sounds first rate.)—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am well as usual—Keep
      about on the same old round here day after
      day—read or write two or three hours, &amp; then go out &amp; over
      the ferry to Philadelphia—I don't know what I should do without the ferry,
      &amp; river, &amp; crossing, day &amp; night—I believe my best times are
      nights—sometimes appear to have the river &amp; boat all to myself—
