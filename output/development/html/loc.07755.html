   <p>A rare egg &amp; Graham br'd for my breakfast—Y'r good letter rec'd<sup><a href="#loc.07755_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—the sun is out after clouding for several
      days—I shall get out a little in wheel-chair (I got out even
      yesterday)—am <em>moved</em> (as the Quakers say) to write some
      poemetta these days—partly small orders, &amp; part to please myself.

   <p>This cold or gathering in the head, &amp; the bladder trouble continued, sometimes
      quite bad, sometimes less bad—massages unintermitted—appetite,
      night-rest &amp; bowel action fair to fairish, wh' I am thankful for as it is, as no
      worse—Some of the fellows hereabout notice that the departing grippe leaves an
      eye bother, or liability—&amp; there probably is something in that—I
      have mark'd defection &amp; weakness in my own eyesight (but something of it
      before)—nothing serious yet—Shall try to send you any new thing I give
      out printed these days without fail, prose or verse—Enclosed the "Cipher" bit,
      also another slip of "Old Ages Ship"<sup><a href="#loc.07755_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Suppose you
      rec'd the "Death Bouquets" ¶'s<sup><a href="#loc.07753_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> (bad typo errors in it)—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07755_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden (?) |
      Feb (?) | 6 AM | 90.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.07755_n2">2. Whitman is likely referring

   <p id="loc.07755_n3">3. Whitman is referring to
      the poem "," which appeared in the 4 October 1887 issue
      of <em>The Cosmopolitan</em>. He also refers to a corrected proof
      of "," which appeared in the February
      issue of the <em>Century</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.07753_n3">4. "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf250r1">A Death-Bouquet</a>" became the last section of <em>Good-Bye My Fancy</em>, which was later reprinted in <em>Complete Prose Works</em> (1892). Though Whitman notes its appearance in
      the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in this letter, Floyd Stovall
      claims not to have found it there in his edition of the <em>Prose
         Works 1892</em>. See <em>The Collected Writings of Walt
