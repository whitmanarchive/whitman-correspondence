   <p>I have gone over the chapters—got quite in the spirit of them—added &amp; suggested a
      few lines or words here &amp; there—and <em>pruned</em> a few passages, even pages, remorselessly.<sup><a href="#uva.00383_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I like them all—they are very <em>living</em>—the "Beauty" chapter I think especially fine.<sup><a href="#uva.00383_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Do you say the final chapter is already in print? the one about me? If so, <em>send me the proof</em>, which I will return by next mail. I am feeling quite well for me.
