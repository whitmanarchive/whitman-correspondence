      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have your card of 9th,<sup><a href="#loc.07207_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I am very glad to hear that
      there is a chance of Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> coming this way,<sup><a href="#loc.07207_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> please tell him so. You have evidently made up your
      mind not to go to England and you are wise to have done so. Mr &amp; Miss Smith<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> I suppose sailed yesterday. I am glad to hear of the
      advent of the little girl Rachel<sup><a href="#n3137" id="r5">5</a></sup>. Wish they would get something
      settled (one way or the other) about that seaside cottage<sup><a href="#prc.00121_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup>— 
      if that scheme is not
      carried out you had better come here yet, you really must not remain in Camden all
      Summer—I do wish it was settled that you were to leave there soon and where
      you were going, it must be getting very warm with you—here it is cool and
      pleasant—no end of grass and trees  (you would not know the place the trees
      have grown so since 1880). I am very anxious to see "Specimen Days in Am" and do not
      understand why I have not a copy by this time, Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r7">7</a></sup> was
      to send me one as soon as the book was out—but if you have a copy to share by
      all means send me one as you propose. I am more and more pleased with the last
      photo. think it is grand. So J. N. Johnson<sup><a href="#n0914" id="r8">8</a></sup> is still in your
      neighborhood. You do not say whether he is coming further North, I fear not, but
      please tell him (if you have not already) that I should like much to have a visit
      from him if the thing is at all on the cards. I hope you will be feeling better by
      the time you get this but I doubt if you get much better until you get out of
      Camden, a change of air would do you more good now than any thing. We are prepared
      to make you comfortable (if the thing is possible) if you will come to us. I send
      you my love and am always affectionately yours
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0262">2. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <p id="loc.07207_n2">3. Herbert Gilchrist arrived in
      Camden on June 3, 1887. It does not appear that Gilchrist visited Bucke in the
      summer of 1887.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">4. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="prc.00121_n3">6. Boston friends were
      raising money to buy a summer cottage they hoped would improve Whitman's failing
      health. Whitman eventually used the money to build his extravagant mausoleum in
      Harleigh Cemetery—to the shock and dismay of those who had worked hardest
      to solicit money.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="loc.03310_n1">7. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <p id="n0914">8. John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.<a href="#r8">[back]
