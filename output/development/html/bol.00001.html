   <p id="bol.00001_n1">2. Elizabeth Ford wrote to
      Whitman on : "Your words that you
      have written are such a strength, it is so wonderful to find said, things that
      hover in one. I mean, to read things that one's heart cries out in answer to.
      This is what makes me so that I cannot help writing to you." Her picture,
      inscribed June 20, 1877, is in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection, Library of
      Congress, Washington D.C. Whitman sent <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and <em>Specimen Days</em> to Isabella on October 11, 1882, and to
      Elizabeth on June 27, 1883 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). For Pease, see the
