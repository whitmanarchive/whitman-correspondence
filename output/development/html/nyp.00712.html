      A pleasant day out &amp; I am feeling better than for two weeks 
      past—Drove down yesterday three or four miles to Gloucester, on the 
      Delaware below here, to a fine old public house close to the river, where I
      had four hours &amp; a good dinner of <em>planked shad</em> &amp; champagne<sup><a href="#nyp.00712_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—had a 
      good view of the picturesque sight of the great boat, 20 black men rowing 
      rhythmically, paying out the big seine—making a circuit in the river, 
      (here quite a bay)—enjoyed all &amp; was driven back to Camden ab't 
      sundown—So you see I get out &amp; have fun yet—but it is a dwindling business—
   </p>

      I enclose an old note from Kennedy.<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r3">3</a></sup> Mrs Louise C Moulton<sup><a href="#n4264" id="r4">4</a></sup> was here 
      day before yesterday—two English travelers a couple of hours later—Did 
      I acknowledge &amp; thank you for your good letter of a week ago?—Last 
      evn'g came a little eng: from one of J.F. Millet's<sup><a href="#n4256" id="r5">5</a></sup> pictures—a present from 
      Felix Adler<sup><a href="#nyp.00712_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> of N Y—Best love &amp; remembrances to you both—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00712_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd May 16/88." It is addressed: Wm D. O'Connor | 1015 O Street | Washington
      | D.C. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | Apr 25 | 4 30 PM | 88; Washington, Rec'd

   <p id="nyp.00712_n2">2. William J. "Billy" Thompson
      (1848–1911), known as "The Duke of Gloucester" and "The Statesman," was a
      friend of Whitman's who operated a hotel, race track, and amusement park on the
      beach overlooking the Delaware River at Gloucester, New Jersey. His shad and
      champagne dinners for Whitman were something of a tradition. See William Sloane
      Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> (1896),
      15–16.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">3. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="n4264">4. Louise Chandler Moulton
      (1835–1908) was an American poet and critic who published several
      collections of verse and prose, as well as regular contributions to the <em>New York Tribune</em> and <em>Boston
         Herald.</em>

   <p id="n4256">5. Jean-François Millet
      (1814–1875) was a French Realist painter and founder of the Barbizon
      School. He is noted for his depictions of peasant farmers.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00712_n3">6. Felix Adler
      (1851–1933) was a German American professor of political and social
      ethics. During his tenure at Cornell University and later Columbia, he founded
      the New York Society of Ethical Culture (1877) and the National Child Labor
      Committee (1904). His philosophy sought to unite theists, atheists, agnostics,
      and deists under the same moral social actions, and argued that morality should
      be considered independently from religion. For more on Adler, see Horace Friess,
      <em>Felix Adler and Ethical Culture: Memories and
         Studies</em>, ed. Fannia Weingartner (New York: Columbia University Press,
      1981). See also Adler's and Whitman's conversation at a dinner on April 1, 1888,
      when Whitman told Adler that the poems in Leaves of Grass "are really only
      Millet in another form—they are the Millet that Walt Whitman has succeeded in
      putting into words" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.4.html">April 1, 1888</a>).<a href="#r6">[back]
