   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00591_n1">1. This letter dates to April
      5, 1870. The calendar date April 5 is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and
      the letter dates to the year of Jesse Whitman's death. Richard Maurice Bucke's
      month is obscured by a water stain, but his calendar date "5" and year "70" are
      near certain because he could rely on Louisa's date and Jesse Whitman's death.
      Edwin Haviland Miller cited Bucke's year (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:368).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00591_n9">2. Walt Whitman's April 4, 1870
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:362).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n11">3. Helen Price was the
      daughter of Abby and Edmund Price. Abby Price and her family, especially her
      daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman and his mother, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman. Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform
      movements. Price's husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and
      the couple had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in
      1852, at 2 years of age). In 1860, the Price family began to save Walt's
      letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman were included in Richard Maurice
      Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1883), and she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters to
      her mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00591_n7">5. The late-March or
      early-April letter from Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant. Mattie, in her March 30, 1870 letter to
      Walt Whitman, had indicated her intent to "write to Mother." In that letter,
      Mattie reported that Louisa had "promised" to visit her and the children in St.
      Louis (see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of
         Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977],
      70–71). But Mattie did not report her husband Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman's plan to visit his mother during his trip to Pittsburgh (see below).
      Mattie and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie
      and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867
      to assume the position of Superintendent of Water Works. For more on Mattie, see
      Waldron, 1–26.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00591_n14">7. Jeff Whitman visited his
      mother in Brooklyn the following week (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00591_n6">8. Jesse Whitman
      (1818–1870), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's eldest son, died at Kings County
      Lunatic Asylum on March 21, 1870. Jesse had suffered from mental illness that
      included threats of violence for several years before he was committed to the
      asylum. Walt Whitman was notified of his brother's death (see E. Warner's  letter to Walt). For a short
      biography of Jesse Whitman, see Robert Roper, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.01011.pdf">"Jesse Whitman, Seafarer,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 26:1 (Summer 2008),
      35–41.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00591_n8">9. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      had expressed the same hope, that she could learn more detail, immediately after
      she was notified of Jesse Whitman's death (see her  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00467_n1">10. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00591_n13">11. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
