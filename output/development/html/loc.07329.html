   <p>Yours of 18, 20, 21<sup><a href="#loc.07329_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> enclosing letters from Rhys<sup><a href="#n4152" id="r3">3</a></sup> and
      Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r4">4</a></sup> came to hand this afternoon<sup><a href="#loc.07329_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> and was
      welcomed as usual. I rather envy Rhys meeting Henry Harland<sup><a href="#loc.07329_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup>—H.H. is a man I have considerable admiration of
      and I sh<u>d</u> like well to meet him. I am well pleased that you like your present
      muse<sup><a href="#loc.07319_n6" id="r7">7</a></sup> so well and hope he will stick to you and to
      the massage business which is the great thing for you. Eldridge<sup><a href="#n0210" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      (I suppose your old publisher of 1860—29 years ago!) must be a pretty old
      fellow to be getting married? But they say "there is no fool like an old fool!" He
      probably knows his own business best, any how! Is the "Harleigh Cemetery"<sup><a href="#loc.07329_n5" id="r9">9</a></sup> which you
      mention that one which we used to pass driving out to the Staffords<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n3" id="r10">10</a></sup>? If so it must be a pleasant place—well laid out
      and planted by now.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well Xmas is round again! I can hardly believe it. There is no time of the year I
      like to <u>get over</u> so well as Xmas and New Years—thank
      goodness this week and next will fix them! I have some writing to do if I could only
      get at it but there is so much turning up all the time (all requiring to be looked
      after) that I almost despair of doing anything. Should the meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r11">11</a></sup> turn out O.K. I
      wonder if a poor devil would have more time or less? Well we must scratch along best
      we can while we are here. I wonder how it will be on our next stage? Shall we still
      have to toil and moil, work and fight as here? or will the Lord give us a rest?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4152">3. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">4. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="loc.07329_n2">6. Henry Harland
      (1861–1905) was the American novelist and co-editor with Aubrey Beardsley of <em>The Yellow Book</em>, a British quarterly literary magazine
      (1894-1897). Bucke's admiration must be understood in terms of Harland's early
      novels, such as <em>A Jewish Musician's Story</em> (1885), a local
      color description of German Jews in Manhattan.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07319_n6">7. Frank Warren Fritzinger
      (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
      nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
      of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a blind sea captain, and
      Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and his
      brother–having lost both parents–became wards of Mary O. Davis,
      Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
      inherited part of his estate. <a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0210">8. Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07329_n5">9. Whitman was buried in Harleigh Cemetery in 
      Camden, New Jersey, on March 30, 1892 in an elaborate granite tomb that he designed.
      Reinhalter
      and Company of Philadelphia built the tomb, at a cost of $4,000. Whitman covered a
      portion
      of these costs with money that his Boston friends had raised so that the poet could
      purchase a summer cottage; the remaining balance was paid by Whitman's literary executor,
      Thomas Harned.
      For more information on the cemetery and Whitman's tomb, see See

   <p id="loc.02189_n3">10. Susan and George Stafford
      were the parents of Whitman's young friend, Harry Stafford. Whitman often
      visited the family at their farm at Timber Creek in Laurel Springs (near
      Glendale), New Jersey, and was sometimes accompanied by Herbert Gilchrist; in
      the 1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby Glendale. For more,
