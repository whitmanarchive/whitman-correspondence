   <p>Well, dear Walt, here I am safely settled down at home again and Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r2">2</a></sup> is here with me<sup><a href="#loc.07120_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I wish he could stay for a good visit but
      I believe he will have to leave us in a very few days. I have been at work all this
      morning getting ready my first lecture on insanity for the students; which lecture
      I
      deliver tomorrow after-
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>noon—2 to 4—</p>
   
   
   <p>We got home, as I guess you know, friday evening about 7 o'clock—All yesterday
      I was very busy looking into matters which had accumulated in my absence and today,
      as I have said, about my lecture. Tomorrow morning Clare<sup><a href="#loc.07284_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      leaves home for Chicago and the west—she will visit in Indiana and, I think,
      Tennesee before she returns home.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Horace &amp; I shall expect to hear from you tomorrow—Horace, I think, is quite
      anxious about being away from you so long. I found Mrs Bucke<sup><a href="#n4273" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      and all the children quite well on my return and Horace will tell you all about them
      when he sees you. Horace is quite struck with Pardee<sup><a href="#loc.07347_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup> (your old
      favorite) and thinks him a splended boy—as indeed he is.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>It is cold today and dark and windy as well; we shall soon be having snow and real
      wintry weather here. I have been showing Horace something of my W.W. collection and
      H. is to take some copies of L. of G. (old eds.) back with him to have you put your
      name in them.—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
