   <p>Your card came to me on the night of the 13th. I was agreeable surprised to think
      that you had not forgotten me as I shall never forget you as long as I live. My father
      &amp; mother is still living in Bridge-ville&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      But myself &amp; my little Family live near the capital of this state. I am married &amp;
      have one Child&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I will be 3 years married in March. I am about as well as I could expect to be under
      circumstances. You cant begin to think how proud I felt when I got your card.
   </p>
   
   <p>If you can make it convient I would like for you to pay us a visit in May, as we will be better fixed then to
      accomodate you then we are at present.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William H. Millis Jr. was the son of William H.
      Millis Sr., who corresponded with Whitman during the war about the condition of
      his wounded son (see Millis Sr.'s 
      letter to Whitman). Whitman described Millis Jr., upon first meeting: "Wm H
      Millis co E 8th Penn Cav. Gen Gregg's old reg. Bridgeville Sussex co Del bed 33
      Ward B May 8th '64 / g s w in Chestâ€”w in left arm father living in Bridgeville
      Del" (<em>NUPM</em> 2:728). Millis Jr. first wrote to Whitman on
      , thanking him for his letter
      (not extant) and proclaiming, "May god bless you forever I cant find words to
      tell you the love thier is in me for you. I hope you &amp; I may live to meet
      again on this earth if not I hope we shall meet in the world w[h]ere there is no
      more parting."
