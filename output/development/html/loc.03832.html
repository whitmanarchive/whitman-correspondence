   <p>Thanks for your dear kind note of last week—I have been quite ill—the
      doctor says mainly a lesion or trouble, (physical) brain centre, other botherations
      too—but as I write this towards evening I have the very definite feeling of
      the worst having passed, &amp; that I shall be better in a day or two—I feel
      so to-day already—&amp; soon about as usual—
   </p>
   
   <p>No my friend there is nothing you can specially do for me (I should frankly tell
      you, if there was.) Mary's and Logan's visit Sunday through the storm was a real
      comfort to me—(more a help than they knew.) I wish dear Alys would take  the earliest
      convenient opportunity to give my excuses &amp; love to Mr and Mrs: Williams, and
      Churchy<sup><a href="#loc.03832_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I have had this trouble on me now for
      over three weeks—
   </p>
   
   <p>It is very lonesome here—If I had not been born with a happy-tending natural
      disposition (I inherit it from my mother) the last few weeks—yes the last ten
      years—would have been unmitigated darkness &amp; heaviness to me—As it
      is, the ennuyeed hours have been the rare exceptions—
   </p>
   
   <p>Then about the shows of life &amp; my experience in them I am deeper &amp; deeper
      impressed the older I grow that
   </p>
   
   <p><u>the</u>
      <u>real</u>
      <u>something</u>
      <u>has</u>
      <u>yet</u>
      <u>to be</u>
      <u>known</u>—
   </p>
   
   <p>It is well I am physically ballasted so strong, with weightiest animality &amp;
      appetites, or I should go off in a balloon—Well luckily for you my friend I
      have come to the end of the paper—
   </p>
