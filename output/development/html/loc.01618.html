      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I have just returned from a long tour in Germany &amp; France
      &amp; find a pamphlet of yours awaiting me Sent I
      hope &amp; presume by you—I say <u>I hope</u> for there is
      no line accompanying it and yet I think it is your writing on the cover If you have sent it him
      am I not forgotten.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have often wished I may say Even longed to hear from you—a few a very few
      lines to tell me of your well being a little of your doings and of your recollection
      (if it is not too much to ask) of one who is always yr sincere friend &amp; lover
      &amp; who travelled many a mile to see &amp; speak with you.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I even hoped against hope that you would brighten us perhaps
      in England this summer, but it passed
      and neither you nor word of you came through
      a time
      and oft as steamer after steamer arrived I wondered, does he come or
      write?—Enough—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mark you: if to you I am indebted for the pamphlet I like it much. it strikes me as
      so simple, pure &amp; powerful, &amp; reminds me as so much of your work does of all that
      is sweet &amp; good &amp; noble in the world Somehow when I read you or think of
      you, I feel once more the cool never to be forgotten breeze of a boundless prairie;
      my lungs seem to open and I respire more freely I feel perhaps freer for the time
      &amp; less material &amp; then again I feel that I hold in my hand clasped strong
      &amp; tight &amp; for eternity the great hand of a friend—a simple good fellow
      a man  who loves me
      &amp; who is beautiful because he loves, &amp; with the consciousness of that I feel
      never alone—never sad—&amp; much more, I feel but to what purpose do I
      write thus—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will tell you a little of what I have seen but it must be very little as I only
      returned late last night after a long journey &amp; find much to occupy me. Paris,
      the gay, the beautiful is no longer either. It is terribly sad &amp; horribly ugly.
      Great wounds as it were over the face of it—ruins at every corner streets
      blackened with petroleum. Shop window after shop window in the most busy &amp;
      flourishing quarters still smashed &amp; unmended patched up with paper houses torn
      by shells—and the people in the streets &amp; in the boulevards  no longer the
      Parisians of old but a sadder may we hope a wiser people.
   </p>
   
   <p>So many thousands are in deep mourning that this gives as it were a funeral touch
      to
      it all.
   </p>
   
   <p>Then the Palace of St. Cloud is a skeleton, not a window, not a bit of roof, is left
      of it. The old Tuileries too look fearful—with their picturesque walls &amp;
      in the distance The grand almost sublime ruins of the Hotel de Ville look
      reproachfully upon 
      you—to me Paris was very saddening—still
      more Metz &amp; Strasbourg1 which are alike what the French call
      abimé—literally razed Even unto the ground—the soldiers all that
      remain of them look small, ill-fed, ill-clothed, and are I heard
      over-drilled—In Strasbourg a Prussian band plays magnificently Every day at a
      certain  but as yet no one has been seen to
      stand &amp; listen to it—hatred is no word for the feeling between them.
   </p>
   
   <p>The Prussian soldiers are really splendid fellows I think you would very much like
      them, they are so manly &amp; simple perhaps too warlike but that is of course the
      fault of their Education for their temperament is it seems to me very domestic &amp;
      affectionate.
   </p>
   
   <p>Blind as Frenchmen always are to their own faults Parisians seem to be dimly conscious that it was
      Paris much more than France that forced the Emperor by its mad clamor to undertake
      the war which has ruined both the Emperor and the Capital.
   </p>
   
   <p>I will write again when I hear from you</p>
   
   <p>In the meantime I remain dear Mr. Whitman</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Cyril Flower (1843–1907) was an English
      barrister and a friend of Tennyson; see Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt
         Whitman in England</em> (1934), 128–129. According to the February 20,
      1886 <em>Solicitor's Journal</em>, Flower was appointed a Lord of
      the Treasury; Flower served as a member of Parliament from 1880 to 1892, when he
      was given the title Baron Battersea (see the London <em>Gazette</em> (6 September 1892), 5090). According to Flower's  letter, he met Whitman in Washington
      in December, 1870. He had later delivered some of Whitman's books to Tennyson,
      who "was much touched by your memory of him, and I told him of your deep regard
      for him." On , Flower informed
      Whitman that Tennyson was sending a letter by the same mail (Tennyson's letter
      was dated ). Flower wrote again on
      : "When I read you or think of
      you . . . I feel that I hold in my hand clasped strong &amp; tight &amp; for
      security the great hand of a friend, a simple good fellow, a man who loves me
      &amp; who is beautiful because he loves, &amp; with the consciousness of that I
      feel never alone—never sad."
