   <p> Dear Sir—Though I made a fruitless attempt, some two years since to
      communicate with you about a work to be published, relating to the <u>Whitman</u>
      Geneology, in which I thought you might take an interest, as perhaps of the same
      family &amp; like to add what you might know of your names,—I am about to
      make another effort &amp; enclose you what has just been furnished me by Mr Farnam,<sup><a href="#loc.04856_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> who I
      know would be glad to hear from <u>you</u>, for <u>you</u>, as many others of the name, are not unknown to
      fame.<sup><a href="#loc.04856_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p> I am not a Whitman myself but a daughter-in-law of the late 
       Judge
      Whitman—a model of the old school gentleman &amp; scholar. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I frequently read with interest little notices of yourself &amp; your doings &amp; as I hope
      an improvement in your health—the aid to your locomotion as the gift of friends
      &amp;c. 
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With kind wishes &amp; respect
      <br></br>Yours
      <br></br>Mrs Lavinia F. Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <br><p></span><span class="handshift">To all persons bearing the name of</p>
   <br><p></span><span class="handshift">WHITMAN.</p>
   ———
   
   
   <p>
      </span><span class="handshift">The great majority of those bearing the name of Whitman in the United
      States are descended from John Whitman, who settled in Weymouth, Mass.,
      about 1640, and from his sons Thomas, John, Abiah and Zechariah. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      </span><span class="handshift">The record of the family to the fourth generation was prepared by Hon.
      Judge Whitman, late of Portland, and for many years Chief Justice of Maine.
      It is the endeavor of the writer of this circular to trace out from that
      time the various branches, and thus continue the record to date. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      </span><span class="handshift">If the work is to be well done, it is important that copies of old Bible
      records, Tombstone inscriptions, family traditions and other matters of
      interest should be collected and placed in proper hands for preservation and
      comparison. I therefore particularly request all sons and daughters of all the Whitmans
      to transmit to me such particulars of their own families, and of their ancestors'
      families, for two, 
      three or four generations back, as they can find or obtain, stating, if possible places
      of
      residence, occupation, etc., and especially copies of records of births,
      marriages and deaths. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      </span><span class="handshift">It will be thus possible to refer any correspondents to their ancient
      stock and name their ancestors. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      </span><span class="handshift">I trust that all will have sufficient interest in the work to spare at
      least the time to prepare their own record, and will give the matter their
      immediate attention.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Lavinia Fanning Watson Whitman
      (1818–1900) was the eldest daughter of John Fanning Watson—author of
      <em>Annals of Philadelphia</em> (1830) and a well known
      historian of Philadelphia and New York City—and his wife Phebe Barron
      Crowell. In 1846, Lavinia became the first woman to sponsor a United States Navy
      ship when she christened the sloop-of-war, the <em>USS
         Germantown</em> in Philadelphia. She married Harrison Gray Otis Whitman, a
      son of Chief Justice Ezekial Whitman of Maine.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04856_n2">1. Charles Henry Farnham
      (1846–1909) was an archaeologist and author from New Haven, Connecticut.
      He attended Yale and went on to serve as the Assistant in Archæology in the
      Peabody Museum at the university from 1877 to 1891. He researched Whitman
      genealogy for several years before publishing <em>The History of
         the Descendants of John Whitman of Weymouth, Mass.</em> in 1889. He would
      have been gathering material for this volume at the time Lavinia Whitman sent
      his request for genealogical information to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.04856_n1">2. Any prior letters are not
