      <em>indeed thank you</em>. It is the biggest stroke of pure
      kindness &amp; concrete help I have ever rec'd—But all formal letters must
      just fizzle down to this card—whose duplicate I send to T W—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Donaldson
      (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
      introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
      the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
      carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt
         Whitman, the Man</em> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see
