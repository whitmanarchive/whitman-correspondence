   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

   <p id="loc.03310_n1">2. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <p id="n0914">3. John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00852_n2">4. Whitman is referring to
      George Sand's romantic novel <em>Consuelo</em> (1842). See Esther

      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <p id="n0862">6. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
