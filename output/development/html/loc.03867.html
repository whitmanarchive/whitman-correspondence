   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03867_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Mrs: Susan Stafford | Kirkwood | (Glendale) | New Jersey. It is postmarked:
      Camden, N.J. | Aug 22 | 8 PM | 88. There is a second postmark, but it is
      illegible.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6148">2. Eva (Westcott) was the wife of Harry Stafford. Here,
      Whitman is likely referring to the couple's first child, Dora.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6149">3. Harry Stafford (b. 1858) was eighteen when he met
      Whitman. The two began a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked by
      early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00084_n3">4. Herbert Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), the artist-son of Anne Gilchrist, was a frequent visitor with
      Whitman to the Stafford farm. For more on him, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, ed.,
      (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00571_n5">5. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), Walt's youngest brother, was mentally and physically
      handicapped.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03867_n3">6. On August 1, 1888, Whitman's
      mother Louisa and his niece Jessie placed Edward in the Insane Asylum at
      Blackwoodtown, New Jersey. The poet continued to pay his brother's expenses. On
      September 4, Mrs. Davis and Warren Fritzinger went to see Eddy: "He seems to be
      all right &amp; as happy as is to be expected" (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r6">[back]
