      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mama,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will write you a line, to begin my letter, before I leave the office—I have been
      sitting here alone for a couple of hours, having a good time, all by myself, nobody
      in the building besides me, but the watchman—Mama dear, I suppose you got the order
      in my last—I have also sent you the old Franklin Almanac—write if it arrived safe.
      There is nothing new or special—I am well, &amp; only hope your cold is better—I sometimes
      think a bad cold is about as aggravating as any thing one can have—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I saw Grant to-day on the avenue walking by himself—(I always salute him, &amp; he does
      the same to me.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>Friday forenoon ½ past 11</em></p>
   
   
   <p>I have been hard at work all the forenoon—it is a cloudy day here, threatening rain—Mama
      dear, I don't seem to think of any thing to write about this morning—Love to you—&amp;
      to George &amp; Lou if they are there.
   </p>

      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I send you a couple of Washington papers.</p>
