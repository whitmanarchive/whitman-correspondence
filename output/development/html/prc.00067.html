   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00067_n1">1. This letter bears the
      following address: C H Sholes | Glenwood | Mills Co: Iowa. It is postmarked:
      Philadelphia PA | Mar | 12 | 5 PM. C. H. Sholes was a shorthand reporter in
      Iowa. On Decoration Day, May 30, 1880, he published an article entitled "Ashes
      of Soldiers" in the <em>Iowa State Register</em>, commending
      Whitman for his service during the Civil War. See Ted Genoways, "'Ashes of
      Soldiers': Walt Whitman and C. H. Sholes, a New Letter and a Newspaper Article,"
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 18 (Spring 2001),
      186–187.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00067_n2">2. Sholes received the
      package—an 1876 edition of <em>Two Rivulets</em> was offered
      for sale in the early 2000s by D &amp; D Galleries of Somerville, New Jersey,
      with the inscription: "C. H. Sholes | from the author"—but if he sent a
      postcard confirming the shipment, Whitman did not note it in the
      daybooks.<a href="#r2">[back]
