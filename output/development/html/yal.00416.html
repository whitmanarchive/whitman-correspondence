   <p>I have just rec'd your short letter of yesterday<sup><a href="#yal.00416_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Mother, I feel so bad, you are not well, I don't know what to do—will not rest, and
      some food that suits, be good remedies? An old person wants the most favorable conditions,
      
      to get over any thing. Mother, I will come on about the 1st of next month—I am getting
      along favorably, they all say, but have frequent distress in my head, 
      &amp; my leg is clumsy as ever—I am writing this in the office at my desk—I send some
      papers to-day<sup><a href="#yal.00416_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—nothing particular in them—but I think the English paper, 
      the <em>Sunderland Times</em>, good reading—Mother, write, if perfectly convenient, 
      either Friday or Saturday, as I am anxious about you—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
