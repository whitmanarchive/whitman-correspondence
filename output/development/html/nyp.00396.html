   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William H. Millis Jr. was the son of William H.
      Millis Sr., who corresponded with Whitman during the war about the condition of
      his wounded son (see Millis Sr.'s 
      letter to Whitman). Whitman described Millis Jr., upon first meeting: "Wm H
      Millis co E 8th Penn Cav. Gen Gregg's old reg. Bridgeville Sussex co Del bed 33
      Ward B May 8th '64 / g s w in Chestâ€”w in left arm father living in Bridgeville
      Del" (<em>NUPM</em> 2:728). Millis Jr. first wrote to Whitman on
      , thanking him for his letter
      (not extant) and proclaiming, "May god bless you forever I cant find words to
      tell you the love thier is in me for you. I hope you &amp; I may live to meet
      again on this earth if not I hope we shall meet in the world w[h]ere there is no
      more parting."
