   </p>
   
   
   <p>Last Spring I happened upon a nest of poets at Avignon<sup><a href="#n0871" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Provençal poets—successors of the old troubadours—among them [
      <span class="unclear">Mssr?</span>]
       Charles Bonaparte Wyse, a descendant of Lucien Bonaparte &amp; the son of an Irishman.<sup><a href="#n3009" id="r2">2</a></sup> He went to the South of France, from Ireland, some 25 years ago &amp; was so charmed
      with the poets there that he learned the Provençal language &amp; became one
      
      
      of them. He spends a part of every year there. He is a gentleman, a scholar, &amp; a poet;
      also a good judge of poetry. Well, he is one of your warmest friends &amp; appreciators—and
      has sent by me all sorts of messages to you. As I am not to return till the Spring
      I send them by mail. Last April we dined with him at the inn of "La Chevelure d'Or,"
      at the ancient, ruined &amp; almost deserted city of Les Baux, In the top of a mountain
      near Arles. This inn, by the way, was named by Mr. Wyse after
      
      
      
      a magnificent head of golden hair found in an old tomb at Les Baux, which he has made
      the subject of a Provençal poem, &amp; which was in the possesion of the landlord. At
      this dinner Mr. Wyse proposed, &amp; we all drank, standing, the health of Walt Whitman.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just received a letter from my friend in which he says:</p>
   
   
   <p>"I enclose you my promised Provençal translation of two of the sweetest bits of Manahatta's
      poetry. I have not attempted his poetic prose, which is not to be imitated, but
      
      
      have had the audacity to compress, Procrustes-<u>wise</u>, his touching lines into the stocks of my verse. Do, I beg of you, do me the great
      favor to present them to him, in my name, when next you see him. Insignificant as
      is the attention, it is at any rate a straw which will show which way the wind blows.
      If ever I go to America, I assure you that one of my first visits will be to this
      most sympathetic of poets, for whose large &amp; lofty nature my admiration is merged
      into <u>love</u>."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>No one has written to me about the lecture.<sup><a href="#sjs.00003_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> How did it succeed?
   </p>

      Yours very truly

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0871">1. Richard Watson Gilder
      (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <em>The Century</em>, from 1881 until his death. Whitman had met
      Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1955], 482). Whitman attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
      Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the <em>New York Tribune</em>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder
      one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
      delirium" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">Sunday, August 5, 1888</a>). For more about Gilder, see Susan L.
      Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_95.html">Gilder, Richard Watson (1844–1909)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3009">2. William Charles Bonaparte-Wyse
      (1826–1892) was an Irish poet living in France. He had translated
      Whitman's "I Heard You Solemn-Sweet Pipes of the Organ" and "Reconciliation"
      into Provençal, a minority dialect of southern France. His parents were Sir
      Thomas Wyse, an Irish politician, and Marie Bonaparte, a French author.
      Bonaparte-Wyse was a great-nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte. He was married to Ellen
      Linzee Prout (1842–1925). For more on Wyse and his Whitman translations,
      see Thomas Donaldson, <em>Walt Whitman the Man</em> (New York:
      Francis P. Harper, 1896), 215–220. For his parents, see: "Wyse, Sir
      Thomas" <em>A Compendium of Irish Biography</em> (Dublin: M.H.
      Gill &amp; Son, 1878), 574.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00003_n1">3. On , Burroughs informed Whitman that
      Richard Watson Gilder wanted to organize a "benefit" in New York at which the
      poet was to lecture on Lincoln (see also the letter from Whitman to Burroughs of
      ). Burroughs suggested that
      Stedman and Swinton should be invited to support the project. Whitman wrote on
      the envelope of Burroughs's letter: "(first suggestion of lecture)."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n1034">4. Helena de Kay Gilder
      (1846–1916), the wife of poet and editor Richard Watson Gilder, was a
      painter as well as the founder of the Society of American Artists and the Art
      Student's League. She worked closely with her husband, designing the text
      illustrations for all of his books of poetry.<a href="#r4">[back]
