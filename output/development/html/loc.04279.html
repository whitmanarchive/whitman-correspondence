      <br xmlns="" class="opener">1888, Octr, 12
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Many times during the past four or five weeks I have thought of your cordial
      invitation to me to write to you, but I have waited until I have got settled into
      my
      new mode of life before availing myself of the pleasure. Since I saw you I have
      spent nearly a fortnight at Mt. Desert— an island which in small space combines
      every variety of scenery—ocean and cliffs, mountain and lake, forest and
      beach— an  epitome
      of what those who love beautiful landscape (and seascape) prize most. I wished, as
      I stood on the top of Green Mountain, the highest point on the island, and looked
      down upon a view of indescribable beauty &amp; variety that I could by some magic
      have brought it all before your eyes, because I suspected that in Camden you would
      have given much for such a sight and also for many a long breath of the fresh brisk
      breeze. I can't describe to you the mysterious fascination the ocean has for me, or
      how  I was stirred
      and pleased to hear once more the tone from his "husky-haughty lips"<sup><a href="#loc.04279_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>— those
      ceaseless chatterers and orators. 
   </p>
   
   <p> As you are probably aware Bar Harbor, the chief place on Mt. Desert, has become a
      fashionable resort. A few years ago the natives, (like most of the Maine folk, dull,
      cloddish creatures) passed from season to season in unbroken monotony, content to
      grab a few vegetables from ill-tilled, rocky, soil and to live on smoked fish. Not
      so
      long before them the Indians themselves built their wigwams and hunted game in the
      forests. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Now, you meet the rich [
      <span class="unclear">idlers?</span>]
      
       from Boston, New
      York, Chicago and other cities, during their gorgeous turn-outs along well-kept roads.
      French cooks
      poke their white caps from the kitchen windows of costly villas, and French millinery
      adorns
      fashionable ladies. In the season—that is during part of July and the whole of
      August—big hotels are crammed with thousands of visitors, and social
      extravagance reaches so high a level as in Fifth Avenue in winter. Of all this I saw
      but little, because most of the gay people had left, but I could not help
      contrasting the unsatisfying  showiness and gilded insincerity of some of the drawing rooms I
      visited, with the homelike simplicity and comfort of your little parlor, where I
      found "plain living and high thinking"<sup><a href="#loc.04279_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> embodied. For that privilege I shall long be
      grateful. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Well, I came back from Mt. Desert feeling much better in body and spirits, having
      exchanged some of the heaviness and weariness contracted in Philadelphia for the
      beneficient effects wrought by crisp air, blue skies, endlessly fascinating play of
      color and shadows in sea and slopes, and old ocean's tranquilizing drone. Without
      much trouble I found a sunny room in Cambridge  and having at last got my books
      within reach I begin to feel at home. It is pleasant to be my own master again, and
      to be able, for the present at least, to follow my inclinations. If I am reading I
      need not hurry
      to reach the office, or submit to other interruption; if I wish to walk, the day and
      the night, and roads leading in all directions, are mine. Occasionally comes the
      desire of writing but the proper moment has not yet accompanied it, and I do not
      force myself, suspecting that as I gradually outline the strain upon mind and body
      which nearly four years of  constant journalistic drudgery caused, the impulse to write will
      need no coaxing. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I attend several courses at the University, chiefly upon historical subjects. Good
      fortune for me has been James Russell Lowell's<sup><a href="#n3105" id="r3">3</a></sup> consent to conduct a course dealing
      with Dante and Cervantes. I have as yet met him but once, but then I was charmed by
      him. You won't detect pedant or such about him, but a splendid example of a
      cultivated American, who knows the best that other lands and times have to offer,
      but who is still American. I look forward to a closer acquaintance with him.
      Certainly, it will be impossible to meet such a man  frequently without getting much
      good. I find it of inestimable value to see in operation traits and principles over
      which men theorize interminably. Better, one example of nobility than fifty recipes
      for it. And so, in Mr. Lowell, one has a remarkable pattern of the man of broad
      culture. When I remember that he dared to lift his voice against slavery years ago,
      when to do so was dangerous to one's body and particularly difficult for those who
      belonged to the social circle in which he and Wendell Phillips were brought
      up—when I remember this, and witness the well-deserved honor of his later
      years, I think he must stand among  the few thoroughly fortunate poets
      who have received during their lifetime what usually is bestowed upon poets' memory.
      Of course you are familiar with Lowell's "Commemoration Ode"<sup><a href="#loc.04279_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—a poem, it seems
      to me—in which the best Americanism gets itself uttered in memorable fashion. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I was very glad to receive several weeks ago an account of the horse and phaeton.
      I
      am sorry that I knew nothing of the surprise beforehand so that I might have had the
      pleasure of being among those who planned the gift. I hope you are able to drive
      every day, and that from your new point of view you will make some observation that
      you will share with your  friends. Do you discover a different aspect in nature and men now
      that you look down upon them from the seat of your vehicle? I earnestly wish that
      this new possession may bring you much pleasure and improve your health. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I have given the newspapers so little attention during the past month—merely
      glancing at its telegraphic news from day to day—that I haven't seen anything
      that might interest you, which you have not also seen; but I shall soon be more
      regular in skimming the English &amp; American weeklies, and I will send you
      whatever I deem 
      you would care to have. I am reading—among a dozen books—Lewes's "Life
      of Goethe,"<sup><a href="#loc.04279_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> bright, easy and entertaining. Like everything that pertains to Goethe
      this account of him has an especial charm for me.—But I must stop, first,
      because you may find my garrulity tedious, and second, because the clocks have
      tolled midnight. 
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Very truly
      <br></br>William R. Thayer.
      
   </p> 
    
   
   <p> P.S. It occurs to me to remind you of that letter of Sidney Lanier<sup><a href="#n0888" id="r6">6</a></sup> which we spoke
      of in one of our talks—and yet I feel that I have but slight claim upon
      your good nature.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Roscoe Thayer
      (1859–1923) was an American historian, editor of John Hay's letters, and a
      biographer of Theodore Roosevelt. He would publish <em>Personal
         Recollections of Walt Whitman</em> in 1919.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04279_n1">1. Thayer is alluding to
      Whitman's 1884 poem, "With Husky-Haughty Lips, O Sea!" <a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04279_n2">2. Thayer is quoting William
      Wordsworth's sonnet "Written in London, September, 1802." Emerson also used the
      phrase in his essay "Domestic Life."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3105">3. James Russell Lowell
      (1819–1891) was an American critic, poet and editor of <em>The Atlantic</em>. One Whitman's famous poetic contemporaries, Lowell was
      committed to conventional poetic form, which was clearly at odds with Whitman's
      more experimental form. Still, as editor of the <em>Atlantic
         Monthly</em>, he published Whitman's "Bardic Symbols," probably at Ralph
      Waldo Emerson's suggestion. Lowell later wrote a tribute to Abraham Lincoln
      titled "Commemoration Ode," which has often, since its publication, been
      contrasted with Whitman's own tribute, "O Captain! My Captain!" For further
      information on Whitman's views of Lowell, See William A. Pannapacker, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_198.html">Lowell, James Russell (1819–1891)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998)<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04279_n3">4. Lowell's "Ode Recited at the
      Harvard Commemoration, July 21, 1865," was in honor of Harvard students who died
      in the Civil War.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04279_n4">5. The English philosopher and
      critic George Henry Lewes (1817–1878) published his <em>Life
         of Goethe</em> in 1855.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0888">6. Sidney Lanier (1842–1881) was
      a Southern poet and musician who fought for the Confederacy and eventually
      became a professor at Johns Hopkins University. See his , letter to Whitman. For more infromation about Lanier,
