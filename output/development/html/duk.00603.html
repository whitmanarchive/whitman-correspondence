      he insisted when he first came home on
      saturday  on their going but i think he got
      rather sorry he did before they started
      i think he wished matt<sup><a href="#duk.00465_n9" id="r3">3</a></sup> to go but the children<sup><a href="#duk.00603_n17" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      was so noisey  he got sick of his bargain

      but its  very
      evedent  she will be boss george has spent
      700 dollars for his house i think he will not
      add much to his bank book) i know walt
      you will say mother is childish but
      walt there is such a difference when he
      used to come home he would ask me if i
      wanted any thing when he went down town
      saturday  but it was so different this time

      14 dollars and over per day) but walt there is no
      knowing what or how a man may change
      when he gets married george is certainly
      the last one you would think as he
      always was set in his way) but as you
      say by my putting a bed in the front
      room wonders will never cease

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00603_n4">1. This letter dates to
      between March 7 and May 15, 1871. On an accompanying slip of paper held in
      the Trent Collection (not reproduced here), Richard Maurice Bucke dated the
      letter March 1871 with a note that George Washington Whitman, who married in
      "March '71," spent $700 on his house and is already living in Camden, New
      Jersey at the time of the letter. <br><br>
      George probably married Louisa Orr Haslam on March 14, 1871 (see Walt
      Whitman, "Marriages," Missouri Historical Society, reprinted in <em>Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</em>, ed.
      Edward F. Grier [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 27; and see H.
      Stanley Craig, <em>Camden County New Jersey Marriages,
         1837–1910: Records Filed in the Office of the County Clerk</em>
      [Merchantville, New Jersey: H. Stanley Craig, 1932], 133). A March date for
      George's marriage conflicts with Whitman scholarly consensus, that he
      married Louisa Orr on April 14, 1871 (see Richard Maurice Bucke, "Genealogy
      of Whitman Family," Trent Collection, Duke University, reprinted in Gay
      Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York:
      Macmillan, 1955], 596). But because March 14 is both in Walt Whitman's hand
      and is derived independently from the records assembled by Craig, March 14
      for the date of George's marriage is likely correct. Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman and daughters arrived in Brooklyn no earlier than February
      14 but perhaps several days later (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman).
      Another letter that may corroborate the March marriage is Louisa's  letter to Walt.
      If a March 14 marriage date for George and Louisa Orr Haslam is assumed, and
      Mattie's family began their five- or six-week visit to Brooklyn and Camden
      in late February, this letter dates to just before the marriage (March 7?)
      or just after it (March 15–17?). The latest possible date for this
      letter can be inferred from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's expectation that
      Mattie Whitman will report to Walt about Brooklyn after she returns "home,"
      possibly to Brooklyn unless Mattie is returning to St. Louis directly from
      Camden. Mattie and family may be en route to St. Louis, or they may be
      visiting George and Louisa Orr near their marriage date. Louisa's next
      extant letter to Walt, , refers
      to St. Louis but not to Mattie's recent visit, so Mattie and family had
      returned to St. Louis by mid-May.<br><br>To summarize, this letter could date
      to some days before George and Louisa's marriage (March 7?), to just after
      their marriage (March 15–17?), or to just before the return of Mattie
      and daughters to St. Louis (March 30–May 14?). If Louisa's  letter dates
      April 30, the latest possible date for this letter is a week or two after
      that letter, from May 7 to May 15, 1871. However, this letter is likely to
      date earlier, to just after Mattie and daughters visit George and Louisa Orr
      in Camden near their marriage.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00556_n3">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">3. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00603_n17">4. The children are Martha
      Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's daughters Manahatta (1860–1886), known as
      "Hattie," and Jessie Louisa (1863–1957), known as "Sis." Hattie, who lived
      most of the first seven years of her life in the same home with Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman, was especially close to her grandmother. Hattie and Sis (known
      also as "California" and "Duti") were both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00603_n12">5. Mattie Whitman is going to
      meet George's fiancée or new wife Louisa Orr Haslam (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," at their new home at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00603_n6">6. If the letter dates to late
      April and Manahatta Whitman has received a periodical with a newly published
      poem by Walt Whitman, the poem is "Warble for Lilac-Time," <em>Galaxy</em> 9 (May 1871), 686. However, in that case Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman has named the wrong periodical. The spelling "graphe" more likely refers
      to a celebrated London periodical, <em>The Graphic: An Illustrated
         Weekly Newspaper</em>, which was founded by William Luson Thomas
      (1830–1900) and began publication in December 1869. Its high-quality
      illustrations and its coverage of the Franco-Prussian War helped its circulation
      to rise rapidly, to around 50,000 subscribers by 1870 and up to 250,000
      subscribers by 1874. See Laurel Brake &amp; Marysa Demoor, ed., <em>Dictionary of Nineteenth-Century Journalism</em> (London:
      British Library, 2009). Louisa also acknowledged a copy of the <em>Graphic</em> in her  letter
      to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
