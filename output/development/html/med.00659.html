   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00659_n1">1. This letter has been cut up
      and reassembled. On the back of it Whitman drafted "The Sobbing of the Bells."
      The words in brackets have been supplied from a transcription in Horace Traubel,
      <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (New York: Mitchell
      Kennerley, 1915), 2:136. Traubel wrote of the transcription: "W. gave me a bit
      of his writing which proved to be a draft of his Garfield poem, The Sobbing of
      the Bells. I found it was written on the reverse of a letter written to W. by
      Boyle O'Reilly. Spoke of it to W. 'Yes, so I see. That must have been in the
      eighties, while I was in Boston. Yes, we want art: I saw the Millet pictures at
      Shaw's: it was a great day.' As W. had cut the Boyle letter and pieced it
      together again irregularly it is now difficult to make out. Up in the corner of
      the letter O'R. wrote: 'Shall see you at Bartlett's Thursday.' This is the
      letter as I have got it together with perhaps a word or two not literally in
      place."<a href="#r1">[back]
