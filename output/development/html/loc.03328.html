      <br></br><br></br>Dear Poet,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I write to wish you all that you wish for yourself—all that is best, on your
      birthday to-morrow! I meant to have had the lines overleaf complete to send you for
      the day, but somehow they do not fall into the right order. However you will take
      the will for the deed, I know; &amp; perhaps in a day or two I may be able to render
      them in a better shape, when I write again to tell you of my doings since I saw you
      last.
   </p>
   
   <p>A splendid time to-night at Metropolitan Opera House,—listening to Col. Bob
      Ingersoll<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r2">2</a></sup>. (Vide morning papers!) More of this anon. I am
      at Stedman's<sup><a href="#n1043" id="r3">3</a></sup>. He sends birthday greetings.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With great love, 
      <br></br>Ernest Rhys
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <h4 class="indent">To Walt Whitman—On his 69th birthday.</h4>
   <p>
      Here health I bring you in one draught of song.
      <br>Caught in my rhymester's cup from earth's delight
      <br>Where English fields are green the whole year long,—
      <br>The wine of night
      <br>That the new-come spring distills most sweet and strong
      <br>In the viewless air's alembic wrought too fine for sight.
      <br><br>
      Now shall all pain be gone for this one day,
      <br>As, drinking deep of this brimm'd wassail cup,
      <br>You feel the years uncoil &amp; their travailing pass away,
      <br>Till, ere you drink it up,
      <br>Again the sun's quick fires you
      feel pulse brainward through the blood,
      <br>Again, as when in youth they pulsed, making the world seem good.
      <br><br>
      For this the magic wine,
      <br>That, tasted by the chosen lips, makes Life as long as
      thought,—
      <br>Elixir this long sought,
      <br>Filled of the sun &amp; the wind &amp; all green growing things,
      <br>The salt of the sea &amp; the sweet of the earth,
      <br>And the potencies of death &amp; birth,—
      <br>That tasted once makes men as gods &amp; the common world divine.
      <br><br></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03328_n1">1. This letter is addressed: To
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street, | Camden, | New Jersey. It is postmarked: NEW
      YORK | [illegible] 7 | 12 M | F; Camden

   <p id="n0839">2. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1043">3. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
