      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I have just got your complete works Ed. 1871 and would like to ask you why you did
      not reprint the preface to the first edition? I have only read extracts from that
      preface and should like to have seen the whole reprinted. I suppose I can not get
      the old Ed now at the stores.
   </p>
   
   <p>I saw the other day that Mr. Swinburne said he enjoyed your "Song of the Sea"  more than any of your
      works. Did he mean Sea Shore Memories No 1—?The poem of yours that I read over
      with the most satisfaction is your Burial Hymn of Lincoln. But as my opinion is not
      worth anything, being a boy, I should not have [

      it upon you. If you are pressed by
      time, even then I should like to hear from you—just a word.
      
   </p>

      Yours most respectfully,

   <p>P. S. Do you know where I could get a 1st Ed with
      preface?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Philip Hale (1854–1934), a music critic and
      program annotator for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, wrote to Walt Whitman for
      the first time on  (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], 3:533). Hale wrote again on October 7, 1875
       (The Library of
      Congress), to praise the "Calamus" poems and to enclose a copy of "Walt
      Whitman," which he published in the <em>Yale Literary
         Magazine</em> in November 1874, 96–104. Walt Whitman sent <em>Two Rivulets</em> to Hale on September 3, 1876 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book).
