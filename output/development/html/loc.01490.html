      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I ought before now to have thanked you for the poem "After all, not to create only",
      which I read with very great interest &amp; pleasure. The evening I came to Dublin a
      friend—Todhunter<sup><a href="#n0640" id="r1">1</a></sup>—offered to lend me a copy cut out of a New York newspaper, not
      knowing I had seen it. Much work lying before me on my return here prevented me from
      thanking you sooner.
   </p>
   
   
   <p> Probably the Hon. Roden Noel,<sup><a href="#n0815" id="r2">2</a></sup> almost certainly Mr Rossetti has sent you a copy of
      this month's "Dark Blue"—nevertheless on the chance of your not having seen it I
      post a copy. I think you can hardly fail to be pleased with the article upon your
      poems. The essay in the same number  upon Robert Browning<sup><a href="#n0116" id="r3">3</a></sup> is by Miss West,<sup><a href="#n0690" id="r4">4</a></sup> whom I named to you as one
      who knew &amp; loved what you have written.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I also send you the first morsel of O'Grady's<sup><a href="#n0453" id="r5">5</a></sup> writing (I named him to you also),
      which has got into print—"Apollo". You will see, I think, that he springs from
      Carlyle<sup><a href="#n0139" id="r6">6</a></sup> on one side, &amp; from you on the other, &amp; is an aristocratic-democrat
      or democratic aristocrat. I do not wholly like "Apollo". I think he has made Apollo
      (&amp; his English fellow) too idle, a god of glorious play merely, whereas he
      really does each day a good day's joyous work, illuminating the world, &amp; slaying
      Python, &amp; doctoring sick folk in a magnificent  manner.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have heard here that Mr. Tennyson<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r7">7</a></sup> has asked you to come to him. I hope you will
      come. And if to England—to Ireland too. And if to Ireland, would you not come to
      this house if you had not pleasanter quarters? Your welcome, at least, would be very
      sincere.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>).

      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0640">1. Dr. John Todhunter (1839–1916) was
      characterized by Edward Dowden as "a man of science, &amp; a mystic—a Quaker" in
      his , letter to Walt Whitman.
      Todhunter later held a chair in English literature at Alexandria College in
      Dublin and wrote <em>Study of Shelley</em> (1880), in which he
      termed Shelley, Hugo, and Walt Whitman the three poets of democracy. See Harold
      Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in England</em> (1934), 180.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0815">2. Roden Noel (1834–1894) was an
      English poet. Noel came from an aristocratic English family, and in his youth
      developed socialist sympathies. He was a close friend of the poet and
      influential critic Robert Buchanan, and it may have been through Buchanan that
      Noel first encountered <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In 1871 (the same
      year that he first wrote to Whitman). Noel published an essay entitled "A Study
      of Walt Whitman" in <em>The Dark Blue</em> (Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in England</em> [Ithaca, NY: Cornell University
      Press, 1934], 147–149).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0116">3. Robert Browning (1812–1889) was an English
      poet known for his dramatic monologues, including "Porphyria's Lover" and "My
      Last Duchess." Browning was also the husband of poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning
      (1806–1861).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0690">4. Elizabeth D. West, daughter of the dean of St.
      Patrick's in Dublin, was one of Edward Dowden's students, and an author and
      translator of German texts herself. She became Dowden's second wife in 1895, and
      after his death published <em>Fragments from Old Letters—E. D. to
         E. D. W., 1869–1892</em> (1914).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0453">5. Standish James O'Grady (1846–1928), a lawyer
      and later a celebrated Irish poet, published (under the pseudonym Arthur Clive)
      "Walt Whitman: the Poet of Joy," the <em>Gentleman's
         Magazine</em>, 15 (1875), 704–716, in which he concluded: Walt Whitman "is
      the noblest literary product of modern times, and his influence is invigorating
      and refining beyond expression." See Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt
         Whitman in England</em> (1934), 180–182, and Hugh Art O'Grady, <em>Standish James O'Grady—The Man &amp; the Writer</em> (1929).
      See also Joann P. Krieg, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00160.html">Walt Whitman and the Irish</a></em>, "Dublin" (ch. 8).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0139">6. Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) was a Scottish
      writer who wrote frequently on the conflict between scientific changes and the
      traditional social (often religious) order. For Whitman's writings on Carlyle in
      <em>Specimen Days</em>, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf087v1">Death of Thomas Carlyle</a>" and "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf088v1">Carlyle from American Points of View</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0625">7. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r7">[back]
