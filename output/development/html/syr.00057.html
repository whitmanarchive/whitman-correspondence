   <p>I have not been able to write you again for William<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup> has been and is very ill. On the
      6th, Wednesday, he had five of those epileptic seizures, the last four from 5 P. M.
      to 9.30, going from one to another without recovering consciousness. He has not been
      up since, and is very weak and sick, and his mind is not clear yet. Will send word
      again as soon as I can.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
