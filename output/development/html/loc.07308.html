   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4284">2. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="loc.03027_n4">3. For Whitman's seventieth
      birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
      the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
      (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.30.html">Tuesday, May 7, 1889</a>. The day was celebrated with a testimonial
      dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
      addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
      arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07306_n1">4. In his letter of , Whitman told Bucke that he sent a
      copy of the pocket-book edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. The
      poet had the special pocket-book edition printed in honor of his 70th
      birthday–May 31, 1889–through special arrangement with Frederick
      Oldach. See Whitman's , letter to
      Oldach. Only 300 copies were printed, and Whitman signed the title page of each
      one. The volume also included the annex <em>Sands at Seventy</em>
      and his essay <em>A Backward Glance O'er Traveled Roads</em>. For
      more information on the book see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a></em>. Bucke's copy of the 1889 pocket-book edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> is described in the Sotheby &amp; Co
      (1935) and the American Art Association (1936) auction catalogues of his Whitman
      collection. The item is numbered 11 and 294, respectively.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07308_n2">5. Horace Traubel notes that
      Whitman received "a letter from Dr. A____t of London, Ontario" (Horace Traubel,
      <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.62.html">Saturday, June 8, 1889)</a>. Gertrude Traubel seems to have been unable
      to decipher her father's handwritten record of the physician's name. Dr. Charles
      A. Sippi's diary provides no clue as to the identity of Dr. A____t. However, a
      Dr. Henry Arnott is listed at 226 Queens Avenue, London, Ontario in 1890. There
      is no earlier listing (letter of March 13, 1974 from Edward Phelps of the Weldon
      Library).<a href="#r5">[back]
