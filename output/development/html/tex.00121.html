      Mr. Whitman
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am seated in an easy chair pen in hand trying to scribble a few lines to you. I
      expect it will take me all day to write this for I cant sit up but a few moments at
      a time. I was taken down with chills &amp; fever when I got to Pittsburg. I stayed there
      from Saturday night until Monday morning before any train left I dont think I ever was so sick in my life as I was in Pittsburg I about gave up there that
      I never should get home alive, but there was a Dr there he gave me some medison he said that would take me home &amp; it did.
   </p>
   
   <p>We was behind time at most every place we changed cars so we had to wait I expected
      to have got home in three days at the outside but instead of three I was six.
   </p>
   
   <p>It dont look much like winter here there is not a parrticle of snow on the ground &amp; its about such weather as it was in Washington although its
      not quite so muddy There hasnt been any sleighing here this winter &amp; there wont be now its to late in the season
   </p>
   
   <p>They are making maple sugar in this part of the world now when I get well I will eat
      some for you but I suppose you think that wont do you much good.
   </p>
   
   <p>I tell you I am glad I am out of that Hospital &amp; when I get into another to stay I
      will let you know it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Oh how are you getting along with your office I am in hopes you have recd it before
      this time I begun to think that your office &amp; my discharge had gone to the same place
      now I have got my papers I think you had ought to receive yours
   </p>
   
   <p>I cant write any more this time my hand trembles so I can hardly write but I will
      try &amp; do better next time give my best respects to Mr &amp; Mrs O Connor.<sup><a href="#tex.00121_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> Yours &amp;c.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Justus F. Boyd was a
      soldier in the 6th Michigan Cavalry. Whitman wrote the following entry on Boyd
      in a notebook that he kept shortly after his appointment to the Christian
      Commission, January 20, 1863 ("Walt Whitman Soldier's," Thomas Biggs Harned
      Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #99, sheets
      1098–1133): "Corp. Justus F. Boyd bed 22 co. D 6th Michigan cavalry been
      in five months, four sick, affection of kidneys and pleurisy—wants some paper
      and envelope and something to read gave him 12 sheets paper, &amp; 12 envelopes

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00121_n2">1. For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
      John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
      years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an intelligent man who
      deserved something better than the various governmental clerical posts he was to
      hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship, however, was relieved by the
      presence of Whitman whom he was to love and venerate—and defend with a
      single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of vituperation and eulogy that have
      seldom been equaled, most notably in his pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was
      the first, and in many ways the most important, of the adulators who divided
      people arbitrarily into two categories: those who were for and those who were
      against Walt Whitman. The poet praised O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous
      collection of his tales: "He was a born sample here in the 19th century of the
      flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his
      memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton,
      1910] pp. 513). For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>. Of the O'Connors, Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman wrote on : "I am
      real glad, my dear Walt, that you are among such good people. I hope it will be
      in the power of some of our family to return their kindness some day. I'm sure
      twould be done with a heartfelt gratitude. Tis pleasant, too, to think, that
      there are still people of that kind left."<a href="#r1">[back]
