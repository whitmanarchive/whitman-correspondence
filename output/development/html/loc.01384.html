      <br></br><br></br></span><span>Dear Mr. Whitman—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was very, very glad to get thy postal card<sup><a href="#loc.01384_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; thy congratulations on the birth
      of our second little daughter,<sup><a href="#n6186" id="r2">2</a></sup> who is two months old today. We
      have just brought her back from the country, where we all had a most delightful
      Easter holiday. How thee would have enjoyed our drives! The fields &amp; lanes were
      starred with primroses &amp; daffodils, &amp; the hedges were just breaking into
      bloom. The air was fragrant &amp; warm &amp; the birds seemed intoxicated with joy
      at the return of Spring. The English country is so beautiful—it is different,
      too, from anything we can see at home. There is a mellow historical air brooding
      over everything—the old common lands, dating from Saxon times—which are
      beautiful even if they are not useful in an agricultural sense—the quaint old
      rambling villages with mossy thatched roofs, clustering about the gates of some lordly
      park, of whose castle or gabled Manor House one can catch glimpses through the
      magnificent trees—I do not say I <u>approve</u> of grand
      castles &amp; dependent villages—or even of so much waste land. But I enjoy it
      even more than an Englishman could, I think, since I don't feel responsible for its
      existence.
   </p>
   
   <p>We have come back again to work, political, legal, &amp; social—&amp; of these
      three the hardest is the social. I grow more disinclined every year for the
      kind of amusement which society here offers—which is not amusement at all, but
      a struggle for notoriety.
   </p>
   
   <p>Little Ray<sup><a href="#n3137" id="r3">3</a></sup> has entered the enchanted land of imagination. She
      lives in "'tories" &amp; "p'etends" &amp; we are in terror of our lives from her
      deadly assaults as a "bear-lion." She usually eats her supper in the character of
      an
      "efelant" with a "long nose" &amp; a "big mouff," &amp; when she wakes up in the
      night I sometimes find her transformed into a loudly purring "pussy-cat"
      or a wriggling "'nake." Her little sister is still in the mental attitude of an
      oyster—except that on occasion she can do what I believe no animal ever
      did—laugh. But that is not quite true—I can remember one animal who used
      to laugh—Antecellere—the horse I had so many years. He used to laugh
      when I fell off—sometimes he laughed so hard that he would forget to run
      away.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is an English friend of mothers' who has long been a disciple of thine. She
      is
      going to America soon &amp; is so <u>very</u> anxious to see thee
      that I ventured to give her a letter to thee. But I told her of thy ill-health &amp;
      warned her that thee might not be well enough to see her—so thee will not
      [
      <span class="unclear">feel in?</span>]
       necessary
      at all, if thee doesn't feel like seeing her when she comes.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am just preparing a speech on "Sugar Bounties"—which I am to give soon at The
      Annual Meeting of the Women's Liberal Federation.<sup><a href="#n6185" id="r4">4</a></sup> It is one of
      the burning questions of the day, &amp; is really the old contest between Free Trade
      &amp; Protection, under a new form. I am on the Free Trade side, in spite of my
      American upbringing.
   </p>
   
   <p>I must close to get this in today's post. With love &amp; always with sincerest
      wishes for thy health, I am,
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      advocated for women's suffrage (steadily since 1892) and promoted just
      legislation for women.<a href="#r4">[back]
