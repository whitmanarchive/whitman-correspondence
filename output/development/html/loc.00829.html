      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Jeff
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I received your letter yesterday—I too had got a few lines from George dated on the
      field, 16th—he said he had also just written to mother—I cannot make out there has
      been any fighting since in which the 9th Corps has been engaged—I do hope Mother will
      not get despondent &amp; so unhappy—I suppose it is idle to say I think George's chances
      are very good for coming out of this campaign safe, yet at present it seems to me
      so—but it is indeed idle to say so, for no one can tell what a day may bring forth<sup><a href="#loc.00829_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Sometimes I think that should it come, when it <em>must</em> be, to fall in battle, one's anguish over a son or brother killed, would be tempered
      with much to take the edge off—I can honestly say it has no terrors for me, if I had
      to be hit in battle, as far as I myself am concerned—it would be a noble &amp; manly death,
      &amp; in the best cause—then one finds, as I have the past year, that our feelings &amp; imaginations
      make a thousand times too much of the whole matter—Of the many I have seen die, or
      known of, the past year, I have not seen or heard of <em>one</em> who met death with any terror—Yesterday afternoon I spent a good part of the afternoon
      with a young man of 17, named Charles Cutter,<sup><a href="#loc.00829_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> of Lawrence City, Mass, 1st Mass heavy artillery, battery M—he was brought in to one
      of the hospitals mortally wounded in abdomen—Well I thought to myself as I sat looking
      at him, it ought to be a relief to his folks after all, if they could see how little
      he suffered—he lay very placid, in a half lethargy, with his eyes closed, it was very
      warm, &amp; I sat a long while fanning him &amp; wiping the sweat, at length he opened his
      eyes quite wide &amp; clear, &amp; looked inquiringly around. I said, What is it, my dear,
      do you want any thing?—he said quietly with a good natured smile, O nothing, I was
      only looking around to see who was with me—his mind was somewhat wandering, yet he
      lay so peaceful, in his dying condition—he seemed to be a real New England country
      boy, so good natured, with a pleasant homely way, &amp; quite a fine looking boy—without
      any doubt he died in course of night—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There dont seem to be any war news of importance very late—We have been fearfully disappointed
      with Sigel<sup><a href="#loc.00829_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> not making his junction from the lower part of the valley, &amp; perhaps harrassing Lee's left, or left rear, which (the junction or equivalent to it) was an indispensable
      part of Grant's plan, we think—this is one great reason why things have lagged so
      with the Army—some here are furious with Sigel, you will see he has been superseded—his
      losses in his repulse are not so important, though annoying enough, but it was of
      the greatest consequence that he should have hastened through the gaps ten or twelve
      days ago at all hazards &amp; come in from the west, keeping near enough to our right
      to have assistance if he needed it—Jeff, I suppose you know that there has been quite
      a large army lying idle, mostly of artillery reg'ts manning the numerous forts around
      here, they have been the fattest &amp; heartiest reg'ts any where to be seen, &amp; full in
      numbers, some of them numbering 2000 men—well, they have all, every one, been shoved
      down to the front—lately we have had the militia reg'ts pouring in here mostly from
      Ohio, they look first rate, I saw two or three come in yesterday, splendid American
      young men, from farms mostly—we are to have them for a hundred days &amp; probably they
      will not refuse to stay another hundred—Jeff, tell mother I shall write Wednesday
      certain (or if I hear any thing I will write to-morrow)—I still think we shall get
      Richmond—
   </p>

      <br></br>Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Jeff, of course you must take this up to mother soon as you go home—Jeff, I have changed
      my quarters—I moved Saturday last—I am now at 502 Pennsylvania av, near 3d st.—I still
      go a little almost daily to Major Hapgood's, cor 15th &amp; F st., 5th floor, am apt to
      be there about 12 or 1.—I am well, go the same among wounded day &amp; night—see Fred
      McReady, &amp; others of 51st—George's letter to me of 16th I sent to Han—should like
      to see Mr Worthen<sup><a href="#loc.00829_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> if he comes here—give my best remembrance to Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00829_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have writ to George several times in hopes one at least may reach him—Matty, my
      dear sister, how are [you] getting along—O how I should like to see you this very
      day—
   </p>
   
   <p>I may very likely go down for a few days to Bell Plain &amp; Fredericksburgh, but one
      is wanted here permanently more than any other place—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00829_n1">1. From Spotsylvania,
      Virginia, on  George Washington
      Whitman described to his mother a skirmish of his regiment which cost "22 killed
      and wounded." "About One O'clock yesterday morning," he continued, "we were
      relieved in the rifle pitts and withdrawn to the rear, where we are now, resting
      ourselves and having good times. Mother, I suppose you know how we are getting
      along, better than we do ourselves, for I expect the newspaper correspondents
      keep you pretty well posted as to our movements, and here there are so many
      rumors flying around, that a fellow only knows, what he sees himself."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00829_n2">2. Charles Cutter's
      unexpectedly delayed death is reported in Walt Whitman's letters from , , and . When Whitman
      printed his abridged version of this letter in <em>November
         Boughs</em> (<em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>
      [New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 6:230–232), he evidently forgot that
      Cutter had lingered for two weeks: "His mind was somewhat wandering, yet he lay
      in an evident peacefulness that sanity and health might have envied. I had to
      leave for other engagements. He died, I heard afterward, without any special
      agitation, in the course of the night." In addition, he altered phraseology:
      "What is it, my dear" became "What is it, my boy?"; "it was very warm" was
      rendered "it was extremely hot."<a href="#r2">[back]
