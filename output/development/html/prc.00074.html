      <br></br><br></br>Dear Helen Price
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your good letter has come, &amp; I am glad indeed to hear from you, &amp; sister
      &amp; father, &amp; have you <em>located</em>—All sorrowful,
      solemn, yet soothing thoughts come up in my mind at reminiscences of my dear friend,
      your dear mother<sup><a href="#prc.00074_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—have often thought of you all,
      since '73 the last time I saw you so briefly—so sadly—
   </p>
   
   <p>About Dr Bucke—(he is a long-established <em>medical doctor</em>
      &amp; head of the Asylum for the Insane, at London, Ontario, Canada)—you can
      write to him freely &amp; send him what you feel to—he is a true &amp; trusted
      friend of mine—I know him well<sup><a href="#prc.00074_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just returned from Boston, where I have been the past week—went on to
      read my annual <em>Death of Abraham Lincoln</em> on the anniversary of
      that tragedy—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am pretty well for me—am still under the benumbing influences of paralysis,
      but thankful to be as well as I am—still board here (make my head quarters
      here) with my brother &amp; his wife—Eddy, my brother, is living &amp; well,
      he is now boarding 
      ab't
      
       40 miles from here<sup><a href="#prc.00074_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Yes,
      Helen dear, when I come to New York, I will send you word sure—Best love to
      you, Emmy, father &amp; all, especially little Walter<sup><a href="#prc.00074_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00074_n1">1. This letter bears the
      address: Miss Helen E. Price | Woodside | Long Island | New York.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00074_n2">2. Abby H. Price, an old
      friend of the Whitman family, had died on May 4, 1878; see <em>Putnam's Monthly</em>, 5 (1908), 163–169.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00074_n3">3. Undoubtedly Helen Price
      wrote to Whitman after receiving a request from Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke for
      material to be included in his study of the poet. Her reminiscences appear in
      Bucke's <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883),
      26–32. Whitman and Bucke visited Helen Price from July 23 to 28, 1881 (see
      the letter from Whitman to John Burroughs of ).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00074_n4">4. Edward, Whitman's
      brother, went on March 23 to an institution at Glen Mills, Pa. Whitman sent $16
      monthly to William V. Montgomery for Ed's care (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00074_n5">5. Helen's sister, Emily,
      who had married in 1869 (see the letter from Whitman to Abby H. Price of ), probably named one of her sons
      after the poet.<a href="#r5">[back]
