   <p>Am here yet in the sick room—the Doctor thinks it best not to go yet—have
      had no set back—but remain horribly weak in legs &amp; body—(sometimes
      wonder whether that would remain for settled)—Thanks for the <u>Catlin</u><sup><a href="#loc.01479_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—it is an 
      inexhaustable

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Donaldson
      (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
      introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
      the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
      carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt
         Whitman, the Man</em> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see
      Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_111.html">Donaldson, Thomas (1843–1898)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01479_n1">1. Donaldson's letter to
      Whitman does not seem to be extant, but this appears to be a reference to a book
      by George Catlin (1796–1872), an artist who focused on portraying Native
      Americans in the Old West. Whitman famously kept a portrait of Osceola by Catlin
      on his wall.<a href="#r1">[back]
