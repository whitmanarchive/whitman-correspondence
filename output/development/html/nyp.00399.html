   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Manville Wintersteen, of
      the Sixth Ohio Cavalry, was wounded in the left shoulder, and, according to the
      "Notebook: Septemberâ€“October, 1863" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection),
      "came in frozen" from a "cav[alry] fight." In his hospital notes, Whitman termed
      him "a noble sized young fellow" (Charles I. Glicksberg, <em>Walt
         Whitman and the Civil War</em> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania
      Press, 1933], 150), and referred to him briefly in <em>Specimen
         Days</em> (Richard Maurice Bucke, ed., <em>The Complete
         Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 4:134).
      In 1875 Whitman wrote to Wintersteen, who, on March 1, replied: "I can not place
      you as I did not learn your name but havent forgot the kindness I recived while
      in the Arm[or]y Square Hospital" (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New
      York Public Library). On March 10 of the same year, Wintersteen acknowledged
      receipt of Whitman's picture, and on August 5 described his not-so-prosperous
      circumstances. Whitman's letters to Wintersteen are evidently not
      extant.
