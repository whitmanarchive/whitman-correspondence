   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01706_n1">1. Walt Whitman sent "Proud Music of the
      Sea-Storm" (later called "Proud Music of the Storm"), which James T. Fields
      (1817–1881), editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>,
      promptly accepted for the magazine. After Emerson, who had received "Proud Music
      of the Sea-Storm" in Whitman's 
      letter, delivered the poem to Fields, Fields sent $100 to Whitman on . He informed Whitman on  that if he was to get the poem
      into the February issue it would be impossible to send proof to Washington.  did, however, appear
      in the February 1869 issue of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> and
      was the second of Whitman's poems to appear in the magazine;  was published in 1860.<a href="#r1">[back]
