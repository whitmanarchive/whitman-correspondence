   </p>
   
   <p>Upon the whole I shall have to beg off from Monday night. The doctor enjoins upon
      me
      that I am like an old wagon body—must keep rigidly to the smooth ordinarily
      traveled roads, &amp; not cut across lots any how. Give my friendliest greetings
      &amp; wishes to Miss Terry &amp; Mr Irving—Should they, or either, feel any
      day—say from 2 to 3 in the afternoon—like calling upon me here, I should
      rate  it a
      welcome honor.<sup><a href="#cor.00002_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>—If you have not procured the tickets before receiving this let them go
      unprocured—Best remembrances to Mrs. Williams.
   </p>

   </p>
   
   
   <p>Show this note to Miss Terry and Mr Irving—&amp; if Miss T has the least
      desire to keep it, please let her do so.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Talcott Williams
      (1849–1928) was associated with the New York <em>Sun</em>
      and <em>World</em> as well as the Springfield <em>Republican</em> before he became the editor of the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in 1879. His newspaper vigorously defended Whitman
      in news articles and editorials after the Boston censorship of 1882. For more
      information about Williams, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_108.html">Williams, Talcott (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="cor.00002_n1">1. Whitman used his poor
      health as an excuse from all social occasions which he did not wish to attend.
      From December 2 to 4 he dined daily with Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke in
      Philadelphia, and on December 4 and 5 Burroughs joined them for trips to Smith's
      home (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r1">[back]
