Thanks for all. All quiet here and nothing new. I guess
      things are pretty quiet, not to say dull, with you. You will very soon now have your
      autographing to do, quite a job for you I should think
      (?). Annual Fair begins in London today so no doubt we shall have enough visitors
      for the next week or ten days. I expect W. Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r6">6</a></sup> (and my boys)
      home this evening—guess we shall be able to move ahead with meter now. A 
      certain little hitch there was seems to be got over all O.K.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are talking of having a copy made (or get a casting) of your (Sidney Morse)<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r7">7</a></sup> bust and putting it in our new (big) amusement room (now
      building)—hope we shall be able to manage it. It would go over the front of
      store (the plan was to put Shakespeare there but as we cannot be sure of his
      likeness and can be of yours we think of this change).
   </p>
   
   <p>Mrs Bucke<sup><a href="#n4273" id="r8">8</a></sup> and children all well—we are all enjoying the
      quiet autumn days, and the good fresh fruit and vegetables from our orchards &amp;
      gardens—we have never had a more plentiful season.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n6122">4. Logan Pearsall Smith
      (1865–1946) was an essayist and literary critic. He was the son of Robert
      Pearsall Smith, a minister and writer who befriended Whitman, and he was the
      brother of Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, one of Whitman's most avid followers.

   <p id="n4284">6. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
