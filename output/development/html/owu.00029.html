      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am <u>perfectly delighted</u> with the photograph of thee
      which has just come, addressed in thy handwriting— &amp; with the date June 1 1887,
      written on it. How well I remember thee in that big comprehensive chair! 
   </p>
   
   <p>
       It has come as a
      sort of greeting to my little baby, who will be just two weeks old tomorrow. I held
      it up for her to look at, but I must truthfully confess that her attention seemed
      to
      be more absorbed with her own pink fingers that with the picture! I think  Alys or father must
      have told thee of the baby's birth, I have been hardly able to write before, &amp;
      am still in bed—but I can't keep sending a note of thanks for thy photograph,
      &amp; giving thee at the same time a little news about the wee stranger.  She weighs the
      immense amount of nine pounds, &amp; spends her days chiefly in eating, sleeping
      &amp; being adored. She almost never cries, and she sleeps the whole night through.
      She is very fat and very pretty, with great blue eyes, &amp; a fascinating little
      dimple. Alas! I am afraid I cannot hide the self-evident fact that I am very proud
      of her, and think her the most wonderful baby that was ever born. It is no use
      struggling against Fate. I meant to be strictly impartial in my judgment of her, but
      "C'est plus for que moi". I think she is a little angel. As for myself—I hope
      to be up again in a week or so, and quite well and strong. The doctor and nurse say
      I am making a marvelous recovery—but I do not find it at all hard to imagine
      physical states of greater bliss than my own. However, the Angel more than makes up
      for it all.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is a lovely day—the river is shining in the sunlight &amp; the boys are
      leaping into the water from the barges &amp; splashing merrily about. Little
      Ray—the baby—lies cooing in her cot, &amp; if I interpret her soft
      sounds aright she is sending thee her thanks for making her mother so happy by thy
      gift.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Lovingly thy friend,
      <br></br>Mary Smith Costelloe
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Please remember me to Mr. Gilchrist if he is with
      thee.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
