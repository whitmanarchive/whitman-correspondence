      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I arrived home last night between 11 and 12 all safe &amp; sound—found mother
      up waiting for me<sup><a href="#n0705" id="r1">1</a></sup>—It was dark &amp; stormy, as rain had
      set in about 1—had quite a pleasant journey— took a chair int he
      reserved seat car, 50 cts extra—plenty of room &amp; a very easy riding
      car—thought while I was sitting up here now in my room waiting for dinner I
      would write a line to boy Pete— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p><u>Thursday forenoon</u></p>
   
   <p> The weather is very fine now here—plenty cool enough—I went over to New
      York yesterday afternoon &amp; evening—took a ride up &amp; down
      Broadway—am now laying off &amp; taking it easy in my room—find it very
      pleasant here—fall just as natural into habits of doing nothing—lie on
      the sofa &amp; read the papers—come up punctually to my meals—sleep a
      great deal—&amp; take every thing very quietly 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      <u>Friday</u>—Pete I will finish this scribbling letter
      &amp; send it off so you will get it for Sunday—I am feeling well &amp;
      enjoying myself doing nothing, spending a great deal of time with my mother, &amp;
      going out a few hours every day on the river or over to New York—I hope you
      are feeling  all
      right, &amp; that every thing is lovely—I believe that is all this time— 
   </p>
   
   <p> Love to you dear son &amp; you must keep a good heart through all the tribulations
      &amp; botherations, not only railroading but life generally 
   </p>
   
   <p> I find that Foster the "car assassin," is an old driver &amp; conductor that I knew
      quite well—he was a very good man, very respectable, only a fool when
      drunk—it is the saddest case I know. He has three fine children—the
      [
      <span class="unclear">public?</span>]
       is down upon
      him savage—&amp; I suppose no hope for him.<sup><a href="#n0243" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0243">2. On 26 April 1871 William Foster
      (1837–1873), a former New York conductor, accosted a woman and her
      daughter in a street car, and was rebuked by their companion, Avery D. Putnam.
      When Putnam got off, Foster, who was drunk, killed him with a carhook. The
      murder was reported in the New York <em>Times</em> on 28 April
      1871. Pete Calhoun, one of Whitman's friends, was the driver of the car. Because
      of appeals for commutation, including one from Putman's widow, Foster was not
      hanged until March 21, 1873. On March 21 and 22 the New York <em>Daily Graphic</em> devoted pages to pictures and stories of Foster's last
      hours.<a href="#r2">[back]
