   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00621_n1">1. This later dates to March 4,
      1873. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter March 4, and Richard Maurice
      Bucke added the year 1873. Edwin Haviland Miller cited the date in Louisa's hand
      and Bucke's assigned year (see Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:370). Louisa's letter reports one from granddaughter Manahatta "Hattie"
      Whitman, which was written since the recent death of her mother, Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman. Mattie, the wife of Thomas Jefferson, Walt's brother, died on
      February 19, 1873.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00621_n17">2. See Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's  ("last saturday") letter
      to Walt Whitman, and see Walt's 
      letter to Louisa, in which he enclosed payment for Edward Whitman's
      board.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n3">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00621_n4">4. Walt Whitman directed his
      letters for his mother to George Washington Whitman at Star's Foundry (Walt
      wrote "Starr's"). He instructed Manahatta "Hattie" Whitman, Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's daughter, to direct letters for her grandmother to Star's Foundry as
      well. See Walt's  letter to
      Hattie.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00621_n5">5. See Walt Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n6">6. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00440_n3">7. Manahatta Whitman
      (1860–1886), known as "Hattie," was the daughter of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven years of her life in
      the same home with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was especially close to her
      grandmother. Hattie and her younger sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957) were
      both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00621_n9">8. Manahatta Whitman's "papa"
      was Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman (1833–1890), Walt Whitman's favorite
      brother. Jeff married Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman in 1859, and Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman had shared their Brooklyn residence until Jeff departed for St.
      Louis, where he in 1867 became Superintendent of Water Works and become a
      nationally recognized name. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00619_n6">9. Jessie Louisa "Sis" Whitman
      (1863–1957) was the younger daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman,
      Walt Whitman's brother, and his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. Jessie
      Louisa inherited the nickname "Sis" after older sister Manahatta became "Hattie"
      and was sometimes called "Duty," but Walt often called her by the nickname
      "California." <a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00621_n8">10. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman's wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman died on February 19, 1873.
      Shortly after her death, Jeff and daughters Manahatta "Hattie" and Jessie Louisa
      went to live with Mary Moody and Philemon C. Bulkley. See Hattie's February 27,
      1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Library of Congress) and Jeff
      Whitman's February 24, 1873 letter to Louisa Whitman (Dennis Berthold and
      Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of
         Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press,
      1984], 158–160; 160, n. 5).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n6">11. Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975), 10–11.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00614_n8">12. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman died on February 19, 1873 from complications associated with a throat
      ailment. Mattie and her husband Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman had two
      daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved
      to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
      emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa. For more on Mattie,
      see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha
         Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      1–26. Waldron reports that a physician identified the cause of death as
      cancer (3). Robert Roper has speculated that Mattie's accompanying bronchial
      symptoms may have been associated with tuberculosis (<em>Now the
         Drum of War</em> [New York: Walker, 2008], 78–79).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00621_n14">13. In January 1873, Walt
      Whitman suffered a paralytic stroke that made walking difficult. He first
      reported it in his  letter to his
      mother and continued to provide regular notes on his condition. By mid-March
      Whitman was taking brief walks out to the street and began to hope that he could
      resume work in the office (see his 
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman).<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00621_n16">14. After her move to Camden,
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman corresponded regularly with Abby Price's daughter
      Helen Price in Brooklyn. Walt Whitman and Louisa knew Abby and her husband
      Edmund Price from their move to Brooklyn in 1856. During the 1860s, Abby Price
      and her family, especially Helen, were friends with Walt and his mother. Helen's
      reminiscences of Walt Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's
      biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay,
      1883), and she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters to her
      mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169). Twelve of
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters to Helen are held by the Morgan Library and
      Museum. For more on Abby Price's relationship to Walt, see Sherry L. Ceniza, <em>Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers</em>
      (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1998), 45–95.<a href="#r14">[back]
