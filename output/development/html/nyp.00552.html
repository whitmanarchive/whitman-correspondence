      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>If you feel like it write me soon as convenient after rec'ing this, as it is quite
      a
      while since I have heard from you, &amp; I am getting anxious.<sup><a href="#nyp.00552_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Nothing very different with me—I go out by my own
      volition not at all, as my power of walking &amp;c. is quite gone. I only get from
      one room to another in the house, with effort &amp; very slowly—I drive out
      fair mid-days—Sleep tolerably—appetite good—digestion
      so-so—
   </p>
   
   <p>I write (prose pieces) from time to time yet—have one ab't "Burns" in <em>N. A. Review</em> for November—(they pay quite well, &amp;
      Redpath is very good to me)<sup><a href="#nyp.00552_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Have a paper "My Book
      &amp; I" in <em>Lippincott's</em> for Jan. next<sup><a href="#nyp.00552_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—will send it you in printed slip—Shall
      probably get ready my little concluding book "November Boughs" this winter or next
      spring—I enclose Dr Bucke's last, just rec'd—the <em>Heine</em> extract it is possible I rec'd from you, but think not<sup><a href="#nyp.00552_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I found it very interesting. Best Love as always—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
