   <p>The T[ribune] &amp; your Monday's letter came<sup><a href="#nyp.00466_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—wonder if A[nthony] C[omstock] don't feel the Knout &amp; the blood
      trickling—the <em>reader</em> almost does—<em>Specimen Days</em> is all in type &amp; receiving the finishing
      touches—is to be on the market the 15th<sup><a href="#nyp.00466_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—will
      send you the earliest copy I can get—two moist, hot, close, unhealthy days
      here—but as I write the breeze is beginning to spirt up, lively &amp;
      cool—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00466_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd Sept 20." It is addressed: Wm D. O'Connor | Life Saving Service Bureau |
      Washington D C. It is postmarked: Camden | Sep | 3 | 6 PM | N.J.; Washington,
      D.C. | Sep | 4 | 4 AM | 1882 | Recd.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00466_n2">2. On  O'Connor informed Whitman that his reply
      to Comstock, "Mr. Comstock as Cato the Censor," had appeared in the New York <em>Tribune</em> on the preceding day. Only his opening sentence
      had been deleted: "Mr. Anthony Comstock's hostility to the nude—of which
      an illustrious instance was his famous prosecution of three unfortunate women,
      whom he had hired to dance before him for over an hour, without clothing, in a
      New York brothel—appears to extend to even the naked truth" (Clara Barrus,
      <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New
      York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931], 225). See also <em>Walt Whitman
         Review</em>, 5 (1959), 54–56.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00466_n3">3. On September 26 Whitman
      wrote in his Commonplace Book: "'Specimen Days' done," but it was not
      distributed until October 1 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
