   <p>In your letter to me of Sept. '81, (herewith enclosed) you tallied all my several
      copyrights for "<em>Leaves of Grass</em>"—<em>except the 1860–61 edition
         of Thayer &amp; Eldridge, Boston</em>—saying that one was not "entered" in
      your office. I enclose it herewith to show that it was taken out regularly, &amp; is
      in existence.
   </p>
   
   <p>What I send now for is to ask you to enter that 
      edn
      
       for the extension of fourteen
      years further from expiration &amp; send me certificate of such entry—find $1
