   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00461_n10">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      dated the letter "September 11," and Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year
      1865. Edwin Haviland Miller cited Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:377). Because Louisa is in Burlington, Vermont, to visit her
      daughter Hannah Heyde at the time of this letter, it dates to September 11,
      1865.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00461_n13">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      left Brooklyn for Burlington, Vermont, to visit her daughter Hannah (Whitman)
      Heyde, on September 4, 1865 (see Thomas Jefferson Whitman's  to Walt). She remained longer
      than she anticipated and did not return to Brooklyn until October 17, 1865 (see
      Walt Whitman's  letter to Ellen M.
      O'Connor).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00461_n1">3. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., resided in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles L.
      Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. In this letter, Louisa refers to
      Heyde as the one she dislikes, and she labels him a "conceited fool." Louisa
      visited her daughter in September 1865 because Hannah and her husband had
      quarreled about "some women that Heyde had in his room" (see Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). According to Jeff's letter, Louisa informed Jeff that she intended to
      "bring Han home."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00461_n6">7. Though below she wrote the
      proper name "Burlington," Louisa Van Velsor Whitman erred here because daughter
      Hannah Heyde and her husband reside in Burlington, Vermont. She repeated the
      mistake, writing "Birmingham" instead of "Burlington," in her  letter and, after her return to
      Brooklyn, in a  letter. Burlington
      is on Lake Champlain, across from Port Kent, New York. Vermont has no city or
      town named Birmingham.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00461_n8">8. The "young ones" are
      Manahatta "Hattie" Whitman (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" Whitman
      (1863–1957), the daughters of Jeff and Mattie Whitman. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman shared the Portland Avenue home with Jeff's family and often had the
      responsibility of caring for Hattie and Sis.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00461_n9">9. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      appears to have written "gramatical phrases," but the meaning of the expression
      is unclear. If a nonce coinage, she may intend the phrase as a euphemism for
      "dramatical phases," the periodic conflicts between Hannah and Charles L.
      Heyde.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n3">10. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r10">[back]
