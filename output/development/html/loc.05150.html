      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been from home for a week attending a murder trial near Montreal so your note
      of 13<u>th</u> lay waiting for me,
      got home day before yesterday and have gone over R's translation<sup><a href="#loc.05150_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> carefully, it is
      excellent, very literal, language very simple (as it should be) and reads (in the
      German) I should say fully as well as in the English. He has taken one liberty and
      only one—in English the last line reads
      "And may be just as much as the
      seasons."
      This line he translates
      "Und sein was die Jahreszeiten sind."
      Literally
      "And may be that which the seasons are." 
      This change, although a
      little bold, does not strike me as a bad one, though I do not see why he did not
      read
      "Und sein so Viel als die Jahreszeiten sind."
      "And may be as much as
      the seasons are." 
      However there is no doubt the translation is good and there
      may be (and doubtless is) a good reason for his reading of the last line. I am not
      a
      good enough German scholar to appreciate very fine shades of meaning or of language.
      I wish to goodness R. w<u>d</u> hurry
      up and give us a vol. of L. of G. in German, I should like immensely to see it in
      that dress. I wish you would speak to M<u>c</u>Kay about the circulars he
      was to print for me in re my vol. "W. W." (he told me you had consented to write 
      said circular).<sup><a href="#loc.05150_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> I am constantly getting letters asking me about the book and a
      circular would be a better &amp; more convenient answer than a letter. <u>N. B.</u> "Leaves of Grass" "Specimen Days &amp; Collect" and
      "Man's Moral Nature" should all be mentioned in circular—also the English
      publishers of <u>each</u> of these books should be specified.
      [illegible] I wonder
      whether M<u>c</u>Kay has an English
      house yet for "W. W."? I wish you would have this circular got out and at least 500
      copies sent me as soon as possible. We are all well here, I am up to my eyes in
      work, have to write my annual report in the next two weeks
   </p>

   <p id="loc.05150_n2">1. Thomas W. H.
      Rolleston's translation of selections from Whitman was revised by Dr. Karl
      Knortz and published as <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> (Zurich:
      Verlags-Magazin, 1889).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.05150_n3">2. There is no evidence in
      either Whitman's Commonplace Book or in the letters that Whitman agreed to this
      request (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). There is, however, a
      publisher's advertisement for <em>Man's Moral Nature</em> in <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883),
