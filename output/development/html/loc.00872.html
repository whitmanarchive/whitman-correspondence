      <br></br><br></br>My dear Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I find your book and cordial letter, on returning home from a lecturing tour in New
      York, and heartily thank you for both.  I have had the first edition of your Leaves
      of Grass among my books, since its first appearance, and have read it many times.
      I may say, frankly, that there are two things in it which I find nowhere else in literature,
      though I find them in my own nature.  I mean the awe and wonder and reverence and
      beauty of Life, as expressed in the human body, with the physical attraction and delight
      of mere contact which it inspires,and that tender and noble love of man for man which once certainly existed, but now
      almost seems to have gone out of the experience of the race.  I think there is nothing
      in your volume which I do not fully comprehend in the sense in which you wrote; I
      always try to judge an author from his own standpoint rather than mine, but in this
      case the two nearly coincide.  We should differ rather in regard to form than substance,
      I suspect.  There is not one word of your large and beautiful sympathy for men, which
      I cannot take into my own heart, nor one of those subtle and wonderful physical affinities
      you describe which I cannot comprehend.  I say these things, not in the way of praise,
      but becauseI know from my own experience that correct appreciation of an author is less frequent
      than it should be.  It is welcome to me, and may be so to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I did not mean to write so much when I commenced, and will only say that I will be
      in Washington on the 27th—only for that night—and would be very glad if we can come
      together for awhile after my lecture is over.  I am afraid I shall not arrive in time
      to call at the Dep't before the lecture, but if I can I will.  If not, will you either
      come to Willard's or tell me where to find you, and oblige
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Bayard Taylor (1825–1878),
      translator of Goethe's <em>Faust</em>, journalist, and traveler,
      sent his "Picture of St. John" to Whitman on . He commended Whitman's "remarkable powers of expression" and
      "deep and tender reverence for Man." His letter of  was even more unreserved in its praise. Later
      Taylor's response to Whitman was to change dramatically. In <em>The Echo Club</em> (2d ed., 1876), 154–158, 168–169, Taylor
      burlesqued Whitman's poetry. William Sloane Kennedy lists him among Whitman's
      "Bitter and Relentless Foes and Villifiers"; see <em>The Fight of
         a Book for the World</em> (West Yarmouth, MA: The Stonecroft Press, 1926),
      288. See also the letter from Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman of .
