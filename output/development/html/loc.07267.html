   <p>Your welcome letter conveying the good news that you are "feeling better still" is
      just to hand. You will have got mine before now telling you I had heard from Wm Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; that all was O.K., there
      was a line yesterday from him to Matilda Gurd<sup><a href="#n6145" id="r3">3</a></sup> but nothing special in it. All is
      right but move slower than we figured on. I am real glad you seem pleased with Ed
      
      W.<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r4">4</a></sup> I knew he would suit you or I would not have sent him so far—he was with me
      here a long time and I know him well—he is just what he looks a good, simple
      minded, quiet, honest country boy—just the kind you like. (A note just came
      from Wm Gurd—all well but not yet able to fix a date for me to
      go East). Yes I got the Phila "Times" 27 Oct. only a
      middling notice—it is suprising to me how little the average reviewer
      sees—not one of them seem to have the lest idea what you have been driving at
      this last 35 years—guess it will come all right in the end. Rolleston<sup><a href="#n1027" id="r5">5</a></sup> has sent me a copy of his Epictetus (Camelot Series)<sup><a href="#loc.07267_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup>—it is exactly what I wanted I have been looking it
      over and am delighted with it. Have not yet written to thank him, shall very soon.
      I
      guess you are going to make more of a recovery than any of the doctors
      suspected—they did not allow enough for that wonderfull physique of
      yours—I wish Pardee<sup><a href="#n4274" id="r7">7</a></sup> &amp; O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r8">8</a></sup> were making as good a flight—have heard nothing from

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4284">2. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was

      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert

      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
