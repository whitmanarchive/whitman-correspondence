      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend:—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope the Rhys<sup><a href="#pri.00009_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> brothers have not gone to the bottom! It
      begins to fill me with 
      alarum
      
       that we do not hear from the Croma<sup><a href="#loc.02912_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> in wh. he
      sailed. 
   </p>
   ———
   
   <p>I went in H. Williams &amp; Everetts<sup><a href="#loc.02912_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> this evening after
      work, &amp; passed a few rapt moments in looking at the bust of you which is
      handsomely mounted on a polished wood tall pedestal standing on the middle landing
      of the stairs &amp; just before a pier glass mirror—The very best position in
      the rooms. I then saw  that I had not really seen it at all in the right
      way—before (I mean) it was on a pedestal &amp; viewed at a distance. I gave it
      draining regards that fixed it in my mind. I regard it as a noble work, &amp; am
      very glad of this rich honor done to my poet, &amp; I want to congratulate Morse
      very heartily on it. It is a fine, nay a great, work, in my opinion.
   </p>
   
   <p>It seems to me that the chief traits that emerge are <u>compassion</u> blended with <u>alert curiosity</u>.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I don't know whether it strikes others so, or whether you 
      w<u>d</u>
      
       want these traits emphasized so much. I do see too, in some measure, the
      far forward look you spoke of in 
      yr
      
       good letter to me. But I think Morse<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r4">4</a></sup> might put more
      of the prophet or seer in it, or another one possibly.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mrs. Fairchild<sup><a href="#har.00049_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; her husband are going to drive out
      &amp; see my Cox photo, some time.<sup><a href="#loc.02912_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I suppose Baxter has written you that we have written to 
      Bost. Pub. Lib.
      
       about acceptance of bust.<sup><a href="#loc.02912_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup> They have a little
      gallery of sculpture—as I now remember, &amp; it will be a good place for it.
      Though <u>I</u> preferred the art museum.  But Baxter likes to have his own
      way always.<sup><a href="#loc.02912_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I must ask him about his <u>Herald</u> notice of it. For we must
      draw attention to it. He seems to have acted on Sidney M's suggestion 
      abt
      
       Williams &amp; Everett's being a better place than Chase's.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pri.00009_n1">1. Ernest Rhys
      (1859–1946) wrote on : "Let me
      say simply in a young man's way to you who are an old man now, how dearly and
      earnestly I think of you across the sea to-night, remembering the Past, looking
      on to the great to-morrow, for perhaps of all young men you have helped me most
      powerfully &amp; perfectly." On  Rhys
      proposed a one-shilling edition of Whitman's poetry in <em>The
         Canterbury Poets</em> series. On  Rhys wrote for the third time after waiting "for a reply
      so far in vain," and included the payment from Walter Scott, the English
      publisher of <em>The Canterbury Poets</em>. On Rhys's letter
      Whitman wrote: "the little English selection from L. of G. is out since, &amp;
      the whole edition (10,000) sold." For more information about Rhys, see Joel
      Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.02912_n4">2. The <em>Croma</em> was a Monarch line steamer operating between England and the
      U.S. in the 1880s.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02912_n1">3. Williams &amp; Everetts
      (1855–1907) was a Boston art dealership run by Henry Dudley Williams
      (1833–1907) and William Everett (1821–1899), two brothers-in-law,
      and their sons.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0862">4. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="har.00049_n3">5. Elizabeth Fairchild was
      the wife of Colonel Charles Fairchild, the president of a paper company, to whom
      Whitman sent the Centennial Edition on March 2, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). He mailed her husband a
      copy of <em>Progress</em> in April, 1881, shortly after his visit
      to Boston, where he probably met the Fairchilds for the first time (Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02912_n2">6. On the April 15, 1887,
      Whitman had sat for the photographer G. C. Cox of New York. Kennedy's photo
      appears to be lost.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02912_n5">7. The Boston Public Library
      turned down the offer of the bust. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927) was on the
      staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met Whitman for
      the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston in April,
      1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns in praise of
      Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for the poet. For
      more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02912_n3">8. A reference to Sidney
      Morse's 1887 clay bust of Whitman—apparently the poet's favorite depiction
      of himself at the time. A photo of it would later become the frontispiece of
      Horace Traubel's 1889 <em>Camden's Compliments to Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay), one of the first print-collections
      of Whitman's letters, addresses and notes.<a href="#r8">[back]
