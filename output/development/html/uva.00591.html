   <p>I continue getting along pretty well considering—Eat my rations &amp; sleep
      fairly—(the Graham biscuits taste good—have them most every meal—I
      only take two meals daily)—the publisher got an order for 250 copies <em>Nov: Boughs</em> yesterday from Scotland<sup><a href="#uva.00591_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—the enclosed (I send to George)<sup><a href="#n0700" id="r3">3</a></sup> was forwarded to me by Capt. Wright<sup><a href="#uva.00591_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—(I don't know what he wants George's address for—have not written
      myself)—Coolish, dark, rainy here to-day—I am sitting here yet by the
      stove in my sick room. The big book (all my writings collected complete)<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r5">5</a></sup> will be
      done in ab't a fortnight—I shall send you one—

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      publisher (see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.17.html">Saturday, November 17, 1888</a>). See also Whitman's , letter to William Sloane

   <p id="n0700">3. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="uva.00591_n3">4. Possibly Colonel John
      Gibson Wright, the commanding officer of George's regiment during the war. See
      footnote 4 in Whitman's , letter
      to Ellen M. O'Connor. See also his ,
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">5. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
