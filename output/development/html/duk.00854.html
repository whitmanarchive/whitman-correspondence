   <p>Heat, heat, heat, night &amp; day—I find Evn'g a great relief—have pass'd

      thanks to both—I suppose O'C[onnor]<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> is in Wash'n, very

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00854_n1">1. William Morlow
      Fullerton's eulogistic two-column review apparently appeared in the <em>Sunday Record</em> and then was reprinted on July 20 in the
      Boston <em>Advertizer</em> (Charles E. Feinberg Collection, the
      Library of Congress). Fullerton thanked Whitman on  for some photographs and pamphlets. The article by "Mrs. E."
      has not yet been identified, but it was probably written by Mrs. Elizabeth
      Fairchild. On July 5 the Boston <em>Herald</em> copied from the
      Providence <em>Journal</em> "The Whitman Craze," which mocked the
      Whitman clubs.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
