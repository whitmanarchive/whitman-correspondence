      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman Esq.<br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Father directs me to send to you $1.00 to pay for the Expressage on the watch
      sent 
      to day
      
      , the young man who sent it did not understand that it was to be
      prepaid.
   </p>
   
   <p>Since the Election has passed over, we Brooklynites have no other excitement of that
      kind till another Election but I suppose in Washington, sightseers are looking for
      the 4th of March to
      witness the inauguration of Grant. On which occasion as on all past inauguration
      days, Washington will I suppose present a lively appearance and if possible I am
      going after Consulting you &amp; the folks, to witness it. But I suppose that is too
      far off to speak of
      now.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">Regards from folks,<br></br>Yours very respectfully &amp;
      Truly
      <br></br>Alfred Wise.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Since the Correction of the watch it has run very well, the fault was with a
      rubbing of the hands against the dial or glass. Hope it will be satisfactory
      now!
