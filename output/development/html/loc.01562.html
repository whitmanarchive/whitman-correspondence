      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter has come to hand. According to request, I send you immediately a few hurr[ied]
      lines in response. 
      My dear loving boy, I wish things were situated so you could be with me, 
      &amp; we could be together for a while, where we could enjoy each others society &amp; sweet
      friendship &amp; you could talk freely. 
      I am sure it would do you good, &amp; it would be a great pleasure to me. But we must
      take things as they are. 
      I have thought over some passages in the letter, but will not at present say much
      to you on the subject, 
      in writing. One or two things I will say briefly at present—One is, that it is every
      way the best 
      &amp; most natural condition for a young man to be married, having a companion, a good
      &amp; affectionate wife—&amp; another is, that contentment with one's situation in life does
      not depend half so much on what that situation is, 
      as on the mood &amp; spirit in which one accepts the situation &amp; makes the best of it.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But these are bits of cold wisdom. I must put something to you better than that in
      my letter. 
      So I will cheer my boy [&amp;] tell you again, Benton, that I love you dearly, &amp; always
      keep you in mind, 
      though we are separated by hundreds of miles. Remember this, dearest comrade, 
      when things are cloudy with you, for it is true—&amp; such thoughts are often a balm &amp;
      comfort to the mind.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Write to me often as you can. Don't mind because we are separated now, as things are.
      
      We will meet one day, I have no doubt. Try to keep up the same brave heart in the
      affairs of peace, 
      that I know you did when you were a soldier. A young man's life is a battle any how.
      
      Noble—thrice noble is he who steadily carries throughout the march, through defeat
      or whatever happens, a gay, unconquered spirit.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The friendship of Walt Whitman
      with this former soldier can be reconstructed from Benton H. Wilson's
      letters in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection. On , Wilson recalled his confinement in Armory Square
      Hospital (as mentioned in Whitman's , letter to Lewis K. Brown), "when your kind face
      &amp; pleasant words cheered the soldier Boys &amp; won their hearts. I
      never shall forget the first time you came in after David &amp; I got there.
      We Loved you from the first time we spoke to you." In Wilson's first letter,
      written on , he began: "I
      suppose you will think that I have forgotten you long before this time but I
      have not, your kindness to me while in the hospital will never be forgotten
      by me." After a lapse in the correspondence, he wrote on : "I wish if aggreable to
      yourself to keep up a regular correspondence between us ... I think it will
      be of benefit to me morally, and perhaps will not be of any detriment to
      you." In this letter he admitted that he had just discovered that Walt
      Whitman was a poet. On , he
      informed Walt Whitman that he had been reading <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>, but complained: "I wrote to you a year and more ago that I
      was married but did not receive any reply, so I did not know but you was
      displeased with it"; he concluded the letter: "I remain as ever yourBoy
      Friendwith LoveBenton H. Wilson." Walt Whitman replied (lost), and
      sent <em>The Good Gray Poet</em>, which Wilson acknowledged on
      . On , after he informed Walt Whitman
      that his wife had gone to the hospital for her first confinement (the child
      was to be named Walt Whitman), Wilson complained: "I am poor and am proud of
      it but I hope to rise by honesty and industry. I am a married man but I am
      not happy for my disposition is not right. I have got a good Woman and I
      love her dearly but I seem to lack patience or something. I think I had
      ought to live alone, but I had not ought to feel so." On , Wilson acknowledged Walt
      Whitman's reply of : "I do not
      want you to misunderstand my motives in writing to you of my Situation &amp;
      feelings as I did in my last letter or else I shall have to be more guarded
      in my letters to you. I wrote so because you wanted me to write how I was
      situated, and give you my mind without reserve, and all that I want is your
      advice and Love, and I do not consider it cold lecture or dry advice. I wish
      you to write to me just as you feel &amp; express yourself and advise as
      freely as you wish and will be satisfied." On , Wilson wondered why Walt Whitman had not
      replied.<br><br>
      In his letter of , Wilson
      reported that he had moved to Greene, N. Y., but was still selling melodeons
      and sewing machines (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). On , Wilson informed Walt Whitman of
      his father's death two weeks earlier and related that his son "Little Walt
      ... is quite a boy now ... and gets into all kinds of Mischief." Benton's
      father, who "was insane at times," had written to Walt Whitman on , and on  (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection). Evidently Wilson wrote to Walt Whitman for the last time on
      June 23, 1875, when he wanted to know "what I can do to contribute to your
      comfort and happiness" (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York
      Public Library).
