   <p>Although I have written two or three letters to you, and Hattie one or two—yet we
      do not hear from you &nbsp;dear brother, are you too sick to write &nbsp;I had a letter from
      Mother yesterday in which she told me that you had been out a few times and once as
      far as the office—I hope you have not had a set back since then
   </p>
   
   <p>If you can I wish you would write me how you are and if you have any chance of getting
      out here this season—I wish you could come &nbsp;I think you would enjoy it and I know
      we would enjoy it hugely
   </p>
   
   <p>I fear from the way that Mother writes that she is not feeling very well—that she
      is not quite as happy as when she kept her own house—what do you think about it<sup><a href="#loc.00471_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall always feel sorry that Mother could not have come out here before Mattie died—she
      did want to see her so badly—for a week or two before she died she talked much about
      both of you and Mother and longed much to see you both—but it was not [to] be that
      she could see either of you
   </p>
   
   <p>I have felt quite anxious about you—as tis so long since I heard from you directly—I
      [hope] dear Walt you feel like writing, at least a short letter to me
   </p>
   
   <p>Hattie and Jess keep quite well and are as good as can be</p>
   
   <p>Write to me Walt</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00471_n1">1. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was in her final months of life, and some of her complaints undoubtedly
      resulted from fatigue and pain. She was also bothered by George's wife, Louisa,
      who talked of nothing "much but house and money" and who sent Edward Whitman on
      many errands but begrudged him his portion of butter. See Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman to Walt Whitman, March 24, 1873, and April 21, 1873 (Trent Collection of
      Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections
      Library).<a href="#r1">[back]
