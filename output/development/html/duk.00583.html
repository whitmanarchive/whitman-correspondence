   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00583_n11">1. This letter dates to
      September 23, 1869. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter September 23, and
      Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1869. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with
      Bucke's year (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). Bucke's year is corroborated
      by the letter's "old mrs turner" died; Margaret Turner at 120 Portland Avenue
      died on September 20, 1869.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00583_n5">2. Walt Whitman departed
      Brooklyn to return to Washington on September 15 or 16 (see Walt Whitman's  letter to his Washington
      friends).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00583_n9">3. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
      adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
      he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
      St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two
      daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters
      moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the
      position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment
      that would lead to her death in February 1873. For more on Mattie, see
      Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha
         Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      1–26."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00583_n8">4. Margaret Turner
      (1791?–1869), resident at 120 Portland Avenue, is described in her
      obituary as the mother of Father Turner, the Vicar-General of the Brooklyn
      Diocese, and a long-time resident of the city ("Obituary," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, September 23, 1869, 2). The place "where we used
      to live" is the longtime Whitman home on Portland Avenue near Myrtle, in which
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had resided with Thomas Jefferson Whitman and
      family.<a href="#r4">[back]
