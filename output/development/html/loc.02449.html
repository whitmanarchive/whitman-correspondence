      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Accept of my best thanks for your kind letter with the enclosed slips of your article
      on "Old Poets," which I received on the 13<u>th</u> inst. the
      article is one of great interest to me intrinsically; and extrinsically because of
      the rigorous mentality it evidences.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>By the same mail I received a letter form John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r1">1</a></sup> in
      which he says that he "spent two or three days in Camden, the latter part of Sept<u>r</u>" and found you "in pretty good condition" the best for
      three years he thinks—which is good news for all your friends here. He also
      says that he has sent your photo (from my negative) "back to England, to a daughter
      of Charles Kingsley's,<sup><a href="#n0137" id="r2">2</a></sup> who wanted one &amp; who is a reader and
      admirer of Whitman."
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>By the way I have not heard whether the negative reached you safely or not. If so
      I
      hope it may be of use to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I will send J. B. another photo of you. He considers it a most excellent one. He has
      an article with
      <u>North American Review</u> for Oct. on "faith and credulity"
      but I have not read it yet.
   </p>
   
   <p>Ingersoll<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r3">3</a></sup> had an article in the Sept number on "Tolstoi and the
      <u>Kreutzer Sonata</u>".
   </p>
   
   <p>I received a letter form Captain Nowell (from [
      <span class="unclear">Guccustown?</span>]
      ) respecting our commission &amp;
      his visit to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I conveyed your loving salutation &amp; benediction to J W Wallace<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r4">4</a></sup> and in a letter to me in which he tells me of certain worries &amp; troubles he
      says that it is "like a message of comfort from the skies" to him, &amp; he
      continues—"God bless <u>him</u>! Say I &amp; my grateful
      love accompany him always!"—I saw him this morning. He is looking pretty well
      and sends his love to you, as do all the friends whom I have met since receiving
      y<u>r</u> letter. At our last meeting (at the house of
      Wentworth Dixon) I read "The Carpenter"—at least the most of it—which
      took me nearly two hours, and much did they all enjoy that splendid story and the
      charming glimpses it gives of your personality &amp; influence—some of them
      being "fetched" by parts of it; and no wonder, for it is a most moving story and
      powerfully told. At next meeting (Nov<u>r</u> 17<u>th</u>) I shall read your letter &amp; your article to
      them.
   </p>
   
   <p>We have had some typical English November weather here lately—a good deal of
      rain and fog—but this has been a truly delightful day of gladsome, benignant
      sunshine—a welcome "halcyon days" before the winter settles upon us. I have just returned
      from the Bolton Chrysanthemum Show in our Town Hall where I have spent a very
      pleasant hour promenading, listening to the strains of our grand organ &amp; looking
      at the really fine display of gorgeously tinted bloom—quite a pleasant break
      in my professional work.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you are keeping better &amp; have quite got rid of the cough I have no
      cough—&amp; I have had none Warry told me of in his letter.
   </p>

      With best love to you &amp; kindest regards to all your household

      <br></br>Yours affectionately
      <br></br>J. Johnston
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>PS I enclose a newspaper cutting of the latest recorded instance of local
      bravery.
   </p>
   
   <p>I had a post card from Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r5">5</a></sup> asking me to get him a copy
      of the Sunday Chronical which contains the article upon you but I am sorry to
      say that it cannot now be obtained at the office. We have seen Dr. Bucke's letter in
      "The Conservator."

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_97.html">Johnston, Dr. John (d.1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0129">1. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0137">2. Charles Kingsley (1819–1875) was a novelist, a
      Church of England clergyman, and a controversialist.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0839">3. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6121">4. James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
