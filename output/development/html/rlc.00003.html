      <br></br><br></br>My dear Rudolf Schmidt<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n0793" id="r1">1</a></sup>,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My lonesomeness &amp; sickness here, (for I am still sick, &amp; here,) have been much
      rejoiced 
      to–day
      
       by my getting your good &amp; copious letter of 28th February, on your return to Kopenhagen. I rec'd with it the <em>Fatherland</em> with Mr. Rosenberg's<sup><a href="#n0519" id="r2">2</a></sup> criticism<sup><a href="#rlc.00003_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>—which (perhaps luckily for
      me) I cannot now read—but will one of these days have translated &amp; read to me. I
      keep it very carefully—as I do all you send me—&amp; shall yet read and commune
      with, &amp; dwell upon &amp; absorb <em>all</em> thoroughly &amp; at
      leisure—(especially your own review in the <em>Ide</em>.) I think
      probably <em>all</em>—certainly <em>most</em>—papers, sheets, &amp;c. you have sent me to Washington, have reached me
      here—the post office forwards them here—I rec'd two complete copies <em>Demokratiske Fremblik</em><sup><a href="#n0189" id="r4">4</a></sup>, &amp; one copy in sheets—also three copies picture paper <em>Folkeblad</em>, with my portrait,<sup><a href="#rlc.00003_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> which is most
      excellent—(and the notice I will have read to me)—I rec'd at the time, a year
      ago, the translation of Swedish and Norwegian poems, you sent me, acknowledged it,
      but the
      letter seems to have missed you, &amp; have read it &amp; had much pleasure, &amp; am to
      read it more—I also rec'd from Clausen your picture, which I have with me—&amp;
      prize. A friend lately looking at it said, "Why, he looks like a born Yankee—&amp; of
      the best." 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wrote you March 4th, acknowledging <em>Demokratiske Fremblik</em>, &amp;
      sent you (one in <em>Harper's Magazine</em>, &amp; one extracted in the N. Y.
      <em>Tribune</em>) my two latest pieces <em>Song of the Redwood
         Tree</em>, (California,) and <em>Prayer of Columbus</em>, which I suppose
      you have rec'd all—For the last ten weeks I have not felt inclined to write—have
      suffered in the head—walk hardly any, (from the paralysis,) but maintain good spirits,
      keep up in body &amp; face, (my brother &amp; sister said at dinner yesterday that portrait
      in the <em>Folkeblad</em> looks greatly like me now, &amp; has caught the true
      <em>expression</em> better than any of them.) In body I have always been,
      &amp; still remain, <em>stout</em>, in the American sense, (i.e. <em>not</em> corpulent)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In my letter of March 4 I wrote a few lines about Clemens Petersen<sup><a href="#rlc.00003_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup>—my only interview with him was about 40 minutes, one very
      rainy Sunday, nearly two years since in New York—he was just recovering from an attack
      of erysipelas which had left large red blotches on his face—two other visitors were
      just leaving—C. P. received me very kindly &amp; talked well—all was agreeable,
      but under the circumstances I could not say much nor stay long—received a pleasing
      but
      passing, &amp; not very pronounced impression—which is the reason, my dear friend,
      that I have not written more fully—Partly too I have been waiting expecting that
      perhaps somehow C. P. and I would meet again, &amp; talk more &amp; get better acquainted,
      &amp; I could write you further—but I have not seen any thing of him since—&amp;
      only seen some of his pieces casually in the magazines. I have not heard him or them
      mentioned here in America—certainly no essay in the <em>Atlantic</em>
      magazine nor any thing of his elsewhere in English that I have seen has attracted
      any
      special attention nor deserves it—shows nothing of the <em>forte</em> or
      heartiness of which I have no doubt he is capable—(I think your letter &amp; opinion
      of C. P.'s essay, of last summer, have missed me.)—I cannot understand your allusions
      to Bjornson<sup><a href="#rlc.00003_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup>—as you will be doubtless aware yourself. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The same <em>hardness</em>, crudeness, worldliness—absence of the
      spiritual, the purely moral, esthetik, &amp;c—are in Democracy here too—(though there are signs &amp;
      awakenings here very plain to me)—probably in Great Britain, &amp; in Europe &amp;
      everywhere—<em>Here</em>, it is much counterbalanced &amp; made up by
      an immense &amp; general basis of the eligibility to manly &amp; loving comradeship, very
      marked in American young men—but generally, I am the more disposed to be satisfied
      with the case as it is because I see that the only foundations &amp; <em>sine
         qua non</em> of popular improvement &amp; Democracy are <em>worldly &amp;
         material success established first</em>, spreading &amp; intertwining everywhere—<em>then</em> only, but then surely for the masses, will come spiritual
      cultivation &amp; art—they will then firmly assert themselves—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thank you for the graphic line–sketch you write of Bismark, in your letter. My own
      opinion is, that we can well afford—I will say, <em>such as you &amp;
         I</em>, can well afford, to let those little &amp; great <em>chunks of
         brawn</em>—Attilas, Napoleons, Bismarks—prepare the way, &amp; cut the roads
      through, for <em>us</em>.<sup><a href="#rlc.00003_n5" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Write me <em>here</em>, till further notice—let me hear what is said
      about <em>Vistas</em> or my poems—let me hear always of yourself fully. 
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0793">1. Rudolf Schmidt, a Dane and
      editor of <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em>, is credited with
      introducing Walt Whitman to Scandinavia by quoting translated passages from <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in a 1872 essay in his magazine. He wrote
      to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871:
      "I intend to write
      an article about yourself and your writings in the above named periodical which
      is very much read in all the Scandinavian countries. ... I therefore take the
      liberty to ask you, if you should not be willing to afford some new
      communications of yourself and your poetry to this purpose" (The Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0519">2. Carl Rosenberg was a friend of Rudolf Schmidt.
      According to Schmidt's , letter,
      an eight-column review of Walt Whitman's works appeared in the <em>Fatherland</em> (<em>Fædrelandet</em>): "The author of the
      criticism Rosenberg is a silly little fellow, who understands nothing between
      heaven and earth, and least of all, you" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). See
      <em>Orbis Litterarum</em>, VII (1949), 49<em>n</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="rlc.00003_n1">3. According to Schmidt's letter of , an eight-column review of Walt
      Whitman's works appeared in the <em>Fatherland</em> (<em>Fædrelandet</em>): "The author of the criticism Rosenberg
      is a silly little fellow, who understands nothing between heaven and earth, and
      least of all, you." Roos identifies Carl Rosenberg as a friend of Schmidt; see
      <em>Orbis Litterarum</em>, 7 (1949), 49n.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0189">4. Rudolph Schmidt translated Whitman's <em>Democratic Vistas</em> into Danish in 1871.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00003_n2">5. Walt Whitman's portrait, with an extract
      from Schmidt's essay, appeared in the <em>
         Illustreted
         
          Folkeblad</em> on February 22, 1874, according to Roos.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00003_n3">6. Whitman mentioned meeting Petersen in his
       letter to Schmidt. Schmidt
      pressed Walt Whitman for his opinion of Petersen, as in his letter of : "I have asked you at least two
      times how you did like Clemens Petersen; you have not replied and most probably
      you wont speak of this matter. If that is the case, I shall repeat the question
      no more."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00003_n4">7. Schmidt wrote at some length on  of Björnson: "His poetry
      comes from the source, that is throbbing in the people's own heart. He has been
      the spoiled darling of the whole Danish public. But he is a living test of the
      hideous and venomous serpent, that hides his ugly head among the flowers of the
      pantheistic poetry. You have in your 'vistas' spoken proud words of the flame of
      conscience, the moral force as the greatest lack of the present democracy. You
      have, without knowing it, named the lack of Björnson at the same time!
      Björnson owes Denmark gratitude. He has shown it in the form of deep and
      bloody offences, that make every honest Danish heart burn with rage and
      indignation."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00003_n5">8. On , Schmidt reported that he had seen Bismarck in Berlin: "It is
      worth the travel to get a glance on this so very 
      powerfull
      
       and so excessively beastly face. Attila called himself 'God's
      scourge,' Napoleon did not call himself so, but he was it. But Attila was
      imposing in the splendour of his barbaric greatness; of Napoleon the German H:
      Heine has said 'every inch a God.' A scourge like this Brandenburgider fox
      hunter mankind never has known. Perhaps mankind never has been so deeply
      fallen!"<a href="#r8">[back]
