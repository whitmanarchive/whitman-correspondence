   </p>
   
   <p>I should like to come over Saturday, be there about noon—will come up in the
      horse cars—will spend some hours with Mr. Clifford, &amp; if you come home early
      enough, and the weather good, we may have a (longer or shorter) drive, before
      supper—will leave the question of my stopping over Sunday, open.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="med.00715_n1">1. Edwin Haviland Miller,
      working from a transcript of this letter, identified the correspondent (see <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1964], 3:380). Whitman stayed at Smith's Germantown home from November 8 to 10
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Edward
      Clifford made a drawing of Whitman on November 3 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r1">[back]
