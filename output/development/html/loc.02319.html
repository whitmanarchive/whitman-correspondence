   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Josiah Hinton
      (1830–1901) was born in London and came to the U.S. in 1851. He trained as
      a printer, and, like the radical abolitionist writer and publisher James
      Redpath, went to Kansas and joined John Brown. In fact, but for an accident he
      would have been with Brown at Harper's Ferry. A man mistaken for Hinton was
      hanged. Together with Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Hinton also planned the
      jailbreak of John Brown's accomplices Albert Hazlett and Aaron Stevens in
      Charlestown for the "Jayhawkers," a band of abolitionists who assisted slaves
      through the Underground Railroad that included Silas S. Soule. With James
      Redpath he was the author of <em>Hand-book to Kansas Territory and
         the Rocky Mountains' Gold Region</em> (New York: J. H. Colton, 1859). Later
      he wrote <em>Rebel Invasion of Missouri and Kansas</em> (Chicago:
      Church &amp; Goodman, 1865) and <em>John Brown and His Men</em>
      (New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company, 1894). Apparently Hinton had suggested
      that Thayer &amp; Eldridge print <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (see <em>The New Voice</em>, 16 [4 February 1899], 2). Hinton served in
      the Union Army from 1861 to 1865, and saw Whitman while lying wounded in a
      hospital, a scene which he described in the Cincinnati <em>Commercial</em> on August 26, 1871. After the war Hinton wrote for many
      newspapers. He defended William O'Connor's <em>The Good Gray
         Poet</em> in the Milwaukee <em>Sentinel</em> on February 9,
      1866. Hinton's article in the Rochester <em>Evening Express</em>
      on March 7, 1866, "Farms and Fortunes in England and America," included a
      lengthy discussion of Whitman, with quotations from O'Connor and John Burroughs.
      Obviously pleased, Whitman sent it to friends, including William Michael
      Rossetti, who acknowledged it on 
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.28.html">Saturday, August 11, 1888</a>). See also Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.76.html">Friday, September 28, 1888</a>; William Sloane Kennedy, <em>The Fight of a Book for the World</em> (West Yarmouth, Massachusetts: The
      Stonecroft Press, 1926), 19, 67, 110–111, 242; and the <em>Boston Transcript</em>, 21 December 1901.
