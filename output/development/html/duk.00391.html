   <p>Your letters etc, to your sister are received—and have
      been duly handed to her—
   </p>
   
   <p>When I peruse her mother's<sup><a href="#n0705" id="r1">1</a></sup> letters to you, and note the
      infirmity of the hand, I experience considerable indignation at a daughter, who
      comparatively well, and having ample time and convenience, so far deliberately
      continues to neglect her obligation to the same, and in fact exhibiting [
      <span class="unclear">no?</span>]
       emotion.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But it is only a matter of a time, (or pecuniary considerations [
      <span class="unclear">how?</span>]
       much longer I shall
      tolerate the personal indignities I 
      recieve
      
      .
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To state the latest: this morning (Sunday) I got up and prepared my own breakfast
      as
      usual (and after having went over my garden (until 10 o'clock,  I quietly took a chair and sat down to
      enjoy a perusal of the New York Times. Han occupied another window, in her most
      negligent manner, peeping through the blinds at church goers; and because I did not
      look up at every remark and chafed some at the interrogation (which should have
      ceased) I was attacked with the usual personalities. I threw down the paper
      indignantly, and seizing my boots and coat retired to the kitchen, and shut the
      door, to escape further [
      <span class="unclear">provocation?</span>]
       and to prepare to leave the house.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But I was pursued there, and could not escape without forcing my way; but I came out
      of the encounter with the back of my right hand so badly lacerated by her nails,
      that I am compelled to bandage it. And this is from your gentle seeming, simple
      seeming sister,  who is
      so plausible and ductile before strangers—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I procured her a book from the library, last evening, for her Sunday's reading (a
      novel) and managed all for her comfort as well as I could.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>She wound up her most miserable outrageous 
      behaviour
      
       by mean inferences toward a poor child of a girl, who now lies 
      allmost
      
       at the point of death and whose has been declining for months—And
      whose brothers, [
      <span class="unclear">3?</span>]
      
      good, kind hearted men have helped me often (with material aid) in my struggles in
      this place.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I sent a flower to her, the other day, of a kind she had craved when she was in
      health, and a pupil under my care—And this was [
      <span class="unclear">referred?</span>]
       to—But it is a mean [illegible] subterfuge, and
      Han lies—knowingly—She knows how this family has befriended—But
      Han has  no gratitude
      within herself—and never had any sympathy for me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I never urged her to marry yet I have ever treated her in purest principle. I have
      nursed her in sickness, made every thing as agreeable and convenient as possible for
      her household work—taken half a woman's work upon myself. I have struggled
      within myself and solely. She is too mean. She is unjust—a liar, [
      <span class="unclear">slovenly?</span>]
       at times, without
      a parallel, for a woman without children. She is for herself, and herself only.
   </p>
   
   <p>I meet with much respect from the citizens of this place, and increasing
      encouragement—I shall exhibit my hand to a person, with whom she once lived.
      It will scarcely be credited, the persistent, vulgar and provoking meanness I have
      so long endured.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a French-born
      landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman (1823–1890), Walt
      Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_96.html">Heyde, Charles Louis (1822–1892)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
