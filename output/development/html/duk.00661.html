      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing new with me—I am well—Mother, I feel as if I wanted to come on
      there &amp; pay you a little visit—and as I can probably get off for a few days, I
      shouldn't wonder if I come soon. I think as I am likely to come quite a good deal,
      I would
      like in future to pay Sister Lou $1 a day for what time I stop there—I should feel
      better satisfied &amp; come oftener. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is quite cold here. I am wearing my overcoat—You see, mother, I am likely to prove
      a true prophet about Greeley<sup><a href="#duk.00661_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—He is not expected here at
      the White House next March. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother dear, I hope this will find you feeling comfortable—I will send you a line
      before I come—which will probably be within a week—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00661_n1">1. The executors altered the date to August
      13, 1872, because of the reference in Walt Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to a
      letter (now lost) sent on August 13, 1872. However, it is clear from Walt
      Whitman's remarks in this letter and in his  letter to George Washington Whitman and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      that Walt was planning a second visit to Camden. He had gone to Camden early in
      September, described in is 
      letter to Rudolf Schmidt.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00661_n2">2. Horace Greeley (1811–1872) ran
      against Ulysses S. Grant for the Presidency in 1872.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0700">3. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0368">4. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
