      <br></br><br></br>My Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The days are slipping away so pleasantly here that weeks are gone before I know it.<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      The Concord folk are as friendly as they are intellectual, and there is really no
      end to the kindness received. We are rowed on the beautiful river every day that it
      is warm enough—a very winding river not much broader than your favourite
      creek—flowing sometimes through level meadows, sometimes round rocky
      promontories &amp; steep wooded hills which, with their wonderful autumn tints, are
      like a gay flower border mirrored in the water. Never in my life have I enjoyed
      outdoor pleasures more—I hardly think, so much—enhanced as they are by
      the companionship of very lovable men and women. They lead an easy-going life
      here—seem to spend half their time floating about on the river—or
      meeting in the evening to talk &amp; read aloud. Judge Hoar says it is a good place
      to live and die in, but a very bad place to make a living in. Beatrice spent one
      Sunday with us here. We walked to Hawthorne's old house in the morning, &amp; in the
      afternoon to the "Old Manse" and to Sleepy Hollow, most beautiful of last resting
      places. Tuesday we go on to Boston for a week very loth to leave Concord—at
      least, I am!—but Giddy begins to long for city life again. And then to New
      York about the 5th 
      Nov. Herby told you, no doubt, that I spent an hour or two with
      Emerson—and that he looked very beautiful—and talked in a friendly,
      pleasant manner. A long letter from my sister in England tells me Per. looks well
      and happy &amp; is so proud of his little boy—and that Norah is really a
      perfect wife to him—affectionate, devoted, and the best of housewives. How
      glad I am Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> is painting you. I wonder if you like the landscape he is working on
      as well as you did "Timber Creek." Miss Hillard<sup><a href="#loc.04959_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> has undertaken the charge of
      a young lady's education, and is very much pleased with her task. She is in a
      delightful family who make her quite one with them—live in the best part of
      New York, and pay her a handsome salary. She has the afternoons and Saturday &amp;
      Sunday to herself.—Concord boasts of having been first to recognize your
      genius. Mr. Alcott &amp; Mr. Sanborn say so. Good-bye, dear Friend.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0259">1. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
