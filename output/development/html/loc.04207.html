      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pray forgive my long silence.<sup><a href="#loc.04207_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I have been deep in troubles of my own. All the books have arrived and been safely
      transmitted. Many thanks.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You have doubtless heard about affairs in England. The tone adopted by certain of
      your friends here became so unpleasant that I requested all subscriptions etc. to
      be paid over to Rossetti,<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r2">2</a></sup> and received no more myself. During a certain lawsuit against the Examiner, your
      admirers—notably Mr. Swinburne<sup><a href="#n0610" id="r3">3</a></sup>—pleaded against me that I had praised <em>you</em>, cited <em>your</em> words against me in court etc. I never was so shocked and astonished, for I would
      not have believed human beings capable of such iniquity.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I think I told you before, I shall ever regret the insertion of certain passages
      in your books (Children of Adam<sup><a href="#loc.04207_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> etc). I do not believe them necessary or defensible. These passages are quoted as
      being the work of an immoral writer, and, altho' I tried to show they were part of a system of philosophy, it would not do. I know
      the purity and righteousness of your meaning, but that does not alter my regret.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think your reputation is growing here, and I am sure it deserves to grow. But your
      fatal obstacle to general influence is the obnoxious passages. I wish you would make
      up your mind to excise them with your own hand.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>God bless you!—May your trouble lift, and may happy days be in store for you!—Let
      me know about your affairs. I may soon be in a position to help you more definitely.
   </p>

      Yours ever,
      <br></br>ROBT. BUCHANAN.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04207_n1">1. Robert Buchanan
      (1841–1901), a Scottish poet, novelist and dramatist, was an ardent
      supporter of Walt Whitman's works in England (see Harold Blodgett, "Whitman and
      Buchanan," <em>American Literature</em>, 2:2 [May 1930],
      131-40).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">2. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0610">3. Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) was a
      British poet, critic, playwright, and novelist. He was also one of Whitman's
      earliest English admirers. At the conclusion of <em>William Blake:
         A Critical Essay</em> (1868), 300–303, Swinburne pointed out
      similarities between Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly
      Rocking" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the
      most sweet and sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world." His
      famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America" is included in <em>Songs
         before Sunrise</em> (1871). For the story of Swinburne's veneration of
      Whitman and his later recantation, see two essays by Terry L. Meyers, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00740.pdf">Swinburne and Whitman: Further Evidence</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 14 (Summer 1996), 1–11 and "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00902.pdf">A
         Note on Swinburne and Whitman</a>," <em>WWQR</em> 21 (Summer
      2003), 38–39.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.04207_n2">4. Originally entitled "Enfans
      d'Adam" in the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, this
      cluster of poems celebrating sexuality was called "Children of Adam" in 1867 and
      thereafter. The poems, openly "singing the phallus" and the "mystic deliria,"
      were too bold for their time and often got Whitman into trouble. His
      relationship with Emerson cooled after he refused Emerson's advice in 1860 to
      drop the sex poems; in 1865 he lost his job in the Department of Interior in
      Washington for writing "indecent" poems; and he had to withdraw the 1881 edition
      of <em>Leaves</em> from publication in Boston when the Society for
      the Suppression of Vice found it immoral (<em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998]).<a href="#r4">[back]
