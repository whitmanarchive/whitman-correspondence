   </p>
   
   
   <p> You are very kind to remember Kennedy—yr son by adoption &amp; affinity—Nothing in the world makes me prouder
      than to merit in only a slight degree 
      yr
      
       esteem. My indebtedness to you—estimating values by all that makes
      life high &amp; noble—is simply boundless. Your confidential item 
      abt
      
       royalties also makes me glad &amp; wrings my heart at the same time. I
      cannot but think that the publisher has at least been negligent of 
      yr
      
       interests.<sup><a href="#loc.02604_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Walt will you let me pay you now
       $5. on that
      $13 I owe? The $13. is a pure <u>business</u> debt. $5000.
      represents my soul indebtedness to Walt Whitman, who is the only <u>god</u> I at present worship apart from the Universe as a
      whole 
   </p>
   
   <p> I can sympathize as to copyrights; I have not 
      rec'd
      
       a cent yet for my railroad book<sup><a href="#loc.02604_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—a year's
      sales—not having sold much over a 1000 copies. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I have passed civil service examinations (State, &amp; U
      S.) &amp; have a good prospect of soon getting position in the Custom House. May the
      gods be propitious! 
   </p>
   
   <p> I saw "The Voice of the Rain" quoted in newspapers here. I hear that it is
      considered by many one of the most exquisite things you have done. Popular &amp;
      sweet &amp; plain it is. Compare Tennyson's<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r3">3</a></sup> latest grind with it for an idea of
      sophistication <u>vs</u> grand simplicity. 
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p> Editor Baxter<sup><a href="#loc.02604_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> of Outing tells me that you think of visiting Boston soon, my most
      noble poet, &amp; I implore thee (as Whittier<sup><a href="#n1029" id="r5">5</a></sup> 
      wd
      
       say) to come &amp; see me for a week &amp; drink in our sublime prospect
      &amp; be soothed by our matchless rural quiet (flowers, birds, &amp; trees). 
   </p>
   
   <p> I see by the Critic, with some
      consternation, that the members of the esoteric Whitman Comradeship in London are
      making up a good-will offering to send to Walt W. Let 'em do it Walt. But I 
      shd
      
       suggest that the old way of 
      yrs
      
       be hinted to 'em i.e. to let 
      yr
      
       books go over there. Let 'em send their tribute if it will please them,
      but let them take a cargo of books from McKay in return. <u>That</u> is the way to do the square thing. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p> Here is a poet whose books are the delight of the finest minds in the world. He has
      earned &amp; deserves a far greater competence than such an elegant peculator as
      Longfellow.<sup><a href="#n0367" id="r6">6</a></sup> Let us all then, exert our energy in the attempt to spread a knowledge
      of 
      yr
      
       "new gladness &amp; roughness" wider &amp; wider. <u>That</u> is the business-like &amp; right way. You are defrauded of the wage
      of 
      yr
      
       life-labor otherwise. Damn it, what a mistaken blind, good bonhomme monster
      the people are!

   </p>
   
   
   
   <p> I shall be <u>grieved to the heart</u> if you dont come out
      &amp; see me, if you 
      shd
      
       come to Boston. This is 
      yr

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0625">3. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.02604_n3">4. Sylvester Baxter
      (1850–1927) was a newspaperman and urban planner from Boston. Besides
      writing for <em>Outing</em>, he also published in the <em>Boston Herald</em>.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1029">5. John Greenleaf Whittier
      (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
      slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
      surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
      Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
      volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (various publishers: 1906–1996) and Whitman's "My Tribute to Four Poets,"
      in <em>Specimen Days</em> (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh &amp; Co.,
      1882–'83), 180–181.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n0367">6. In his time, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
      (1807–1882) was both a highly popular and highly respected American poet.
      His <em>The Song of Hiawatha</em>, published the same year as <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, enjoyed sales never reached by Whitman's
      poetry. When Whitman met Longfellow in June 1876, he was unimpressed: "His
      manners were stately, conventional—all right but all careful . . . he did
      not branch out or attract" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906], 1:129–130).<a href="#r6">[back]
