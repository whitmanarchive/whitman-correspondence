      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother sent you a letter yesterday<sup><a href="#loc.00439_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—and a few moments afterward received one from you—Mother is getting quite around
      again—although I think she fails considerably—she is always quite bad mornings—it
      takes her some time before she can get around much &nbsp;When I got home last night Mat
      told me that during the afternoon Mother came up stairs crying as if her heart would
      break all on account of that lazy baggage Ed—Mother cant do anything with him—he wont
      wait on himself hardly and wont do the least thing for her—I think he is the most
      infernal lazy and the most ugly human being I ever met—unless something can be done
      he certainly will shorten Mothers life by years—I cant express the amount of work
      that he causes her—and the excitement and worriment he causes her every moment of
      her life
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I told Mother last night that if he could be boarded, somewhere that I would take
      her, that she should have a good room to herself and that Mat and I would do and provide
      for her in all respects as long as she lived and that she need not do another thing
      in the way of work, except for her amusement besides I would pay part of Ed's board
      &nbsp;She seemed to feel that if it could be done she would like it much—I sincerely wish
      that some arrangement could be made—for I greatly fear that Mother will not live long
      if she has to go on in this way—Walt wont you think over the matter and write me what you think could be done in the matter—
   </p>
   
   <p>If it wouldnt be too much trouble I wish you would write a letter to the young ones that sent you
      the money through Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00439_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—they are all awfully disappointed—they are all little girls of 8 and 12 years old
      (some even younger) and have been speculating what they should do with the letter—which
      one it would be directed to &amp;c—at last they settled it by agreeing that each one should have the letter for a week at a time in regular
      order—they have called to see Mr Lane several times to see if it had been received—They
      of course are too young to know that the great point was to give it and of course
      look for the praise that is usually bestowed. Did Lane explain to you that they were
      the children of the people that sent you money last winter a year ago—Durkee's, Crany,
      Lanes &amp;c &amp;c<sup><a href="#loc.00439_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &nbsp;they remembered hearing your letters read to their fathers and mothers, and heard
      a great deal of talk about the great good you could do with even a few dollars &nbsp;This
      fair they got up entirely among themselves and resolved in solumn conclave (after voting down resolutions to give to the Sanitary Com. Christian Com,
      &amp;c &amp;c) to send the money to you to be spent &amp;c &nbsp;Mattie and the children are very well—I
      am writing this at the office with Hattie at my side—she wants to send a kiss to Uncle
      Walt
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We do not hear from George &nbsp;I wonder why he don't write—I wish he would—Mother gets
      very down hearted—and a letter cheers her up wonderfully—you must write her as often
      as you can too—
   </p>
   
   <p>all send their love</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00439_n1">1. In her letter of June
      3, 1865, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman complained of suffering "considerable
      distress" from headaches (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare
      Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00439_n2">2. See Jeff's letter to
      Walt from .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00439_n3">3. These surnames also
      appear in the postscript to Walt Whitman's "The Great Washington Hospitals: Life
      Among Fifty Thousand Sick Soldiers.—Cases of Brooklyn Men" (<em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, March 19, 1863: 2). One of the children, Kate
      Lane, is the daughter of Moses E. Lane. A second is Willie Durkee, presumably
      the son of the man listed as "E. R. Durkee" in Whitman's postscript. The child
      of Charles E. Crary ("Crany" in Jeff's letter) has not been identified. As Jeff
      indicates, this was not the first time some of these children had contributed to
      Whitman's hospital work. On ,
      Moses Lane sent Whitman $15.20, including five cents from Willie Durkee and
      fifteen cents from Miss Kate Lane. Moses Lane commented that these contributors
      were the only ones "thus far that will have to deny themselves anything" on
      account of their gifts. Crany may have sent Whitman money in 1863 and 1864 (see
      Jeff's letters to Walt from  and ).<a href="#r3">[back]
