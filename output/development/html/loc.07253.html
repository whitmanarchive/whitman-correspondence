   <p>This is the tenth day of dark, cloudy, rainy weather and no signs of let up yet, but
      as far as I am concerned I like it first rate have a good hard coal fire in the
      grate in my office—everthing snug about me and sit there and see people &amp;
      write most of each day with considerable satisfaction. Wm Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      has gone to Detroit to see a man re meter he will probably go to New York early next
      week and as soon as he gets things in shape there  so that the patents are secure I shall go
      East and join him. We propose then to proceed to Philadelphia and show the m. to
      Harned<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> and to capitalists (show this please to
      Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup>). That is our scheme but it may be interfered with
      in many ways &amp; I can say nothing absolutely for certain. My annual report is
      nearly all in rough draft and some of it copied out—it will be considerably
      longer than any previous one—I am pegging away &amp; hope to get it completed
      and sent off before the end of next week.
   </p>
   
   <p>Hope to get a copy of "N.B."<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r5">5</a></sup> in a very few days—expect
      "C.W."<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r6">6</a></sup> will be something extra you are taking so much pains with it—it ought<sup><a href="#loc.07253_n2" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      to be something a little out of the common by which to do justice to its

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4284">2. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="loc.03745_n1">3. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel, was Horace Traubel's
      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="n3999">5. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus

   <p id="n4151">6. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
