      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Well here we are at Newport News, and glad enough to get out of the mud, in which
      the grand Army of the Potomac has lived moved, and had its being, ever since we first
      joined it.<sup><a href="#duk.00339_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> We arived here yesterday, and are encamped in a good dry place, and I hear we are to have new
      Tents in a day or two, so I think we will soon be nicely fixed.
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt if you have received the money from home, I wish you would send it on to me as
      soon as you can, as I think likely, that I will have a chance to go home (for 10 days)
      sometime next week. There is no Express Office here but it will come as far as Fortress
      Monroe which is 6 or 7 miles from here, and I will manage to go down there and get it. Probaly the best way would be for you to Enquire at the Express Office about what time, the
      money would reach Fortress Monroe, and write me, so that I will know when to go for
      it. I dont know, certain, that I can get, leave of absence, next week but I think my chances
      are pretty good, &nbsp;there is nothing sure about these things, you know, untill a fellow gets the documents in his fist. Of course we know nothing at all, about
      what they brought us here for, but I rather think I was right in the surmise (in my
      last letter to you) about Burnsides<sup><a href="#duk.00339_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> organizeing a force for a seperate command. Anyhow I am glad to get out of the Potomac Army for it seems as if it would
      never be able to accomplish any thing, &nbsp;And yet I believe it was as fine an Army (as far as their fighting qualities
      is concerned) as was ever seen.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well Walt I believe that I have nothing more to say, and as I am quite buisy to day getting things in shape I will stop writing and go to work. Good bye</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00339_n1">1. George is probably
      referring specifically to the "mud march" which began on January 21, 1863. After
      General Ambrose Everett Burnside's unsuccessful attempt to capture
      Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862, he finally persuaded Lincoln to approve the
      Army's crossing the Rappahannock River in a second attempt to take possession of
      the city. It resulted, however, in nothing except a wretched expedition in which
      the troops floundered in "floods of rain and seas of sticky clay without making
      any progress in its purpose of attacking Lee" (J. G. Randall, <em>The Civil War and Reconstruction</em> [1937], 315).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00339_n2">2. At the outbreak of the
      war, Ambrose Everett Burnside (1824–1881) organized the First Rhode Island
      Infantry. On January 25, 1863, Lincoln removed Burnside and put General Joseph
      Hooker (1814–1879) in command of the Army of the Potomac.<a href="#r2">[back]
