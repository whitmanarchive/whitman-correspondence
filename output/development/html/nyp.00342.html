      <br></br><br></br>Dear Nelly,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have had a succession of bad spells, (&amp; pretty close together) since I wrote
      the encouraging lines, some two or three weeks ago<sup><a href="#nyp.00342_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—indeed for a month now, in addition to other troubles, a pronounced
      pain &amp; distress in left side, growing intenser &amp; quite extended—often
      coming on at night, waking me up, &amp; keeping me from sleep all night
      afterward—But this morning as I write, (9 o'clock after breakfast—fish,
      Graham bread, tea, my appetite, though modified, by no means lost)—I feel
      quite <em>peert</em>, in good spirits, free from any marked
      distress—&amp; if you were to come in this minute, (than which, dear Nelly, I
      can think of no blesseder God-send,) you would say I appear in face, flesh, color,
      expression, &amp;c. <em>just the same Walt as of yore</em>—Will
      this good turn &amp; let-up of today (yesterday morning at this time I felt like
      death—&amp; thought of it—) be followed by other relapses?
      Probably—for so it has been now for nearly a year. And yet each time I cannot
      help fancying that <em>now</em> I am going to recuperate—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I write, sitting here in the parlor alone by the window, it is very
      pleasant—soothing—it is a sweet balmy, not hot morning—my
      sister's sister,<sup><a href="#nyp.00342_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> from Norwich, Conn. is here on a
      visit, with her little 8 months old babe-boy—She is walking in the other
      room, singing it to sleep, in her arms—she has a fine contralto voice, &amp;
      is singing beautifully, unconsciously—it does me good too—
   </p>
