   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n6000">1. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4250">2. Henry Bacon Lovering
      (1841–1911) held several political positions at state and federal levels.
      Lovering represented Massachusetts' sixth district in the U.S. House of
      Representatives between 1883 and 1887, and was appointed as the United States
      Marshal for Massachusetts by President Grover Cleveland in 1888. He later served
      as the United States Pension Agent at Boston between 1894 and 1898. Lovering was
      involved in efforts to get Whitman a government pension in recognition of his
      Civil War hospital service.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00830_n1">3. See the letter from
      Whitman to Sylvester Baxter of .
      On January 19, Walt Whitman noted the introduction of Lovering's bill, which was
      to grant the poet a pension of $25 a month (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On February 4 he replied to a letter
      from Lovering (Whitman's Commonplace Book); both letters are apparently
      lost.<a href="#r3">[back]
