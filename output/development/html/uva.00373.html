      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I merely write a line to call attention (lest it may be overslaughed in the rush of
      a great
      office) to the poem I sent you some days since, <em>Song of the
         Exposition</em><sup><a href="#n0577" id="r2">2</a></sup>—(will make a column &amp; a half close minion)—proposed to be
      printed, if at all, <em>in the paper for May 10</em>, if acceptable at the
      price named. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I believe I mentioned in my note at the time that it had also been sent to the <em>London Times</em> and <em>Chicago Tribune</em>—&amp;
      may, (or may not,) appear May 10, in them.<sup><a href="#uva.00373_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>

   <p id="n0577">2. "Song of the Exposition" (formerly called "After
      All, Not to Create Only") was published in 1871; see Whitman's , letter to the American Institute's
      Committee on Invitations and his , letter to the Roberts Brothers. Walt Whitman sent "Song of the
      Exposition" to the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> on May 5, 1876
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book). On May 10, 1876, the newspaper returned the
      manuscript because it arrived too late for publication (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00373_n2">3. In order to capitalize upon the formal
      opening of the Philadelphia Exposition on May 10, 1876, Walt Whitman sent the
      poem to various newspapers, among them the <em>Herald</em> and the
      <em>Tribune</em>. According to a notation on May 5, 1876, the
      price was $50 (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). "Song of
      the Exposition" (formerly called "After All, Not to Create Only") was published
      in 1871; see Whitman's  letter to
      the American Institutes's Committee on Invitations and his  letter to the Roberts
      Brothers.<a href="#r3">[back]
