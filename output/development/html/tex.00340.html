   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00340_n7">1. This letter has no date in
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Edwin Haviland Miller dated it "after"
      November 10, 1868 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:366). The source of Miller's
      date is Hannah Heyde's November 10, 1868 letter, which appears on the verso of
      Louisa's letter. Because Louisa was generally prompt about forwarding letters to
      Walt Whitman, this letter dates to between November 11 and November 14,
      1868.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n3">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="tex.00340_n2">3. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided
      in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a
      French-born landscape painter. The reason that Hannah's letter is "strangely
      connected" may be attributed to a thumb infection that led Doctor Samuel W.
      Thayer to lance her wrist in November 1868 and to amputate her thumb the
      following month (see Louisa's 
      letter to Walt Whitman; and see Charles L. Heyde's December 1868 letter to
      Louisa in Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint
         Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em>

   <p id="tex.00340_n8">4. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a French-born landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa
      Whitman (1823–1908), Walt Whitman's sister, in 1852, and they lived in
      Burlington, Vermont. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman often spoke disparagingly of
      Heyde in her letters to Walt, and Hannah's thumb infection and the surgical
      amputation strained relations further. On , she wrote, "i had a letter or package from charley hay three
      sheets of foolscap paper and a fool wrote on them."<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00575_n9">5. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
      adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
      he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
      St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Jeff
      Whitman. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta "Hattie"
      (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" (b. 1863). In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to join Jeff after he had assumed the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in 1867. For more on Mattie, see
      the introduction to Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University

   <p id="duk.00585_n1">7. Samuel W. Thayer, a
      Professor of Anatomy at the University of Vermont Medical School, performed
      surgeries in Burlington, Vermont during the 1860s. A serious thumb infection in
      late 1868 led Dr. Thayer to lance Hannah (Whitman) Heyde's wrist in November. In
      early December, he amputated Hannah's thumb. For Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      report to Walt Whitman on the initial surgery from a non-extant letter by
      Charles L. Heyde, see her  letter to Walt Whitman. Walt inquired of Dr. Thayer with regard

   <p id="duk.00425_n2">8. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
