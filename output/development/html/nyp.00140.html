      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I wrote to you some time since and have received no reply. Have you shuffled of this
      mortal coil and now roaming in the spirit-land? If so rapp and convince me of spiritualism.
      I have been unwell for some time back and the surgeons tell me liken unto die but
      I could not see it in that light  So deferred taking a red cedar box on this occasion.
      I am on the improve and will continue to do so until I am "Richard himself again"
   </p>
   
   <p>I have hoped to see you out in this dept now that the Ninth Army Corps has moved in
      this direction. Have you given over following the fortunes of the wandering Corps.
      I recieved a letter from Memphis some time since stating that they were on boats bound for Vicksburg
   </p>
   
   <p>Well Walt, I am ambitious and write consulting you. I see many Inspectors in the Army,
      some as to cleanliness and discipline of Hospitals others as to the ventilation etc
      etc I have met a number whom I consider inqualified for the position from the fact that they are not acquainted with Hospital life. My
      ambition points to this branch for myself I feel qualified for an inspector of Hospitals
      and I think can produce testimonials and certificates to that effect from officers
      of high standing in this Dept and in the Ninth Army Corps. Can you bring any influence
      to bear on this matter in the City of Washington. You will confer quite a favor by
      replying in regard to this question.
   </p>
   
   <p>Give my kind regard to Amos [Herbert]<sup><a href="#nyp.00140_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> and others of Campbell Hospital.
   </p>
   
   <p>The news in this Dept is meagre. Genl Rosencrans<sup><a href="#nyp.00140_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> is "marching on" Rumor to night reports the capture of Tallahomie [Tullahoma, Tennessee]
      with 18000 prisoners. I do not credit the report myself. I know there will be a fight
      ere long as the Hospl have orders to ship the wounded of the last battle to Louisville and make room for
      others. The Army of the Potomac "Oh my" what has to come of it I hope to hear of brilliant
      achievements in that direction.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00140_n2">1. Whitman saw Amos H. Vliet in
      the hospital tent at Falmouth on December 22, 1862, and mentioned him briefly in
      an article that appeared in the <em>Brooklyn Eagle</em> of March
      19, 1863 (Richard Maurice Bucke, ed., <em>The Complete Writings of
         Walt Whitman</em> [New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons 1902], 7:95–96).
      According to his diary (Charles I. Glicksberg, <em>Walt Whitman
         and the Civil War</em> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press,
      1933], 133), Whitman wrote a (lost) letter to Vliet on May 2, 1863.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00140_n3">2. William Starke Rosecrans
      (1819–1898) was a general in the Union Army during the Civil War. Though
      he was successful in several early campaigns during the war, he is most known
      for his disastrous defeat at the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863.<a href="#r2">[back]
