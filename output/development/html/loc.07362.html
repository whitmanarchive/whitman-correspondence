   <p>Thursday—we have just had dinner &amp; I have come in the front room by the
      fire—A deep snow everywhere outside, but comfortable here—the little
      canary bird singing blythely &amp; I feeling pretty well for me though indeed as the
      hymn says—"Old age is creeping on with its great load of sin."<sup><a href="#loc.07362_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I havn't heard from you or seen any of you in some weeks—hope everything goes
      on right—Hope you or George<sup><a href="#loc.07362_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> or both of you will come here
      soon &amp; spend some hours &amp; stay to dinner—Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r4">4</a></sup> spoke of it Thanksgiving Day—&amp; we both would be glad to have you both
      come yet—Everything goes now with me about as usual—have not been as
      well as usual the last month—send one of Herbert's<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r5">5</a></sup> last
      letters enclosed—Dr. B[ucke]<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r6">6</a></sup> speaks of Harry<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r7">7</a></sup> in his last and wants to know if anything has been

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07362_n1">1. Miller derives his
      transcription from a transcript held in The Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman at the Library of Congress. This letter appears to
      have been written in December 1887. Harry Stafford was having throat trouble at
      the time. Based upon Whitman's letters and the entries in Whitman's Commonplace
      Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.), Whitman's income in
      1887 amounted to at least $2,575.98, which includes: royalties, $131.91;
      lectures, $620.00; sales of books, $95.75; payments for articles and
      poems, $233.00; gifts, $1,421.32; and sale of photographs, $74.00.
      (As noted in the letter from Whitman to the Editor of <em>The
         Critic</em>, , the figures
      for book sales are conjectural, since it is assumed he charged a uniform
      price.)<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07362_n2">2. Whitman is thinking here of
      the hymn sometimes called "Calvary," beginning "Come, O my heart," with the
      lines "There is no time so good as youth, / To travel this mountain you must
      see, / For when old ages comes on, with its great load of sin, / How then canst
      thou climb up Calvary."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07362_n3">3. George Stafford was the
      father of Harry Stafford.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6113">4. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,

   <p id="n0262">5. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">6. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0590">7. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
