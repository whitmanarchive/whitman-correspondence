   <p>Yours of the—containing the two books sent me—is reed.<sup><a href="#loc.01297_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I have only glanced at them—&amp; am delighted with your natural &amp; robust
      style—and treatment of its great subjects men &amp; nature. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I reserve to myself a more leisure time
      for careful reading of your present. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I enclose my address at Yale University delivered before the Alumni &amp; whole
      College<sup><a href="#n4131" id="r3">3</a></sup>. As but 15 minutes were allowed, I have barely been able to state my views
      without discussion. So much the better perhaps—as our national failing is more talk
      than
      thought.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have but the moment to return you my thanks—I wish you all happiness. </p>
