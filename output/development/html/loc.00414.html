      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother recived your letter of last Tuesday, this morning<sup><a href="#loc.00414_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &nbsp;We were glad to hear from you &nbsp;indeed I began to think that the hospitals had got
      the better of you, as we had not heard in so long. I mailed you a letter from Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00414_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> to-day containing some money. I suppose Mr Lane would have written you before but
      he met with quite a serious accident last Sunday &nbsp;His little boy, abt 5 years old, fell from the balcony down in the area on the stone steps and hurt his
      head pretty bad. The Dr's hardly know how bad he is hurt, but think he will recover.
      Dr Ruggles<sup><a href="#loc.00414_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> who was called in says that it is hardly possible to say how it will go with him
      for abt 10 days &nbsp;It is a great blow to Mr Lane as he was his favorite child. I am in hopes that it
      is not so serious as we at first supposed. With us every thing is the same as usual.
      Mother is quite well &nbsp;Mattie is well yet but how long she will continue so is a question,<sup><a href="#loc.00414_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> she is getting along first rate. she has a young girl to help her do the house work
      and is in the best of spirits &nbsp;Hattie is getting along finely growing well and has
      perfect health. She has grown wonderfully since you left. I think you would hardly
      know her. A few days since she had quite a bad fall, or rather it might have been
      one but she luckily escaped without doing herself much harm &nbsp;She fell in the yard
      and hit her forehead on the little curb stones that are set on edge along the sides
      of the walks. She cut quite a gash in her forehead but it has entirely healed up and
      indeed hardly leaves any mark now
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We had a letter from George written abt the time that yours was<sup><a href="#loc.00414_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> &nbsp;I answered it at once. When you write to George tell him that I write him quite
      often although he does not seem to get them. Andrew thinks he will go down to Newbern
      the last of this week. He will go down with Jim Cornwell.<sup><a href="#loc.00414_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Andrew is going to take charge of the building of some fortifications I believe.
      Andrew's health is not good although I think he is better than he was and I think
      he would get well easy enough if he took better care of himself and did not drink
      so much. His family are all well. We or rather Mother had a <em>letter</em> from Heyde the other day reading thus &nbsp;"Your letter received. Han is better to-day
      than she has been for months—Charlie" &nbsp;That was all there was in it. Rather short
      and sweet wasn't it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are having what might be called first-class weather here to-day, athoug[h] we have
      had that same cold, damp North east wind that you spoke of &nbsp;Everything in the country
      looks well and I guess that we shall have large crops unless something unlikely occurs.
      We are anxiously expecting to hear from Vicksburg and begin to fear that it is going
      to turn out like the Victories of the Army of the Potomac although Grant aint in the habit of doing such things either.<sup><a href="#loc.00414_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> I hope and pray that he may be successful &nbsp;I cannot agree with you Walt in relation
      to the President. I think that he is not a man for the times, not big enough &nbsp;He dont seem to have even force enough to stop bickerings between his own Cabinet and Generals nor force enough to do as he thinks best.<sup><a href="#loc.00414_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> We begin also to fear that Hooker did not win a <em>very great victory</em> either or he would hardly lie idle so long during the best part of the year.<sup><a href="#loc.00414_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> No, A. L.<sup><a href="#loc.00414_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> is not the man and I hardly know if we have one that is equal to the thing. Write
      me &nbsp;you have almost forgotten me. All send their love,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00414_n1">1. Edwin Haviland Miller,
      ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77), 1:102–104.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00414_n2">2. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00414_n3">3. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his
      practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems"
      (<em>Correspondence</em> 1:90, n. 85).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00414_n4">4. Martha Mitchell
      Whitman, also known as "Mattie," was Whitman's sister-in-law and wife of his
      brother Jeff. She was in the last month of her pregnancy at this time.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00414_n5">5. Jeff apparently refers
      to George's letter of .<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00414_n6">6. James H. Cornwell was a
      first lieutenant in the 158th New York Regiment of Infantry. He was the
      quartermaster in charge of building fortifications at New Bern, North Carolina
      (Loving, 96, n. 5).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00414_n7">7. The siege of Vicksburg
      had begun May 22, 1863, and Jeff was apparently afraid that, win or lose, it
      would be as costly and indecisive a battle as those during the previous nine
      months at Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00414_n8">8. Walt Whitman enclosed
      the preceding three sentences in parentheses. Perhaps in a lost letter Walt
      conveyed to Jeff ideas about President Lincoln similar to those he offered to
      his friends Nathaniel Bloom and John F. S. Gray in March: "I think well of the
      President. He has a face like a hoosier Michael Angelo, so awful ugly it becomes
      beautiful....Mr. Lincoln keeps a fountain of first-class practical telling
      wisdom. I do not dwell on the supposed failures of his government; he has shown
      I sometimes think, an almost supernatural tact in keeping the ship afloat at
      all" (<em>Correspondence</em>, 1:82–83). Despite this and
      similar remarks, the poet's faith in Lincoln did occasionally waver. See <em>Correspondence</em>, 1:174, n. 19.<a href="#r8">[back]
