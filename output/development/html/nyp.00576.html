   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="med.00821_n1">4. In the August issue of <em>The Fortnightly Review</em>, Swinburne repudiated his earlier
      praise of Whitman. Apparently, a reporter named Davis from the Philadelphia <em>Press</em>, of which Talcott Williams was the editor,
      questioned Whitman on his reactions. The interview appeared in the <em>Press</em> on August 3, 1887.<a href="#r4">[back]
