   <p>Probably the two or three letters lately from me have sketch'd in the
      situation—Last night middling fair—the bulk, say from 12 to 4½, I
      must have slept hardly disturb'd—wh' was doing well—rose
      late—Ed<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r2">2</a></sup> comes in &amp; makes the fire—had a few
      mouthfuls of breakfast—very light—an hour later a bowel action pretty
      moderate—rather less irritation &amp; smartness &amp;c than previous
      days—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am sitting now in my big chair by the fire more negatively comfortable than you
      w'd
      suppose—Sunny, rather windy, pretty sharp cold—Mrs. Harned<sup><a href="#n4134" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; the new born boy are getting along so far
      splendidly—H.<sup><a href="#n4146" id="r4">4</a></sup> was here last evn'g—he has lost
      two cases (rather notable here)—two tavern keepers charged with selling liquor
      sunday—I keep on having applications for autographs, &amp; to read <em>MS</em> poems<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r5">5</a></sup>—have had five the last two days—cannot
      give any attention to them—generally dont read them thro—I have heard
      from Edw'd Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r6">6</a></sup>—a young Englishman, a friend of
      his, has just call'd—C is well, &amp; occupied ab't the same as
      before—(rather wishes to come to America, &amp; the mate &amp; wife he has
      been living with<sup><a href="#loc.07556_n2" id="r7">7</a></sup> wish the same for themselves.)
   </p>
   
   <p><em>After 4</em>—have been lying on the bed an hour or
      so—Sitting here now alone—quiet &amp; cold &amp; near sunset—wind
      shakes the window sashes—here comes my dinner—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4319">2. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert

      (1856–1914) was Horace Traubel's sister. She married Thomas Biggs Harned,

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4146">4. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel (1856–1914), was
      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on his relationship with Whitman, see

   <p id="n4151">5. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n0141b">6. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="loc.07556_n2">7. Carpenter lived with the
      farm worker and scythe-maker Albert Fearnehough and his wife and children, in a
      cottage near Sheffield, and then, after he built his house in Millthorpe in
      1883, Carpenter invited Fearnehough and his family to live there with
      him.<a href="#r7">[back]
