   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." For more information
      about Costelloe, see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n4151">4. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
