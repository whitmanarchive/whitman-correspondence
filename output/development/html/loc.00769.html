      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.00769_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letters of the 6th &amp; 7 have arrived, with timely contributions from D. L. Northrup,<sup><a href="#loc.00769_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> John H. Rhodes,<sup><a href="#loc.00769_n7" id="r3">3</a></sup> Thos. Cotrel,<sup><a href="#loc.00769_n8" id="r4">4</a></sup> Nicholas Wyckoff,<sup><a href="#loc.00769_n9" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; Thomas Sullivan,<sup><a href="#loc.00769_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> for my poor men here in hospital. With these, as with other funds, I aid all I can
      soldiers from all the states. Most heartily do I thank you, dear friend, for your
      kind exertions—&amp; those gentlemen above named—it is a work of God's charity, never
      cases more deserving of aid, never more heart-rending cases, than these now coming
      up in one long bloody string from Chancellorsville and Fredericksburgh battles, six
      or seven hundred every day without intermission. We have already over 3000 arrived
      here in hospital from Hooker's late battles. I work somewhere among them every day
      or in the evening. It is not so exhausting as one might think—the endurance &amp; spirit
      are supplied. My health, thank God, was never better—I feel strong &amp; elastic—an obstinate
      cold &amp; deafness some weeks, seems to be broken up at last. Yesterday I spent nearly
      all day at Armory Square Hospital. This forenoon I take an intermission, &amp; go again
      at dusk.
   </p>
   
   <p>You there north must not be so disheartened about Hooker's return to this side of
      the Rappahannock and supposed failure.<sup><a href="#loc.00769_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup> The blow struck at Lee &amp; the rebel sway in Virginia, &amp; generally at Richmond &amp; Jeff
      Davis, by this short but tremendous little campaign, of 2d, 3d, 4th &amp; 5th inst's,
      is in my judgment the heaviest and most staggering they have yet got from us, &amp; has
      not only hit them nearer where they live than all Maclellan ever did, but all that
      has been levelled at Richmond during the war. I mean this deliberately. We have I
      know paid for it with thousands of dear noble lives, America's choicest blood, yet the late battles
      are not without something decisive to show for them. Hooker will resume operations
      forthwith—may be has resumed them. Do not be discouraged. I am not even here—here
      amid all this huge mess of traitors, loafers, hospitals, axe-grinders, &amp; incompetencies
      &amp; officials that goes by the name of Washington. I myself yet believe in Hooker &amp;
      the A[rmy] of P[otomac]—yet say he is a good man.
   </p>
   
   <p>Jeff writes me about your boy Horace Tarr,<sup><a href="#loc.00769_n5" id="r8">8</a></sup> 20th Connecticut. I will endeavor to make immediate inquiry about him—there are some
      of the 20th Conn. here in hospital—will write you forthwith, if I get any information.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have written to Nicholas Wyckoff,<sup><a href="#loc.00769_n6" id="r9">9</a></sup> to your care, a hospital &amp;c. letter.
   </p>
   
   <p>Love &amp; thanks to you, dear friend, &amp; to those who are aiding my boys.<sup><a href="#loc.00769_n100" id="r10">10</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00769_n2">1. See Whitman's letter from
      
      . Moses Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
      and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter of
      , and later various sums which
      Whitman acknowledged in letters from , , and . In his letter of , Lane pledged $5 each month. In an
      unpublished manuscript in the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York
      Public Library, Whitman wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed
      quite a large sum of money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in
      Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works
      there.)" Lane assisted Whitman in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from
      , and ). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal
      welfare that on , he sent through
      Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00769_n1">2. Daniel L. Northrup was a
      member of the Brooklyn Water Commission.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00769_n7">3. John H. Rhodes was a water purveyor in
      Brooklyn.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00769_n8">4. Thomas Cotrel or Cottrell (1808–1887) occupied various positions in the Brooklyn city
      government, including (in 1863) clerk of the water construction board. Cotrel later
      moved west, dying in Alameda, California, on January 14, 1887. Thanks to Walter Stahr
      for contributing this information about Cotrel, his ancestor.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00769_n9">5. Nicholas Wyckoff was the
      president of the First National Bank of Brooklyn. <a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00769_n3">6. Thomas Sullivan is unidentified.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00769_n4">7. On May 8, 1863, the <em>New York Times</em> reported that Hooker was rumored to have
      retired to the northern side of the Rappahannock River. It would seem as though
      Whitman were anticipating Jeff's letter of : "Of course we all feel pretty well down-hearted at the news but
      then we try to look on it in the most favorable light. God only knows what will
      be the next. I had certainly made up my mind that we should meet with partial
      success certainly, but it seems otherwise."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00769_n5">8. Jeff wrote in his , letter to Walt that Lane was concerned
      about the whereabouts of his nephew Horace G. Tarr, a lanquet-major. On , Jeff informed his brother that "Lane
      is again very anxious about his boy."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00769_n6">9. But see the letter from
