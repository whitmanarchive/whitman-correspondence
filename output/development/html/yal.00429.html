   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00429_n1">1. This letter bears the
      address: Henry A Beers | New Haven | Conn:. It is postmarked: Kirkwood | May |

   <p id="yal.00429_n3">2. Beers (1847–1926)
      was a poet and professor of English literature at Yale. On May 16 he wrote to
      thank Whitman for quoting his verses in <em>The American</em> on
      May 14: "To a young writer, uncertain of himself, the slightest notice from an
      older &amp; distinguished brother in the craft is very precious. . . . because
      it gives him heart in his work" (The Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
      Beers in 1898 termed Whitman "a great sloven" (see William Sloane Kennedy, <em>The Fight of a Book for the World</em> [West Yarmouth, MA: The
      Stonecroft Press, 1926], 136). Similar reservations appear in his <em>Four Americans</em> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1919),
      85–90.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="yal.00429_n2">3. Whitman was at Glendale
      from May 13 to 26 except for a brief visit to Camden on May 17 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.); see also <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed. William Sloane
      Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Company, 1904), 58–59.<a href="#r3">[back]
