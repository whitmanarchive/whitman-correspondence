      <br xmlns="" class="opener">7th July, 1885.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> More than a month back I addressed a letter to you, which misfortune of one kind
      or
      another may have overtaken, or which you may not yet have had time or inclination
      to
      answer.<sup><a href="#n6101" id="r1">1</a></sup> It was referring to the scheme of a new
      edition of your Poems in England here, but I'm afraid was not clear enough as to the
      rights &amp; reasons of such an edition, or the way it would be carried out. In the
      letter I explained something of  this, but not enough; and it was careless of me to do this &amp;
      then expect you to reply to an insufficient proposal, when you must have already
      more to do in this way than can be easily compassed. For fear too that the letter
      never reached you at all, it will be better to state the whole matter afresh. 
   </p>
   
   <p> A series of poets was last year begun by Walter Scott<sup><a href="#loc.03311_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> the
      publisher under the occasional editorship of my friend, Joseph Skipsey, poet &amp;
      former coal-miner;<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> (I have been a coal-miner—a
      mining engineer that is—myself; hence the connection!) and in their list a
      month or two after my arrival in London as a student of life &amp; letters this
      year, I saw rather to my astonishment your name  amid the rest, &amp; feeling that
      in some ways I had a special right &amp; knowledge I ventured to write in, offering to
      prepare the 
      vol.
      
       Skipsey's influence did the rest. 
   </p>
   
   <p> At first it seemed rather out of place to have your work in a series of this kind
      called, rather stupidly, "The Canterbury Poets," and got up in a cheap &amp;
      prettified fashion, with red lines, &amp;c. But afterwards it struck me that there
      might be gain in the end through it. Now I have succeeded in one hope: the
      publishers will give up the red lines &amp; trivial design of cover. Next will be to
      have your Poems issued in a different shape—quite square I should like to have
      it—so as to give your long lines full play! And the very  including of <u>Leaves of Grass</u> in a series like this gives them a chance of reaching people who
      would otherwise never see them. What I—&amp; many
      young men like me, ardent believers in your poetic initiative—chiefly feel
      about this is however, that an edition at a price which will put it in the reach of
      the poorest member of the great social democracy is a thing of imperative
      requirement. You know what a fervid stir &amp; impulse forward of Humanity there is
      to-day in certain quarters, and I am sure you will be tremendously glad to help us
      here, in the very camp of the enemy, the stronghold of caste &amp; aristocracy &amp;
      all selfishness between rich &amp; poor! 
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p> Some people want to claim you as the property of a certain literary clique,—a
      <u>rara avis</u>, to be carefully kept out of sight of the
      uneducated mob as not able to understand &amp; appreciate the peculiar qualities of
      your work. This does harm in many ways, &amp; it would be a very good thing to make
      a fair trial of the despised mob. The price of Wilson &amp; McCormick's edition<sup><a href="#loc.03311_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> —half-a-guinea—practically damns the popular
      circulation of the book, &amp; gives colour to the notion of its being a luxury only
      for the rich. What we want then is an edition for the poor, &amp; this proposed one
      at only a shilling would be within reach of every man willing &amp; caring to read. 
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p> I did not know until a week or so back that Wilson &amp; McCormick had any direct
      authorisation for their Edn, or should certainly have
      advised Walter Scott to communicate his intention to them. Now someone has written
      on their behalf resenting—very naturally—his appearance in the field.
      But this difficulty might be easily settled by Scott paying, say ten guineas outright
      or a certain royalty per copy, to them on your account, if W. &amp; McC. would not
      like a new contract with you by Scott. The fact of the new proposed edn being one of smaller scope [the 
      vol.
      
       would not hold more than ⅔rds of the
      poetry;] would no doubt weigh with them too, reference being clearly made to the
      complete works to which this would serve as a pilot for  the time being, &amp; increase the
      sale in the end. 
   </p>
   
   <p> As for my own share, all I really care about is to procure a serviceable popular
      edition, giving all the help an earnest &amp; enthusiastic sympathy can devise. On
      mere literary grounds I have very little claim, but I have a great love &amp; desire
      to help the struggling mass of men, to be a true soldier in "The War of liberation
      of Humanity." I should strive to just say what would best bring your Ideal to the
      hearts of such as the coal-miners &amp; shepherds of the North—dear friends of
      mine many of them, many consciously, all unconsciously—and being a young
      man myself to make Leaves of Grass potent for comradeship and chivalry &amp;
      manliness all through in the young men who are in the forefront to-day.  I feel very much
      inclined to say a great deal more about my hopes and ideals, but to-night perhaps
      it
      is better not. One thing though I must say a word about,—how much in noblest
      knowledge &amp; inspiration I have to thank you for, in life &amp; religion &amp;
      poetry &amp; manhood, a debt it will not suffice to pay in words at all, but which
      someday you will see, I hope, may be fairly written off the score. Meanwhile,
      receive the greeting of one more follower on this side the Atlantic,— 
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      very earnestly—
      <br></br>Ernest Rhys.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p> Any suggestions or directions as to the scheme &amp; scope of the book I will
      thank you for most heartily, and will furnish fuller details as they are
      arranged.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <p id="loc.03311_n2">2. <em>Leaves of
         Grass: The Poems of Walt Whitman [Selected]</em>, with an introduction by
      Rhys, was printed in 1886 in The Canterbury Poet Series, published by Walter
      Scott. Though aimed at the British working class, and despite Rhys's hopes, the
      volume did retain its ornate decorations and red borders. A presentation copy in
      the Feinberg Collection reads: "Walt Whitman with Ernest Rhys's apologies &amp;
      high regards. 1st March 1886." On  Rhys
      informed the poet that about 8,000 copies of the edition were sold, and that the
      publisher expected to print a second edition. In the same letter Rhys requested
      permission to include <em>Specimen Days</em> in a prose series
      called The Camelot Classics.<a href="#r2">[back]
