      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr Dowden,
      
   </p>   
   
   
   <p>I must no longer delay writing, &amp; to acknowledge your letters of Sept 5 and Oct
      15 last.<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I had previously (Aug 22)<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> written you very briefly in response to your friendly
      letter of July 23d, the first you wrote me, accompanying copy of the Review.<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> All—letters &amp; Review—have been read
      &amp; reread. I am sure I appreciate you in them. May I say you do not seem to stand
      afar off, but very near to me. What John Burroughs<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      brings adds confirmation. I was deeply interested in the acc'ts given in the letters
      of your friends. I do not hesitate to call them mine too.<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Tyrell, Cross, your brother,<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      Miss West,<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> Todhunter,<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      O'Grady<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup>—Yeats,<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup>
      Ellis,<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n12" id="r12">12</a></sup> Nettleship.<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n13" id="r13">13</a></sup>
      Affectionate remembrance to all of them. You especially, and Mrs. Dowden, &amp;
      indeed all of you, already, I say, stand near to me. I wish each to be told my
      remembrance (or to see this letter if convenient).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I like well the positions &amp; ideas in your Westminster article—and radiating
      from the central point of assumption of my pieces being, or commencing "the poetry
      of Democracy." It presents all the considerations which such a critical text &amp;
      starting point require, in a full, eloquent, &amp; convincing manner. I entirely
      accept it, all &amp; several, &amp; am not unaware that it probably afforded, if not
      the only, at least the most likely gate, by which you as an earnest friend of my
      book, &amp; believing critic of it, would gain entrance to a leading
      review—Besides, I think the main theme you exploit is really of the first
      importance—and all the rest can be broached &amp; led to, through it, as well
      as any other way.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I would say that (as you of course see) the spine or verteber principle of my book
      is
      a model or ideal (for the service of the New World, &amp; to be gradually absorbed
      in it) of a complete healthy, heroic, practical modern <em>Man</em>—emotional, moral, spiritual, patriotic—a grander better son,
      brother, husband, father, friend, citizen than any yet—formed &amp; shaped in
      consonance with modern science, with American Democracy, &amp; with the requirements
      of current industrial &amp; professional life—model of a Woman also, equally
      modern &amp; heroic—a better daughter, wife, mother, citizen also, than any
      yet. I seek to typify a living Human Personality, immensely animal, with immense
      passions, immense amativeness, immense adhesiveness—in the woman immense
      maternity—&amp; then, in both, immenser far a <em>moral
         conscience</em>, &amp; in always realizing the direct &amp; indirect control of
      the divine laws through all and over all forever.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In "Democratic Vistas" I seek to make patent the appalling vacuum, in our times &amp;
      here, of any school of great imaginative Literature &amp; Art, fit for a Republican,
      Religious, &amp; Healthy people—and to suggest &amp; prophesy such a
      Literature as the only vital means of sustaining &amp; perpetuating such a people. I
      would project at least the rough sketch of such a school of Literatures—an
      entirely new breed of authors, poets, American, comprehensive, Hegelian, Democratic,
      religious—&amp; with an infinitely larger scope &amp; method than any yet<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n14" id="r14">14</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>There is one point touched by you in the Westminster criticism that if occasion again
      arises, might be dwelt on more fully—that is the attitude of sneering denial
      which magazines, editors, publishers, "critics" &amp;c. in the U. S. hold toward
      "Leaves of Grass." As to "Democratic Vistas" it remains entirely unread, uncalled
      for here in America. If you write again for publication about my books, or have
      opportunity to influence any forthcoming article on them, I think it would be a
      proper &amp; even essential part of such article to include the fact that the books
      are hardly recognized at all by the orthodox literary &amp; conventi[on]al
      authorities of the U. S.—that the opposition is bitter, &amp; in a large
      majority, &amp; that the author was actually turned out of a small government
      employment &amp; deprived of his means of support by a Head of Department at
      Washington solely on account of having written his poems.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>True I take the whole matter coolly. I know my book has been composed in a cheerful
      &amp; contented spirit—&amp; that the same still substantially remains with
      me. (And I want my friends, indeed, when writing for publication about my poetry,
      to
      present its gay-heartedness as one of its chief qualities.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am in excellent health, &amp; again &amp; still work as clerk here in Washington.</p>
   
   
   <p>I saw John Burroughs very lately. He is well. He showed me a letter he had just rec'd
      from you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish more &amp; more (and especially now that I realize I know you, &amp; we should
      be no strangers) to journey over sea, &amp; visit England &amp; your country.<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n15" id="r15">15</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Tennyson has written to me twice—&amp; very cordial &amp;
      hearty letters. He invites me to become his guest.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have rec'd a letter from Joaquin Miller.<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n16" id="r16">16</a></sup>
      He was at last accounts in Oregon, recuperating, studying,
      enjoying grand &amp; fresh Nature, &amp; writing something new.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Emerson has just been this way (Baltimore &amp; Washington) lecturing. He maintains
      the same attitude—draws on the same themes—as twenty-five years
      ago. It all seems to me quite attenuated (the <em>first</em> drawing
      of a good pot of tea, you know, and Emerson's was the heavenly herb itself—but
      what must one say to a <em>second</em>, and even <em>third</em> or <em>fourth</em> infusion?) I send you a newspaper
      report of his lecture here a night or two ago. It is a fair sample.<sup><a href="#loc.01491_n17" id="r17">17</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And now, my dear friend, I must close. I have long wished to write you a letter to
      show, if nothing more, that I heartily realize your kindness &amp; sympathy, &amp;
      would draw the communion closer between us. I shall probably send you any thing I
      publish, and any thing about my affairs or self that might interest you. You too
      must write freely to me—&amp; I hope frequently—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>).
