   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4146">2. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel (1856–1914), was
      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on his relationship with Whitman, see
      Thomas Biggs Harned, <em>Memoirs of Thomas B. Harned, Walt
         Whitman's Friend and Literary Executor</em>, ed. Peter Van Egmond (Hartford:
      Transcendental Books, 1972).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4133">3. In late 1887, James Gordon Bennett,
      Jr., editor of the <em>New York Herald</em>, invited Whitman to
      contribute a series of poems and prose pieces for the paper. From December 1887
      through August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems appeared.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00450_n2">4. Ezra H. Heywood
      (1829–1893), a radical reformer and an advocate of free love, was arrested
      on October 26, 1881, because he printed "To a Common Prostitute" and "A Woman
      Waits for Me" in <em>The Word</em> and attempted to mail the
      journals. On , O'Connor noted a
      newspaper report of Heywood's arrest: "I don't like Heywood's ways, and I don't
      like the Free-Love theories at all, but he has his rights, which these devils
      trample on" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.50.html">Monday, March 11, 1889</a>). See also the letter from Whitman to O'Connor
      of .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07636_n2">5. On March 23, 1888,
      Whitman lent Heywood $15 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07636_n3">6. On his way back from
      Florida Bucke stayed briefly in Philadelphia and discussed publication of
      Whitman's poetry with J. B. Lippincott Company. On March 6 the publisher wrote
      to Bucke: "We have carefully considered the question of making a proposition for
      the publication of Walt Whitman's Poems, but have concluded that we could not
      use his works to advantage" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3166">7. Thomas Eakins (1844–1919) was
      an American painter. His relationship with Whitman was characterized by deep
      mutual respect, and he soon became a close friend of the poet. For more on
      Eakins, see Philip W. Leon, "Eakins, Thomas (1844–1916)," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07636_n4">8. Apparently Eakins brought
      his painting of Whitman back to Camden on March 23, 1888 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, and see also Whitman's letter to Bucke ). William Sloane Kennedy noted that it was hanging in
      Whitman's "shanty" in May, and commented: "It is a work of fine technical merit,
      has power in it beyond a doubt; but the expression and pose are not liked by
      many. To me it has something of the look of a jovial and somewhat dissipated old
      Dutch toper, such as Rubens or Teniers might have painted" (<em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [London: Alexander Gardner, 1896],
      30).<a href="#r8">[back]
