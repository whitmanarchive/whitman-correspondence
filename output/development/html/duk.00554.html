   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00554_n1">1. The date of this letter
      is uncertain, but clues point to a date of November 4, 1868. Richard Maurice
      Bucke assigned the date November 11, 1868, and Edwin Haviland Miller
      accepted Bucke's date (see Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:366). But the letter is likely to date to the Wednesday a
      week earlier, November 4, 1868. Another letter from Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman to Walt, which described Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's recent
      throat surgery, is more likely to date , and that letter fulfills this letter's concluding promise to
      "write about domestic affairs." Second, this letter does not mention
      Mattie's throat surgery or her recovery from that surgery. Presumably, then,
      the throat surgery was still in the future at the time of this letter.
      Louisa wrote bluntly in this letter that "i have not got any hous yet." In
      her next week's letter (November 11), she wrote that son George Washington
      Whitman "has got a draw of the two houses they talk of building," which
      implies that Louisa believed that one of the two houses that George planned
      to build will be for her and her son Edward Whitman.<br><br>
      This letter has no mention of Charley Mann or his illness, a topic that
      dominates Louisa's  letter.
      Finally, this letter says that George went to Camden "last night" and is
      expected to stay there until "2 weeks from next Saturday" (November 21 if
      this letter dates to November 4). In the November 10 letter, she wrote that
      George "is away," but he has returned to Brooklyn by Louisa's  letter. That George remained
      away in Camden for two full weeks is unlikely because Louisa wrote in this
      letter that he "is very much carried away by somebody," presumably Louisa
      Orr Haslam, his future wife. Because a number of contextual clues point to
      this letter's date as a Tuesday approximately a week before Louisa's
      November 11, 1868 letter to Walt—and though no one clue is
      decisive—this letter dates November to 4, 1868.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00554_n2">3. The pipe foundry located in
      Camden, New Jersey, was the R. D. Wood Foundry, where George Washington
      Whitman's brother Thomas Jefferson Whitman had pipe made for the St. Louis Water
      Works. George accepted a position as inspector of pipes at the foundry in late
      1869.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00554_n3">4. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. He later
      designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city
      engineer. For more information on Walt Whitman's dealings with Lane, see
      Whitman's  letter to Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00554_n4">5. The woman that Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman identified as George Washington Whitman's "somebody" is almost
      certainly Louisa Orr Haslam, whom he would marry in spring 1871. See Gay Wilson
      Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1955),
      443. Louisa's term "somebody" is her euphemism for a companion with whom one has
      a romantic interest. She likewise described a companion of Joseph Phineas Davis,
      who is "here quite often to supper and stay all night," as a "mr somebody" (see
      her  letter to Walt).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00554_n7">6. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," had arrived in Brooklyn from St. Louis
      for medical treatment and a holiday visit in mid-October. Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman joined his wife and children near the end of November, and
      they returned to St. Louis in mid-December. It is possible that Mattie
      departed from Brooklyn for a brief period in mid- or late-November 1868 (see
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's 
      letter to Walt Whitman).<br><br>
      Mattie and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In early
      1868, Mattie and her daughters moved from Brooklyn to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent
      of Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her
      death in 1873. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed.,
      "Introduction," <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      1–26.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00554_n8">7. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman's early November 1868 letter to Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman is not
      extant, but he remained in St. Louis. Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890)
      was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt
      Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he worked as a surveyor and
      topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working for the Brooklyn Water
      Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a nationally recognized
      name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00554_n9">8. William Ezra Worthen
      (1819–1897) was the sanitary engineer of the Metropolitan Board of Health
      of New York City from 1866 to 1869.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00554_n10">9. The absence of punctuation
      for dialog is somewhat disorienting in this section of the letter. After Mattie
      said, according to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, that she wished "they would hurry
      up and pay the other hundred," Louisa informed Mattie that she had predicted to
      George Washington Whitman that Mattie would say that as soon as she received the
      $200 check.<a href="#r9">[back]
