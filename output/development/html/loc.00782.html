   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Nathaniel Bloom operated
      a fancy-goods store on Broadway for many years. What appears to be an early
      description of him was printed by Richard Maurice Bucke, ed., in <em>Notes and Fragments</em> from <em>The Complete
         Writings of Walt Whitman</em> (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902), 9:142;
      Trent Collection, Duke University): "Bloom—Broad-shouldered, six-footer, with a
      hare-lip. Clever fellow, and by no means bad looking… Direct, plain-spoken,
      natural-hearted, gentle-tempered, but awful when roused—cartman, with a horse,
      cart &amp;c, of his own—drives for a store in Maiden lane." Whitman referred to
      him in one of his notebooks (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The
      Library of Congress, Notebook #109). Later in life Bloom was listed as an
      importer; his name does not appear in the Directories after 1900.
