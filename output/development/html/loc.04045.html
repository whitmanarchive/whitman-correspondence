      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I 
      rec'd
      
       your good letter some days since, &amp; would like indeed to be down with you
      &amp; George &amp; all—but the bitter cold continues so I think I'd better
      stay close here for the present—but it won't be long before I shall be with
      you all—I suppose you &amp; the rest are reading Herbert's books from time to
      time—though they are very queer in the story of Blake's life and works, there
      is a deal that is interesting &amp; good to chew on—then they are such
      beautiful specimens of paper &amp; printing, it is a pleasure to read them<sup><a href="#loc.04045_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I had a nice visit from Harry and Mont—there is nothing new or interesting to
      write you—it is now ½ past 2, after dinner, &amp; I have been writing
      &amp; fixing up a composition alone in my room, since breakfast—it is a
      cloudy, cold raw day here, rather lonesome, but still I make out—(but I could
      make out better if I have the rest of the day on a visit to Glendale, &amp; a good
      strong cup of tea with you &amp; Ruth, to cheer me up)—I am still feeling
      pretty well so far this winter, bless the Lord—I send Debbie a book "<u>the Old Curiosity Shop</u>"—love to her and Joe—have
      you had any more <u>hog-killings</u>—which is the most fun?
      them or the Glendale church?

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04045_n1">1. On January 30 Whitman
      sent this letter to Susan Stafford as well as a "'wrestling' slip to Harry" and
      <em>Old Curiosity Shop</em> to Deborah Browning (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04045_n2">2. Presumably the new and
      enlarged two-volume edition, <em>Life of William Blake, with
         Selections</em> (1880), containing the memoir of Herbert's father, Alexander
      Gilchrist.<a href="#r2">[back]
