   <p>Yours of 21 &amp; the Transcripts &amp; the Scotch papers rec'd—thanks for all—I have
      written you quite copiously lately—I continue well for me—all the little <em>Herald</em>
      pieces<sup><a href="#n4133" id="r1">1</a></sup> will appear (with misprints corrected) in <em>November Boughs<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r2">2</a></sup></em>—two things the
      reason why of this card. <em>Dont let your Wilson book<sup><a href="#duk.00925_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> go to press till you have read
         the proofs</em>. 2d—please enclose to me the Alabama letter, to be return'd to
      you<sup><a href="#duk.00924_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup>—dont mind its malignance—the blizzard &amp; its immediate results all over
      here—dark and rainy now—I am sitting here alone in the big chair—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4133">1. In late 1887, James Gordon Bennett,
      Jr., editor of the <em>New York Herald</em>, invited Whitman to
      contribute a series of poems and prose pieces for the paper. From December 1887
      through August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems appeared.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">2. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00925_n4">3. Whitman is referring to
      Kennedy's manuscript "Walt Whitman, Poet of Humanity." Kennedy had reported in a
      letter to Whitman of  that
      Frederick W. Wilson was willing to publish the study. Kennedy's manuscript
      eventually became two books, <em>Reminiscences of Walt
         Whitman</em> (1896) and <em>The Fight of a Book for the
         World</em> (1926).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00924_n1">4. Whitman is probably
      referring to a letter from John Newton Johnson. For the letter, see William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896],
      19–21. On , Kennedy confessed
      "a good deal of sympathy for our cranky friend Johnson."<a href="#r4">[back]
