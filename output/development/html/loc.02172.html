   <p> I received

      <u>post-card</u> this week, and 
      frwrd
      
       it to Leonard M. Brown,<sup><a href="#loc.02172_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> as I thought it would
      please him. He is a very nice man,—young, a school master;—something
      very striking about him:—Brown [
      <span class="unclear">intends?</span>]
       going to America next summer, when no doubt he will call upon you. 
   </p>
   
   <p> You have not acknowledged Richard Colles'<sup><a href="#loc.01302_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> ￡2.
      sent by me per money order before Browns ￡5. and I have also remitted to you 14s.6d from Cambridge 
       friends, since I sent Brown's, kindly let me know about these two sums
      <u>soon as you can.</u> Glad to have pretty good accounts of
      you. 
   </p>
   
   <p> You make no allusion to my Book or my little confidences thereon: do you care for
      a
      copy?
