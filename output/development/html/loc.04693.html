      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Sitting here tonight after my day's work is done, thinking of some of my friends &amp;
      of <u>you</u>—an impulse comes upon me to write to you again
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Today is Fred Wild's<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r2">2</a></sup> birthday, &amp; tonight a number of his friends are met at his house to spend the evening
      in social mirth &amp; rejoicing. For different reasons (health the main [
      <span class="unclear">one?</span>]
      ) I am not with
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>them—and will write to you instead.</p>
   
   
   <p>Fred has been away from home this week on business. So Johnston<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; I sent to his house for the copy of L. of G. you sent him (&amp; which came after he
      had left) so that we might <u>give</u> it to him as a joint present
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wrote the following inscription in it:—</p>
   
   
   <p>To <u>Fred Wild</u></p>
   
   <p>Something for a token from</p>
   
   <p>J. Johnston</p>
   
   <p><u>J.W. Wallace</u></p>
   
   <p><u>9th January 1891</u></p>
   
   
   <p>With the love of comrades.</p>
   
   <p><u>With the life long love of comrades!</u></p>
   
   <p>See Bottom of Page 119.</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Fred is an old school chum of mine &amp; we have been intimate &amp; affectionate friends
      ever since. My mother used to say he was her other son. We are very widely different
      in many ways, but our friendship has lasted through all these years without [illegible] break, [illegible] I trust it will continue through old age" too.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>He has the English edition of L. of G. but wanted the pocket book edition &amp; asked
      Johnston to procure it. In its presentation to him by Johnston &amp; myself [illegible] &amp; in the fact
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>that we are all three lovers of you—I feel that we not only express an old affection,
      but that we enter into fresh obligations to carry on your &amp; in particular to establish
      wherever possible the institution of the dear love of comrades.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I sit here in this quiet country place, away from the clank of the world <u>my</u> soul, too, rejoices in comrades, &amp; in writing to you I invoke a larger measure of
      your own spirit.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I thank you, dear friend &amp; master, for the strong illumination.</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Outside building operations have been stopped for 5 weeks or so. Alas! for the poor
      fellows who with their families, <u>at best</u> live only from hand to mouth &amp; who are now starving.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With love to you
      <br></br>Yours affectionately
      <br></br>J.W. Wallace
   </p>
   
   
   <p>P.S. (by J Johnston) Jan 10th 1891<sup><a href="#loc.04693_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>This morning I called at JWW's office to show him a very kind letter I had just received
      from your friend WM Rossetti<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r5">5</a></sup> when he showed me this letter &amp; suggested that I should add a few lines to it
   </p>
   
   <p>I spent a very pleasant</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>time at Fred Wild's last night the only drawback being the absence of Fred himself,
      he being detained at Coventry on business.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This afternoon I spent a couple of hours with JWW at Anderton &amp; we had a truly delightful
      walk thru beautiful Rivington now all mantled in snow. It was a lovely afternoon &amp;
      as we tramped along the hardened snow tracks of the field path roadways we talked
      a good deal about you &amp; at intervals JWW read aloud passages from "L of G," our hearts
      filled with loving grateful thoughts of
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>which your personal loving kindnesses to Johnston &amp; myself have cast upon your words.
      Powerfully as your words had moved us before, they do so still more as we see you—in
      your old age &amp; weakness—so full of consideration &amp; tenderness, so regardless of your
      own personl comfort &amp; leisure, &amp; so unwearied in your constant acts of loving-kindness
      to us both. Love &amp; gratitude to you evermore! And to us more &amp; more of your spirit!
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I hope that your health has continued to improve since the date of your last communications
      &amp; of Traubel's<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r6">6</a></sup> letter.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I sent a brief harried note to Traubel by the last mail, &amp; thought of supplementing
      it by a letter this mail. But I cannot now do so. Will you convey to him my affectionate
      regards &amp; best wishes?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Last week, we had 3 or 4 days of thaw. But the frost set in again as keen as ever
      &amp; last night we had a heavy snowfall.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on

   <p id="n0522">5. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4267">6. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
