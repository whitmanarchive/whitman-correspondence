      A. SIMPSON &amp; CO.,
      <br></br>PUBLISHERS &amp; PRINTERS,
      <br></br>60 Duane St., New York.
      
      <br></br><br></br>DEAR SIR:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your attention is respectfully called to the annexed specimen page of a volume to
      be entitled:
   </p>
   
   <p><em>SLAVE SONGS OF THE UNITED STATES.</em></p>
   
   <p>The collection will, probably, exceed one hundred in number, of which the music accompanies
      the words, besides some words without music, and some music without words. It is based
      primarily on the collections of Prof. Wm. F. Allen, Charles P. Ware and Miss Lucy
      McKim, but consists also of contributions from the best sources in all parts of the
      South. Among the States represented are South Carolina (very extensively), Georgia,
      Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Arkansas, Missouri, and
      the Mississippi River. A preface by Prof. Allen, will give the most interesting facts
      connected with the songs, together with some account of the Sea Island dialect. The
      whole will be comprised in an octavo volume of about 150 pages, printed in the most
      handsome manner and substantially bound.
   </p>
   
   <p>A book of this description, unique, valuable for preserving, what, under the new <em>regime</em> at the South, it is daily becoming more difficult to secure, and attractive to all
      lovers of music by reason of the beautiful melodies which it embalms, would seem to be entitled to a wide circulation, and as such is hereby recommended
      to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>The publishers, being desirous of ascertaining in advance how large an edition it
      will be necessary to print, take this mode of soliciting an order from you.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br xmlns="">Aug. 1st, 1867.
      Respectfully,
      <br></br>A. SIMPSON &amp; CO.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>To the foregoing may be added the following sketch of the proposed arrangement of
      the songs:
   </p>
   <br><br>
   I.—"SPIRITUALS."
   1.—THE SOUTH-EASTERN STATES.
   <span>The Coffin's Point Collection,</span><br>
   <span>The Cap'n John Fripp Collection,</span><br>
   <span>Col. Higginson's Regiment,</span><br>
   <span>Mrs. A. M. Bowen's Collection, (the earliest of all,)</span><br>
   <span>The Florida and Miscellaneous Collections.</span><br>
   
   
   <p>The above embraces the Sea Islands, and the Main from Charleston to the Gulf, nearly
      a hundred songs in all.
   </p>
   <br><br>
   2.—THE NORTH-EASTERN STATES.
   <span>North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware.</span><br>
   
   <br><br>
   3.—THE WESTERN STATES.
   <span>Nashville, and the Mississippi River.</span><br>
   
   <br><br>
   II.—SECULAR SONGS.
   <span></span><br>
   
   <br><br>
   III.—WORDS WITHOUT MUSIC.
   <span></span><br>
   
   
   <p>As will be observed, under the first division, the editors are fortunate in being
      able to include most of the "Spirituals" printed by Col.. T. W. HIGGINSON in the June
      <em>Atlantic</em>. They were most kindly made over to the present collection by the compiler, and by
      the publishers Messrs. TICKNOR and FIELDS.
   </p>
   
   <p>The truly musical, the lovers of the curious, the students of language, the friends
      of the colored race in America, of course will have an interest in a work of this
      character; but it has also very high claims as a contribution to history, and as a
      record of religious feeling which would be remarkable in any age.
