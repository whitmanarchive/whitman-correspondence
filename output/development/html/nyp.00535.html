      <br></br><br></br>Dear Son &amp; Comrade
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have got word from you once or twice<sup><a href="#nyp.00535_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—&amp; glad
      to hear that you keep well &amp; in good spirits—that's more than half the
      battle—&amp; I'm sure its the <em>best half</em> too—I got
      a letter from Dr B[ucke] to-day—he mentions you in it, &amp; speaks very
      friendlily indeed of you—I also rec'd a letter from your mother to-day, which
      I will enclose, as every thing from home is welcome, (even if she has written
      already to you, as is very likely)—I have written to your mother this
      evening—
   </p>
   
   <p>I jog along very much in the old way—am pretty well, so far this
      winter—(they say I am fatter &amp; more red-faced than ever)—I spent my
      Christmas over in Germantown at Mr and Mrs Williams's,<sup><a href="#nyp.00535_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      new friends, very nice, &amp; a big family of children—was there four
      days—had a jolly time—a sleigh ride, or two—fine traveling, but
      too cold to enjoy it—Ruth and Burt<sup><a href="#nyp.00535_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> were up here to
      see me last week—Ruth is going to make a fine looking woman, &amp; good-sized,
      like her mother (<em>Shape first, face afterward</em>, was the saying
      of a old sport I used to know)—I met Ed Stafford (John's son)<sup><a href="#nyp.00535_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> yesterday at the ferry—he asked about
      you—the boys are all curious to know about you—all wish you luck,
      sincerely—Well good bye for the present, my darling boy—Keep a good
      heart—we will be together yet &amp; have good times yet—(I shall break
      up from here in the Spring &amp; leave Camden—I don't know where)<sup><a href="#nyp.00535_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      to move to Burlington, N.J., Whitman had to make new living arrangements.
      According to O'Connor's letter to Whitman on , the poet evidently discussed with Burroughs the possibility of
      going to Esopus.<a href="#r5">[back]
