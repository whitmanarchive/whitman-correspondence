      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still here—Your kind letter &amp; the papers arrived at noon to-day—Thanks—They are the first visitations of the sort from <em>the outside world</em> for a week—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Sunday Mr S[tafford] and I took a long ride (did I tell you before)—Tuesday another,
      this time to a <em>farm-auction</em>, where all the neighbors were gathered, 100 or more—quite a scene, and a real study
      of character, looks &amp; manners here—I scanned it all well, (&amp; was doubtless scanned
      in return)<sup><a href="#upa.00160_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Mr S was to go up last night with a load of straw for market, but it rained furiously,
      &amp; he did not go—Rain all day till middle of this afternoon, since which we have had
      a glorious four hours, grand rainbow &amp; gorgeous sunset—but now, as I write, (8½) it
      looks like rain again—I still keep well—appetite any how quite magnificent—At least
      two hours forenoon, &amp; two afternoon, down by the <em>creek</em>—Passed between <em>sauntering</em>—the <em>hickory saplings</em>—&amp; "<em>Honor</em> is the <em>subject</em> of my story"—(for explanation of the last three lines, ask Herby—)<sup><a href="#upa.00160_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I am glad Bee gets on so well (but I expected it) &amp; my prayers <em>might</em> go up, (if it were not for Tyndal)<sup><a href="#upa.00160_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> not only toward the success of the <em>second</em> negative,<sup><a href="#upa.00160_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> but for you &amp; Giddy in <em>that</em> ("up to your ears" of) <em>needle-work</em>—I shall be up before many days<sup><a href="#upa.00160_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—May be soon—at any rate I think I shall take supper with you by next Tuesday—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00160_n1">1. During the auction,
      Whitman, "pinched by the cold," took "refuge in the house, by a window, whence I
      get a full view of the crowd." He observed the people, "old &amp; young, a
      hundred or more, mostly men &amp; young fellows, but a few housewives &amp;
      young women . . . Very well they look too, in my opinion—not only handsome
      &amp; open-eyed, and fresh &amp; independent, with wit enough, movements a
      little sluggish, but none the less artistic for that—always evidencing
      power—but with a certain heroic, rugged element through all" (Clifton
      Waller Barrett Collection, University of Virginia).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00160_n2">2. A cryptic reference to
      Harry Stafford ("<em>hickory saplings . . . Honor . . .
         subject</em>"). Perhaps the c in "<em>creek</em>" referred to
      Edward Cattell, another one of his young Kirkwood friends, to whom the poet had
      written on February 10 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). See the letter from Whitman to Edward Cattell of . Herbert Gilchrist noted that
      Whitman was fond of quoting Cassius's speech to Brutus, "Well, honour is the
      subject of my story" (<em>Julius Caesar</em>, 1.2.91; Herbert
      Harlakenden Gilchrist, <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and
         Writings</em> [London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887], 241). Whitman placed a large
      bracket about this passage in the margin.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00160_n3">3. A reference to the
      investigations of John Tyndall (1820–1893), the British physicist.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00160_n4">4. Probably an allusion to
      an experiment conducted by Beatrice Gilchrist at the medical school.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00160_n5">5. Whitman returned on the
      following day (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r5">[back]
