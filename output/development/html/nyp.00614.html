   <p>Thanks for your good letter rec'd this forenoon—I sympathize with William<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> as my brother in affliction, besides in soul—so wish I
      could show it practically—Very little by little &amp; slowly, I seem to be
      improving—Ab't the worst is the forced confinement (now seven months) to
      in-doors &amp; the sick room

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
