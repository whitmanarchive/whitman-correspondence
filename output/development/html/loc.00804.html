   <p>I sent you a letter four days ago that Andrew was gone at last, poor fellow. I have
      written to Han. I did not go on to Andrew's funeral, (I suppose it was yesterday)—but
      I am very very sorry now that I did not stay while I was home—I am well—Write when
      you can—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00804_n1">1. This note to George was
      written on the verso of Jeff's letter of : "I have just telegraphed to you that Andrew was dead. Poor boy,
      he died much easier than one would have supposed. I do hope to God you will come
      on. I have been with him, Mary, Mother, Mat and I, almost all the time since you
      left. Mary and I watched last night. He has been dying ever since Wednesday
      morning—fully 24 hours—Poor Nancy, she takes it woful hard. Mary has acted like
      the best of Women. It is very affecting to see Nancy and the children. Mattie
      did everything that she possibly could. She watched with us till near 3 o'clock
      this morning. Andrew was very desirous of having us all around him when he died.
      The poor boy seemed to think that that would take nearly all the horror of it
      away."<a href="#r1">[back]
