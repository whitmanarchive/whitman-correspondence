      <br></br>Washington, D.C.
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">May 20, 1882
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have yours of the 17th, and also your picture, for which many thanks. It is a fine
      presentment.
   </p>
   
   <p>My article has gone to the <u>Tribune</u> with a note to Whitelaw Reid, and we await the
      result. I hope, if it appears, you will like it. Of course, you are not in any way
      responsible for it, and  this is the position for you to take. Learning the facts, I use
      the independent privilege of a friend, and of a citizen, to criticise the offenders.
      <u>I alone am responsible.</u></p>
   
   <p>I composed the article under great affliction, for as the devil would have it, there
      were several days of shocking raw weather, followed by five consecutive days of
      rain, and I got the influenza,  and was half dead with headache, a racking cough and all the
      accompaniments. Nothing therefore was right for composition but the heart. Despite
      conditions, Charley Eldridge, who got here from California in time to read what I
      have written, and of whose cool-headedness and judgmatical quality I think highly,
      considers it the best thing I have done,  which I hope will prove true. At
      all events, if it gets printed, it will be the opening gun in a tremendous
      cannonade, and we will have war on the enemy in England at any rate, which is what
      will hurt Oliver Stevens and company here.
   </p>
   
   <p> My object is to smoke the hidden movers in this business out of their holes, and
      I
      kept this in mind through the whole composition.  
      Hence, although I knew that
      Marston was behind the Boston attorney, I took care not to even mention his name,
      but focussed all my fire right upon Oliver Stevens, who, you know, is the only one
      that appears officially in the transaction. He will never endure to be exclusively
      blistered  in
      this way, but will in defence inculpate the State Attorney General. The minute he
      brings him forward, I will give them both the devil. In the present article, I have
      been very guarded, and have interwoven fury with moderation, but when we get Marston
      to the front, there will be augmented  fire for his hide, and I hope to
      make it so intolerable for him, that he will in self-defence peach on the holy
      citizens who have egged him on. Then, when we get their names, will be the time for
      punishment, memorable and terrible. They shall never be forgotten. The whole gang
      shall hang in chains for  all time.
   </p>
   
   <p>This must be our object—to discover the history of this persecution—the
      names of the subterranean movers. You must help me in this all you can. Perhaps
      Lathrop can discover.
   </p>
   
   <p>You are quite right in feeling as you do toward Osgood &amp; Co., besides being
      magnanimous, but 
      it is not for me, nor for anyone else to approve their course, which has simply
      been on the lowest plane of huckster prudence. You had grounds against them for an
      action for damages. They solicited your book, they knew its character, they agreed
      to non-expurgation, and at the first breath of  trouble, they flunked. It is all
      right for you to take such an attitude as you do toward them—for <u>you</u>
      personally; but my part, and the part of all your friends, is to whale them. You,
      of
      course, are not responsible.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have a strong suspicion that when the truth comes to be known,  the Rev. Thomas
      Wentworth Higginson will be found behind the State Attorney General as an
      instigator. His tone toward you, in the <u>Woman's Journal</u>
      article (and the <u>Nation</u> was probably his,) shows extreme
      venom. I know him, and know just where he is vulnerable, and will in due time plant
      a javelin where it will do him good.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have seen and 
      read twice your article in the N. A. Review. It is splendid, and cannot fail to do
      good. I only wish the style was a little clearer. I like better your earlier manner,
      so free from sub-clauses, involutions, parentheses—so direct and simple. In
      this country, in this age, when the necessity is upon us of addressing the whole
      people, and 
      not
      the college professors or bookmen merely, I set extreme value upon communication.
      To
      be readily apprehended by your auditory is, the truth being yours, the whole
      battle.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your position in the Review article is impregnable. Gibraltar is less strong. It only
      remains to show the relations of poetic statements to these  didactic truths. With many
      excellent people, especially when devoid of imagination, the trouble is to accept
      a
      passional expression, though they are quite willing to accept one simply
      descriptive, as in a physiological treatise. We live in a cursed abyss of society.
      Everything is sophisticated, everything polluted. To  a sane man or woman it is simply
      monstrous that the august and tender supra-mortal experience of a nuptial night,
      <u>cannot</u> be put into living poetry.
   </p>
   
   <p>—I hope my <u>Tribune</u> letter will appear and be satisfactory to you. It cost me great
      pains, as I had to move gingerly and with audacity at the same time. You will see
      how
      I have worked 
      Emerson's letter against Stevens like an engine.
   </p>
   
   <p>You must be careful in what you say of Emerson's position toward your amative
      passages. You have often told us that in his talk with you on the Common he had
      nothing to say on intrinsic grounds against these passages, but only on commercial
      or popular grounds. I remember your telling me that it was the saddest thing you
      ever heard that Emerson had 
      nothing to urge in all his vehement talk, but that the exclusion
      of these passages would make the book sell better. Nor could he have had. These
      passages are capable of the most unanswerable vindication on purely intellectual
      grounds merely, not to go deeper, and this Emerson knew. In his  letter to you he
      approves them. What else does his panegyric on your "<u>courage of
         treatment</u>" mean?—I mention this because I have thought from your way of
      mentioning the matter, that the enemy might say that you had allowed that Emerson
      was opposed to these passages on <u>moral</u> grounds, which
      would be untrue.
   </p>
