   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The <em>Cosmopolitan</em> magazine was first published in 1886 by publishers
      Schlicht &amp; Field of New York; it was billed as a "family magazine." Paul
      Schlicht acted as the magazine's initial editor. Whitman published one poem in
      the magazine, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00030.html">Shakespeare Bacon's Cipher</a>," in October 1887.
