      <br></br><br></br>Dear <u xmlns="">Sir</u>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>In one of your shorter poems in "Leaves of Grass" you say:—</p>
   
   "Stranger if you passing meet me and
   <br>desire to speak to me, why should you
   <br>not speak to me?"
    
   
   <p>And as I have met you (in spirit) and want to speak, I write you this letter.</p>
   
   <p>It is now some two years ago since your poems were first brought under my notice (by
      my friend Mr A. Ladell Balls) and their effect upon my life from that time has been
      most marked.
   </p>
   
   <p>You have taught, not only me, but the whole world, to realize that by living well
      and
      manfully in the present, we more than half form those circumstances which govern
      our future.
   </p>
   
   <p>You have taught us to regard all mankind as comrades and brothers;—<u>not</u> as mere insensate beings of whose credulities, weaknesses, and
      errors we are to take every advantage in effecting our own material progress through
      life.
   </p>
   
   <p>You have been the first to recognise, in all its fulness, the magnificent resources,
      and possibilities of America, and to teach us that the future of this country
      depends as much upon our exertions <u>now</u>, as upon the
      efforts of those who come after us.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your poems are stupendous outlines, which it is to be the glory of the younger
      generations to fill in.
   </p>
   
   <p>What I have
      written is not vain flattery, but the outcome of what I actually feel. The flattery
      accorded to you is no more than is accorded to any great and good man by those whose
      approbation he gains.
   </p>
   
   <p>I do not expect an answer to this letter as I am convinced that your time is
      sufficiently occupied already, to prevent your replying to such an humble denizen
      of
      the "New Democracy" as myself; but should you favor me with an answer I should be
      happier at receiving, than you at sending it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Long may you remain among us.</p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Very truly yours
      <br></br><u xmlns="">Henry H. Collins</u>
