      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   'Bram Stoker Feb, '76.
   
   
   <p>I hope you will not consider this letter from an utter stranger a liberty. Indeed,
      I hardly feel a stranger to you, nor is this the first letter that I have written
      to you. My friend Edward Dowden has told me often that you like new acquaintances or I should rather say friends.
      And as an old friend I send you an inclosure
      
      
      which may interest you. Four years ago I wrote the enclosed draft of a letter which
      I intended to copy out and send to you—it has lain in my desk since then—when I had
      heard that you were addressed as <u>Mr.</u> Whitman. It speaks for itself and needs no comment. It is as truly what I wanted
      to say as that light is light. The four years which have elapsed have made me love
      your work four fold and I can truly say that I have ever spoken as your friend.  You know what
      
      
      hostile criticism your work sometimes evokes here, and I wage a perpetual war with
      many friends on your behalf. But I am glad to say that I have been the means of making
      your work known to many who were scoffers at first. The years which have passed have
      not been uneventful to me, and I have felt and thought and suffered much in them,
      and I can truly say that from you I have had much pleasure and much consolation—and
      
      I do believe that your often earenst earnest speech has not been thrown away on me or that my life &amp; thoughts fail to
      be marked with its impress—I write this openly because I feel that with you one must
      be open. We have just had tonight a hot debate on your genius at the Fortnightly Club in which I had the privilege of putting forward my views—I think with success. Do
      not think me "cheeky" for writing this. I only hope we may sometime meet &amp; I shall
      be able perhaps to say what I cannot write. Dowden promised to get me a copy of your
      new edition, and I hope that for any other work which you may have you will let me
      always be an early subscriber. I am sorry you are not strong. Many of us are hoping
      
      
      
      
      
      to see you in Ireland.
   </p>
   
   <p>We had arranged to have a meeting for you. I do not know if you like getting letters.
      If you do I shall only be too happy to send you news of how thought goes among the
      men I know—With truest wishes for your health and happiness believe me
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Abraham ("Bram") Stoker (1847–1912) was the
      author of <em>Dracula</em>, secretary to Sir Henry Irving, and
      editor of <em>Personal Reminiscences of Henry Irving</em> (1906).
      As a young man, on February 18, 1872, Stoker wrote a personal, eccentric letter
      to Walt Whitman which he did not send until  (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1996],
      4:180–185). In the earlier letter he had written: "How sweet a thing it is
      for a strong healthy man with a woman's eyes and a child's wishes to feel that
      he can speak so to a man [Walt Whitman] who can be if he wishes, father, and
      brother and wife to his soul" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel,
      ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, 5:185). Stoker visited
      Whitman in 1884 (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em>
      (1955), 516).
