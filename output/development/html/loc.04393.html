      Dear Walt,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      A line or two—if only to pierce the distance between us, &amp; to convey my constant love
      &amp; good wishes. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Another day of midsummer warmth &amp; beauty—Never in my life do I remember to have known
      such weather so long 
      continued. Every day perfect &amp; like its predecessors. I seem to be living an enchanted
      life in a new earth. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      And I rejoice on <u>your</u> account. Surely you must be
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      gaining health from it, consciously or not.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I spent good part of this morning in writing letters home. My friends, of course,
      are interested in all my doings here, &amp; 
      I shall have to report pretty fully on my return. Perhaps my main hope, in connection
      with my trip, is that I may be able to
      make a better return for all their affection when I go back. I have reason to be devoutly
      thankful for my friends, &amp; it
      is a sacred privilege to me to convey their love to <u>you</u>—the "poet of comrades" &amp; our own 
      dearest friend. If only I may acquire more of your spirit!
      
   </p>

      This afternoon I read Symonds' poem "Love &amp; Death," &amp; copied most of it for further
      absorption at leisure. It seems so 
      characteristic of his cultured, sweet &amp; delicate spirit. God be with him &amp; bless him.
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Tomorrow I shall be away, so shall not be able to write to you. I go to Forest (near
      Sarnia) for the day to visit 
      Dr. J's<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r2">2</a></sup> aunt. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Dr.<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r3">3</a></sup> has some visitors tonight, so I write this (&amp; me to H.T.<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup>) in my 
      room—<u>your</u> room. Through the open window I see a few stars out—Jupitor lustrious &amp;
      dominating—chorus of frogs to sounding.—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      I sometimes wish my friends could see you personally &amp; come into direct contact with
      you. How their hearts would go out to you! 
      And I am sure you would love <u>them</u>—plain, unaffected, manly fellows that they are.—I am a poor
      representative of them in anything but love to you. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I think it a blessed Providence that led the Dr. to shew me the letters he has that
      you wrote to Pete Doyle. How our friends will 
      respond to the warm affection &amp; kindness they manifest! Deeper &amp; warmer love to you
      than ever in their name!  
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Good night &amp; God bless you. Love to Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; Warry<sup><a href="#loc.00668_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; to
      <u>you</u> above all.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4102">2. John Johnston (d. 1918) was a

   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="n6113">5. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,

   <p id="loc.00668_n4">6. Frederick Warren Fritzinger
      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,
      535).<a href="#r6">[back]
