   <p>Dark wet &amp; warm (almost) to-day—stay in to-day—yesterday out nearly
      two hours in my wheel chair—have read &amp; sent off the poemet proof to <em>Century</em>, is to be printed I believe in the May
      number—(Gilder<sup><a href="#n0871" id="r2">2</a></sup> ask'd for a sub-title to it)<sup><a href="#loc.07758_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—it is (did I tell you?) an emotional &amp;
      poetical mention of the immense unknown &amp; unnamed soldiers north &amp; south
      slain in the Secession War—Nothing new—Am ab't as well as
      usual—appetite, digestion, sleep, pulse &amp;c. not notably bad—wh'I
      suppose is quite a good deal to brag of for me—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Much sickness, failing, dying, death itself here—A play'd out sailor, pneumonia
      following grippe, over 50, has had a funeral ceremony &amp; burial to-day—I
      sent a little ivy woven anchor &amp; white initials, to be laid on the corpse or
      coffin, as I took a notion to, &amp; was acquainted with him—Keep up the
      massages—am sitting here alone in my den—lots of fog here
      lately—My supper is coming—
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>March 1 early p m</em>—weather "same subject continued"
      to-day—have rec'd a letter<sup><a href="#loc.07758_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> from John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r5">5</a></sup> wh' I enclose—(also send Stead's<sup><a href="#n4113" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      "Review" &amp; a French and Italian pamphlet)—have just drink'd a mug of milk
      punch—dull &amp; heavy enough here—read the papers, &amp; read
      again—

   <p>1½ Have had my massage—Tom Harned<sup><a href="#n4146" id="r7">7</a></sup> is well &amp;
      flourishing—told me he is ready (&amp; favorable) to take the meter (for gas)
      &amp; make a good big thing for you &amp; Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r8">8</a></sup> &amp; all<sup><a href="#loc.07758_n4" id="r9">9</a></sup>—I take it wanted me to tell you—a heavy dark

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0871">2. Richard Watson Gilder
      (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <em>The Century</em>, from 1881 until his death. Whitman had met
      Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1955], 482). Whitman attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
      Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the <em>New York Tribune</em>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder
      one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
      delirium" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">Sunday, August 5, 1888</a>). For more about Gilder, see Susan L.

   <p id="n0129">5. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see

   <p id="n4113">6. William Thomas Stead
      (1849–1912) was a well-known English journalist and editor of <em>The Pall Mall Gazette</em> in the 1880s. He was a proponent of
      what he called "government by journalism" and advocated for a strong press that
      would influence public opinion and affect government decision-making. His
      investigative reports were much discussed and often had significant social
      impact. He has sometimes been credited with inventing what came to be called
      "tabloid journalism," since he worked to make newspapers more attractive to
      readers, incorporating maps, illustrations, interviews, and eye-catching
      headlines. He died on the <em>Titanic</em> when it sank in
      1912.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n4146">7. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel (1856–1914), was
      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on his relationship with Whitman, see
      Thomas Biggs Harned, <em>Memoirs of Thomas B. Harned, Walt
         Whitman's Friend and Literary Executor</em>, ed. Peter Van Egmond (Hartford:
      Transcendental Books, 1972).<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="n4284">8. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

      "worth millions of dollars." According to Bucke's reply on , the poet also enclosed an advertisement:

      thought you would come to something if you stuck to your business long
      enough!"<a href="#r9">[back]
