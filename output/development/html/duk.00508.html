      to keep my ears from freezing
      i never had even a slight attack
      i had a letter from george) saying
      he arrived safe and was
      staying at present at the hotel
      but had been to phelidelphe 
      and met one of his old army
      friends and went with him
      to try to get board at the same
      place with him but they were
      
      
      
      full of boarders so he hired
      a room in a private house for
      3 dollar  a week and has to get his meals
      as they dident  furnish meals
      this is in phelidelphee  they charged
      him 12 dollars per week at the hotel in camden
      and not extra at that georgy says
      he says he thinks he shall like his 
      position very well he went to

      and this where he was will stop
      and it was very bad cold ugly
      work purbasco  says Jeff<sup><a href="#duk.00422_n2" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      is having
      a great quantity of pipe made about
      20 miles from camden<sup><a href="#duk.00508_n20" id="r10">10</a></sup>
      and george
      could just as well inspect that
      and not neglect this in the least
      mr lane has wrote to Jeff and
      george wanted matt<sup><a href="#duk.00465_n9" id="r11">11</a></sup>
      to write
      to him that george was there
      if he could put any thing in
      his way i told matt but
      
      
      
      whether she mentioned it to
      Jeff or not she said mr Lane had
      wrote to him but she would but
      walt if you write to Jeff you
      can speak about it) perbasko

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00508_n17">1. This letter dates to
      November 19, 1867. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to November 19, 1867,
      and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:378). November 19 fell on Tuesday in 1867, the day of the week given in Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Bucke's and Miller's date is consistent with the
      expected appearance of Walt Whitman's "Democracy" tomorrow (the 20th) in the
      following month's issue of the <em>Galaxy</em> 4 ([December 1867],
      919–933) and with George Washington Whitman's having just acquired a copy
      of a recent review, Robert Buchanan's "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1867/anc.00065.html">Walt Whitman</a>" (<em>The Broadway</em> 1 [November 1867],
      188–195).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00508_n18">2. Walt Whitman's letter is
      not extant.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00475_n11">4. Mustard plasters were a
      mustard paste that was applied to a cloth or paper, which was then applied to
      skin, generally with an intervening layer of cloth or paper. The paste,
      sometimes diluted, was typically applied to the abdomen and was held to relieve
      pain by increasing bloodflow or by drawing excess blood from the inflamed or
      painful area. Mustard, a strong irritant, would produce blisters if allowed to
      remain in contact with skin. See <em>Health at Home, or Hall's
         Family Doctor</em> (Hartford: J. A. S. Betts, 1873), 297.<a href="#r4">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00508_n7">6. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      spelling "perbasco" probably refers to Louis Probasco, formerly employed at
      Brooklyn Water Works, who is mentioned in Thomas Jefferson Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00508_n3">7. Charles Williams Kingsley
      (1833–1885) was a contractor for the Brooklyn Water Works.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00508_n19">8. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. George Whitman's original connection to Moses Lane was
      through his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      wrote to Walt Whitman on  that
      "jeff says as long as lane is in the water works georgey will be." For Walt
      Whitman's dealings with Lane, see his  letter to Jeff.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">9. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="duk.00508_n20">10. The pipe for the St. Louis
      Water Works was being made at the R. D. Wood Foundry in Florence, New Jersey.
      Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, chief engineer at the St. Louis Water Works,
      had inquired of his brother, "did you see our 36" pipe and if so what did you
      think of them" (see Jeff's 
      letter to George Washington Whitman).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">11. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00508_n9">12. Anna Van Wycke had boarded
      with the Whitmans in Brooklyn, and her parents' farm was near Colyer farm, which
      had belonged to Jesse Whitman, Walt Whitman's paternal grandfather. See Bertha
      H. Funnel, <em>Whitman on Long Island</em> (Port Washington, New
      York: Kennikat Press, 1971), 78.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00508_n10">13. "mr and mrs marten" may
      have been John D. Martin, an engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works, and his
      spouse. See Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear

   <p id="duk.00508_n14">14. Mr. Hamblen (or Hambler)
      lived in the same boarding house as Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. In her  letter, she described a terrible
      smell, which Mr. Hamblen blamed on the "privys" backing up on Pacific
      Street.<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00508_n22">15. Smith, a carpenter, was a

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00508_n23">17. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      may have stricken the word "that," but it is more likely that she wrote a single
      crossbar for both letters t, which though through the body of the word's letters
      was not intended to cancel the word "that." Her strikethrough method was
      generally more deliberate than a single line.<a href="#r17">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00508_n15">18. In early December 1867, the
      United States House of Representatives debated whether to take up articles of
      impeachment against President Andrew Johnson. The House impeached Johnson on
      February 24, 1868.<a href="#r18">[back]

      "Democracy," <em>The Galaxy</em> 4 (December 1867), 919–933;
      reprinted in <em>Democratic Vistas</em> (Washington: Walt Whitman,
      1871).<a href="#r20">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00470_n8">21. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
      and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r21">[back]
