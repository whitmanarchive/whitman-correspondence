      afternoon—Aug 22. 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I suppose you got the letter last Wednesday, I sent—I have written a few
      words to Han<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r1">1</a></sup>. continues very hot here, and is now dry
      again—nothing new with me—I am sitting in the office, writing this, Thursday
      afternoon—I keep quiet as possible—for if one stirs two steps, the sweat runs
      off him—It is 3 o'clock—there is a little air stirring to-day, but out doors it
      is like an over—John Burroughs<sup><a href="#duk.00659_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> has just been in to see
      me—he comes in most every day—Mother, I hope you will not get affected by the
      heat—By accounts it must be worse in New York than anywhere else—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Friday noon, Aug. 23.</p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I just rec'd your letter—I hope by the time you get this, you will get the
      things<sup><a href="#duk.00659_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I want to come—perhaps about the
      31st—(but if you all are not to rights I will put it off another week.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When you write again tell me whether Ed has recovered his spirits—Mother, it is
      always disagreeable to make a great change, &amp; especially for old folks, but a little
      time gets things working smoothly, &amp; then one is glad of the change, &amp; better
      off—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am feeling quite well to-day—the weather is pleasanter—had a good sleep last
      night—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think Grant stock is steadily going up, &amp; Greeley<sup><a href="#duk.00659_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> stock
      down, here &amp; every where—
   </p>

      Love to you, mama dear, &amp; to Lou<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n0368" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; all,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0285">1. Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908),
      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00659_n1">2. On August 16, 1872, Burroughs wrote to
      Dowden: "Walt Whitman is back again from his brief summer vacation but I am
      sorry to say is not as well as I should like to see him" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin Company, 1931], 74).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00659_n2">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Eddy had
      moved to Camden to live with George and Louisa.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00659_n3">4. Horace Greeley (1811–1872) ran
      against Grant for the Presidency in 1872.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0368">5. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
