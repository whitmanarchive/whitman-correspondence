      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was at home yesterday as usual &nbsp;everything is going on about the same. Andrew has
      recovered in a great measure,<sup><a href="#loc.00393_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> so that he sits up and would probably have been out-doors but the weather has been
      very wet and cold here for the last week. Mother herself I think is not very well.
      she has a bad cold that seems to pull her down. I have got one of the worst colds
      I ever had, and feel extremely unlike myself, still anything of that kind sits lighter
      on me than on one of Mother's age, and this morning Ed. seemed to be quite sick, that
      is he couldn't eat and complained of a bad pain in his side, however Mother put a
      mustard plaster on him and he felt considerably better when I left home.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mattie and George, the rest of "the family" are well. The Mr Brown<sup><a href="#loc.00393_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> who has rented the lower part of the house has sent a number of things to the house,
      carpets &amp;c. Mother has let him fix the front parlor and she has emigrated and taken
      posession of your room. The Moore people<sup><a href="#loc.00393_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> have not moved yet, and I believe do not intend to till 7 of May
   </p>
   
   <p>The Water Works men are all trembling in our boots, the [prospects?] being that we
      are all going to be kicked out, neck and heels, from the chief down to the Axeman.
      It seems that Mr F. Spinola<sup><a href="#loc.00393_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> started a bill at Albany some time last winter trying to oust the new commissioners
      (King, Lewis &amp;c &amp;c)<sup><a href="#loc.00393_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> &nbsp;well someone made an amendment casting out the present old Com. the new Com. Chief
      Eng. &amp;c all the way through, and appointing Mr McElroy<sup><a href="#loc.00393_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> in place of Mr Kirkwood.<sup><a href="#loc.00393_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> It has passed one house, and I guess the chances are abt even for its passing the other, as Wells the Contractor<sup><a href="#loc.00393_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> is helping it with all the power he can muster. I think it will be a dark day for
      the B. W. W. if he succeeds, but I suppose to the victor belongs the spoils. I know
      I ain't going to worry, if it does go through.<sup><a href="#loc.00393_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother wants me to be sure and tell you that you must bring her one of those books
      by the authoress of "Consuelo"<sup><a href="#loc.00393_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> also Redpath's "<em>John Brown</em>"<sup><a href="#loc.00393_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup> &nbsp;she says you needn't send them as that would involve cost, but to surely remember
      to bring them with you when you come home.
   </p>
   
   <p>I read your letter at home.<sup><a href="#loc.00393_n12" id="r12">12</a></sup> I am glad that you are having so good a time and that your book has such a good prospect
      of success. I sincerely hope you will meet with no disappointment.
   </p>
   
   <p>Write me again Walt. I like much to hear how you are getting along. I shall write
      to you again probably next week. Mattie sends her love.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00393_n1">1. Jeff writes in a letter
      to Walt from , that "Andrew has been
      very sick but was getting better on Sunday when I was home. His disease
      commenced by a very violent pain in the side, kept up and made worse by an
      ignorent Dr. and those around him." An alcoholic, Andrew would die of
      tuberculosis or perhaps throat cancer on December 3, 1863.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00393_n2">2. John Brown was a tailor
      whom Jeff came to despise; see Thomas Jefferson Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman
      dated .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00393_n3">3. Jeff refers here either
      to E. D. or John Moore, both of whom lived on Myrtle Avenue.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00393_n4">4. A member of the New
      York legislature from 1855 to 1861, Francis B. Spinola (1821–1891) later
      became a brigadier general during the Civil War, and finally a United States
      congressman from 1887 to 1891.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00393_n5">5. The four members of the
      Brooklyn Board of Water and Sewer Commissioners were Gamaliel King, William B.
      Lewis, John H. Funk, and Daniel L. Northrup.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00393_n6">6. Samuel McElroy preceded
      Kirkwood as chief engineer of what was the Nassau Water Company (later the
      Brooklyn Water Works). McElroy resigned his position on June 10, 1856, at which
      time Kirkwood took over.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00393_n7">7. James P. Kirkwood
      (1807–1877), a prominent civil engineer and cofounder of the American
      Society of Civil Engineers (1852), superintended the construction of the
      Brooklyn Water Works as chief engineer from 1856 to 1862. After his work in
      Brooklyn, he moved to St. Louis and designed the waterworks which Jeff would
      later build. Kirkwood eventually became a nationally known independent
      consultant and wrote the standard text on water filtration.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00393_n8">8. In 1856 Henry S. Welles
      &amp; Co. signed a contract with the Nassau Water Company to build a waterworks
      for Brooklyn. Welles was the main contractor for the project from its beginning
      to its completion in 1862.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00393_n9">9. Since Kirkwood and the
      others remained in their positions, the bill apparently did not pass.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00393_n10">10. Walt Whitman may have
      loaned Louisa Van Velsor Whitman his two-volume edition of George Sand's <em>The Countess of Rudolstadt</em> (New York: William H. Graham,
      1848). These volumes were in the poet's library at his death.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00393_n11">11. James Redpath
      (1833–1891) was the author of <em>The Public Life of Capt.
         John Brown</em> (Boston: Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the
      <em>New York Tribune</em> during the war, the originator of
      the "Lyceum" lectures, and editor of the <em>North American
         Review</em> in 1886. He met Whitman in Boston in 1860 (Thomas Biggs Harned
      Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #90) and remained
      an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, ed. Sculley Bradley (New York: Rowman and Littlefield,
      1961), 3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp."
      See also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins, 1926)
      and John R. McKivigan, <em>Forgotten Firebrand: James Redpath and
         the Making of Nineteenth-Century America</em> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell
      University Press, 2008). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman acknowledged receiving the
      "life of john brown" from Walt Whitman on May 3 (?), 1860. For more information
      on Redpath see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_46.html">Redpath, James [1833–1891]</a>."<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00393_n12">12. Jeff probably refers
      to a lost letter from Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
