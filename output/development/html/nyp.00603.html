   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="nyp.00603_n2">3. On the following day,
      Ellen O'Connor wrote at length of her husband's physical and emotional state: "I
      am sorry that I have not better news to give you of William. He has failed very
      much in the last six weeks, indeed I date the marked change for the worse from
      the paralysis of the eye lid, &amp; that was the last of Sept. but a very marked
      change for the worse since Nov. 23d. No one is as well aware of it as I am, for
      I see him at his worst, as well as his best. I am his sole &amp; only nurse,
      &amp; help to dress, undress &amp; bathe him, &amp; he is under no restraint to
      say how he does feel to me, tho' he <em>always</em> puts the best
      face on things to every one, &amp; is always ready to joke about himself &amp;
      often makes me laugh when I am ready to cry. . . . Until lately, too, he has had
      the most wonderful courage, &amp; would <em>not</em> give up, but
      it is not so all the time now. Still, there is one thing in his favor, (if one
      so regards it) &amp; that is that he is still <em>determined</em>
      to live. I never saw such clinging to <em>this life</em>, in any
      one; &amp; he still feels that if the right Doctor could be found that he could
      be made entirely well. He counted up the other day, &amp; found that he had had
      <em>fifteen</em> doctors. . . . But his deepest unhappiness
      now is that he has not yet been able to get his article published which he wrote
      in defense of Ignatius Loyola Donnelly [<em>Mr. Donnelly's
         Reviewers</em>]" (see O'Connor's letter to Whitman of ).<a href="#r3">[back]
