   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

<div class="editorial_notes">
   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00513_n14">1. This letter dates to
      February 17, 1868. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "monday 17," and
      Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to February 17, 1868. Edwin Haviland
      Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:365). February 17, 1868 fell on Monday. Louisa had received daughter Mary Van
      Nostrand's February 15, 1868 letter, and the month and year are consistent with
      multiple letter topics: Congressional debate on President Andrew Johnson's
      impeachment, Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's February 13, 1868 letter from
      St. Louis, and the recent death of Elizabeth Hegamen.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00513_n19">2. Neither letter from Walt
      Whitman to his mother, the one mailed Sunday, February 16, 1868, or the one that
      arrived in Brooklyn on Saturday, presumably mailed the previous Thursday or
      Friday (February 13 or 14), is extant.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00513_n20">3. The "papers" are
      newspapers. See the discussion of President Andrew Johnson's impeachment
      below.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00513_n21">4. <em>Harper's
         Weekly</em> debuted in 1857. Though designed like its sister monthly to
      promote British reprints, <em>Harper's Weekly</em> was notable for
      its Civil War coverage and began publishing American writers in the ensuing
      decades. Walt Whitman's poem "Beat! Beat! Drums!" appeared in the September 28,
      1861 issue of the newspaper, and two poems by Whitman were first published in
      the periodical in the 1880s (for all works by Whitman, see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_titles/per.00162.html"><em>Harper's Weekly Magazine</em></a>).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">5. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00440_n3">6. Manahatta Whitman
      (1860–1886), known as "Hattie," was the daughter of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven years of her life in
      the same home with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was especially close to her
      grandmother. Hattie and her younger sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957) were
      both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00513_n16">7. In her February 13, 1868
      letter from St. Louis, Mattie Whitman reported that she had located a rental
      house and a nearby school for daughter Manahatta (see Randall H. Waldron, ed.,
      <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1977], 46–48).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00513_n3">8. This instance is the only
      time that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman used the nickname "Molly" for her elder
      daughter Mary (Whitman) Van Nostrand (1821–1899), but it was Mary's
      nickname. In mid-February, the illness and expected death of Fanny Van Nostrand
      (Mary's husband Ansel's mother) had delayed Mary's plans for a visit to Louisa.
      However, Mary promised—were Louisa to request a visit—that "you will
      see molly quick" (see Mary's February 15, 1868 letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman, Trent Collection, Duke University). Louisa also informed Walt Whitman
      that weather would delay her daughter's visit: "mary hasent come yet the weather
      has been very bad indeed so i think she could not have got here last sunday was
      awfull" (see her  letter to
      Walt). Mary, Walt Whitman's younger sister, married Ansel Van Nostrand, a
      shipwright, in 1840, and they lived in Greenport, Long Island. Mary and Ansel
      had five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and Isadore "Minnie." See
      Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp;
         Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> (Durham, North
      Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949), 206.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00467_n1">9. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00513_n17">10. Charles L. Heyde rejected
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's proposal for Hannah Heyde's visit to Brooklyn.
      Louisa wrote in a  letter to Walt
      Whitman that her request to Heyde had "stirred him up."<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">11. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00513_n13">12. George Washington Whitman
      had rented a room from Elizabeth Hegeman when he returned to Brooklyn, New York
      after the Civil War in 1865 (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). Hegeman
      died on Thursday, February 13, 1868 at the age of 73 ("Died," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, February 14, 1868, 3).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00513_n6">13. Andrew Johnson
      (1808–1875) became President of the United States after the assassination
      of Abraham Lincoln in 1865. Johnson was the first president to be impeached, but
      the Radical Republican efforts to remove him from office ultimately failed.
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman alludes to the <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Eagle</em>'s Democratic Party leanings and to its opposition to Johnson's
      impeachment. Louisa read widely in political news: she subscribed to the <em>Eagle</em> and at various times also read the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>New York
         Herald</em>, and the <em>Brooklyn Daily Union</em>. Walt
      Whitman in his  letter had advised
      his mother to "take a morning paper, the Times or something" because the debates
      on Johnson's impeachment "are quite interesting now." According to Louisa's  letter to Walt, she was also
      reading the <em>Washington Star</em>, presumably a copy that Walt
      had forwarded.<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00513_n7">14. Ulysses Simpson Grant
      (1822–1885) was the highest ranking Union general of the Civil War. As
      commander of the Army of the Potomac, he accepted the surrender of Robert E. Lee
      at Appomattox. Grant was elected to two consecutive terms as president, in 1868
      and in 1872.<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00513_n15">15. The "chronicle" that Walt
      forwarded with impeachment news is presumably a Washington daily newspaper, the
      <em>Morning Chronicle</em>, which was published from 1862 to
      1874. Walt published a promotional piece about himself in the <em>Sunday Morning Chronicle</em> on May 9, 1869, and he wrote that he was
      working on a revised <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:80–81, n. 14).<a href="#r15">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00470_n8">16. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
      and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r16">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">17. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r17">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">18. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r18">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00432_n9">19. Walter Whitman, Sr.,
      (1789–1855) married Louisa Van Velsor in 1816. Walter, Sr., was a
      free-thinker and rationalist who rejected organized religion. He and Louisa had
      nine children, of whom Walt was the second. For more information on Walter, see
