      <br></br><br></br>Mr Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>You may be surprised in receiving this from me but seeing your name in the paper the
      other day I could not resist the temptation of writing to you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You undoubtedly can bring to mind the gloomy winter of 1'62 and –3 and of your many
      visits to the different Hospitals in and about Washington I was an inmate of Armory
      Square Hospital and always occupied a bed by the side of Louis K. Brown  the boy that suffered
      so much with a "Compound Fracture" of the leg and after laying months and months had
      it amputated at last
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My kind friend (for so you must permit me to call you) I have thought of you many
      times since I left Washington and how well can I remember you as you came into the
      Wards with the Haversack under your arm giving some little 
      nesessary
      
       here, a kind word there, and when you came to Louis<sup><a href="#loc.01920_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>  bed and mine how 
      cordialy
      
       you grasped [
      <span class="unclear">our</span>]
       hands
      and anxiously  enquired
      into our condition. I thank you for all this and you in your lonely moments must be
      happy in thinking of the good you have done to the many suffering ones during the
      war
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will now close for perhaps you may never receive this but if you do let me hear
      from you if it is convenient.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>May God 
      bless
      
       you kind friend and in [illegible] through [illegible] you have the kindest
      [
      <span class="unclear">regards</span>]
       of your humble
      [
      <span class="unclear">servant</span>]
      ,
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Hiram Sholes (1843–?) served
      as a private in the 26th Regiment, New York Infantry, and was apparently
      admitted into a home for disabled volunteer soldiers in 1867.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01920_n1">1. Perhaps a reference to Lewis
      Brown, who Whitman in his letter to Sholes of  describes as being well: "I see him often. He has a place here as
      Clerk, at $1200 a year. He is in the 4th Auditor's Office, Treasury Department,
      &amp; that is his address."<a href="#r1">[back]
