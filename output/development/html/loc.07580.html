   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n3039">2. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4137">4. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

   <p id="uva.00476_n1">5. Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n3115">6. Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935)
      was a translator and poet from France, who commented positively not only on
      Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and
      apparently liked the critic's work on <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>—Whitman even had Sarrazin's chapter on his book translated
      twice. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="n0259">7. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.07580_n2">8. <em>The
         Atlantic Monthly</em>, LX (1887), 275–281, contained a judicious
      review of <em>Anne Gilchrist</em>, but the writer took exception
      to her enthusiasm for Whitman's creed: "But we think she was wrong,
      fundamentally, in her philosophy; for materialism, however far it may be
      developed, never has accounted, and never can account, for the sons of God"
      (280). Whitman considered the review "malodorous" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.45.html">Wednesday, March 6, 1889</a>).<a href="#r8">[back]

      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt

      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07580_n3">12. See Rolleston's letter to
      Whitman of . On , Rolleston informed the poet that he had
      just returned the proofs to the publisher and that he would send on thirty
      copies of the German translation (Feinberg).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07580_n4">13. The notice appeared on
      February 9 and was written by Francis M. Larned (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.68.html">Friday, March 29, 1889</a>). Whitman pronounced it "a noble piece
      indeed: that man knows, understands!" (<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.31.html">Wednesday, February 20, 1889</a>). Larned's review was euologistic,
      though, not especially perceptive—the response of an idolator who
      admired the person as much as the poet: "With 'November Boughs' the work of
      Walt Whitman may be considered finished. The age of the poet (he was born in
      1819), his infirmity, the suggestive title of the volume, and the character
      of its contents all indicate that it is the final word, the last farewell,
      of one who awaits death with the tranquil mind and the clear vision of the
      prophet. . . .<br><br>"It is impossible to contemplate the life of this man,
      with a thorough knowledge of his work or even with an imperfect realization
      of it, without experiencing a feeling of profound and reverential respect.
      But we are too near him now to get other than an imperfect view of him: his
      personality is so great that it crowds the narrow field of our vision; to be
      adequately grasped and appreciated he must be seen in the perspective of at
      least one hundred years. His figure then will be sharply outlined against
      the background of history, and the future will see with unshaded eye and in
      a light softened and tempered by time that of which the present can get but
      a partial view." (Edwin Haviland Miller credits the Newberry Library for
      Larned's notice.)<a href="#r13">[back]
