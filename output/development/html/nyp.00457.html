   <p>Publishers secured—(not in the front rank at all, but young, experienced, &amp;
      I guess square &amp; the proposition to take the book comes vehemently from
      them)—Rees Welsh &amp;

      pub:
      
       of law books &amp; some others)—<em>Satisfactory to
         me, as I see at present, &amp; in prospect</em>. They are to publish L of G.
      same style as O[sgood]'s 
      ed'n, same price, from my plates, &amp; pay me 35 
      cts
      
       a
      copy royalty—They are also to publish immediately my prose writings, <em>Specimen Days, &amp; Collect</em>—a
      companion vol. to L of G. same price &amp; 
      ab't
      
       same size, for which they pay me 22
      
      cts
      
       royalty. They consider favorably the idea of publishing Dr. Bucke's book
      also—&amp; I think will do so—though they have not pledged
      themselves—
   </p>
   
   <p>By what I hear since I wrote last I think the enemy (in Boston)
      have formally appealed to the Post Master General to order L of G. excluded from the
      mails under the Comstock<sup><a href="#nyp.00457_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> statutes—I think the P M
      G has it before him—perhaps has already decided—I keep well—

   <p id="nyp.00457_n2">2. Anthony Comstock
      (1844–1915), the secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Vice in
      New York from 1873 to 1915, was the author of <em>Frauds
         Exposed</em> (1880) and <em>Morals Versus Art</em> (1887). On
       O'Connor informed Whitman that
      Ingersoll and he were drawing up a memorandum for the Postmaster General (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell
      Kennerley, 1914], 3:50). On  O'Connor
      reported that in Ingersoll's opinion Comstock "is not an honest bigot, but an
      arrant black-hearted scoundrel."<a href="#r2">[back]
