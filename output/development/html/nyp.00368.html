      This postcard bears the address, "Pete Doyle, | M street South—bet 4½
      &amp; 6th | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | May | 14 | (?);
      Carrier | May | 15 | (?) AM."<br><br>
      The correspondence (again chiefly postcards) with Doyle in April and May was
      sent on Fridays, according to Whitman's habit. At this time Doyle was
      working out of Baltimore; note Whitman's , and  letters to
      Doyle.<a href="#r1">[back]
