      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Through the kindness of one who I am proud to call a friend, and a Countryman of
      mine, I have an opportunity of writing to you, whose sentiments I agree with and
      whose works I admire. Mr. Rolleston and a Mr. Wilkins,<sup><a href="#loc.05095_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> two students of Trinity
      College, Dublin, were the first to draw my attention to your poetical works, of
      which I wish to say a few words. I am an ardent student of the Russian Language, and
      greatly interested in the huge country and its strange people and history. Your book
      is the book for them. Will you allow me to translate the "Leaves of Grass" into
      Russian.<sup><a href="#loc.05095_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> It will do good, of that I am perfectly sure. I know the Russian character,
      and say again that the "Leaves of Grass" is the book for them. Awaiting the favour
      of a reply
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      I am, dear Sir,
      <br></br>Your sincerely,
      <br></br>J. Fitzgerald Lee<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.05095_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
