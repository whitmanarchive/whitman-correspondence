   </p>
   
   <p>I wish I cd give your dear hand a good grip to-day, I am now reading 1st proof at
      Riverside Press,—a nice berth for me. I have abt 10 minutes a day to my self! I find
      that that Gardner<sup><a href="#n4318" id="r2">2</a></sup> publishes highly respectable <u>religious</u> books
      (not our cosmic=pantheistic kind, of course)! I suppose Fredk. Wilson<sup><a href="#loc.03316_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> has my <u>MS</u> now.<sup><a href="#col.00006_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> Am going to
      take a vacation in a month. Do drop me a line dear &amp; revered papa, &amp; relieve my
      anxiety abt you.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      contentious battle with Kennedy over editing the book. Gardner published and
