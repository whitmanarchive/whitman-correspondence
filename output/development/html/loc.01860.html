   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mrs. Henry Reynolds's son Walter Whitman Reynolds
      wrote to Whitman on , , and . In this last letter, Reynolds begged Whitman, "friend Walt I
      want to know if you will be kind enough loan me twenty dollars as I want to get
      a pair of pants and a coat." If Whitman replied, his letters are not extant.
      According to Whitman's daybook, his namesake Reynolds visited him on September
      1, 1889.
