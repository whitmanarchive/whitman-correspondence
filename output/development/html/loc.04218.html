      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In December I received from you a post-card, under date St Louis 
      Misouri
      
      
      
      Nov
      
       20, saying that you had been detained from home by illness but would soon
      return, when you would send to me the two books (<u>Vistas</u>
      &amp; <u>Memoranda</u>) which I wrote to you
      for back in the fall.<sup><a href="#n3025" id="r1">1</a></sup> Since that I have not heard from you—this makes me rather
      anxious to know that you are still getting on towards recovering your health—I am
      very glad indeed that you have had such a "good time" in the west of the
      States, but it would be [
      <span class="unclear">sad?</span>]
       if you were to be ill for long as a consequence of your
      travel.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have now sent you a post office order for 21 shillings—This is for your
      second volume of the complete Edition of 1875 ("<u>Two
         Rivulets</u>") I have a very dear cousin Ethel
      Thompson—who lately became 21 years old. That is an
      occasion for rejoicing and congratulating people over here. I don't know why. I
      think people ought to be condoled with, rather. Anyhow, it is also the practice to
      cheer them up with presents—and, as I believed that your "Leaves of Grass"
      would give my cousin more pleasure than anything else I could give her, I gave her
      that book.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But her sister—another woman who is dear to me—Honora Thompson—had
      thought just the same and gave her the same book! So I have taken back "Leaves of
      Grass" and am going to keep it as a <u>loan copy</u>. That is a
      copy to lend to those who know little about your poems and want to know more.
   </p>
   
   <p>And I am going to give to Ethel Thompson "Two Rivulets" so that she will be the
      gainer by [
      <span class="unclear">two?</span>]
      
      of her friends' having determined
      to give her Whitman as a birthday present.
   </p>
   
   <p>I want you, if you will, to write in the book "Ethel Thompson from Joseph William
      Thompson, December the 15<u>th</u>
      1879" and, having written this, to sign it with your own name and the actual date
      of
      your so signing. Do you mind doing this for me and then sending it off by post
      to—
      <br><br>Ethel Thompson
      <br>Charles Thompson—esquire—
      <br>Preswylfa
      <br>near Cardiff
      <br>England.
   </p>
   
   <p> I shall be very grateful to you, but not so grateful as I am for your having written
      what you have written
      (in your book, I mean).
   </p>
   
   <p>Honora Thompson tells me that she was not able satisfactorily to answer two questions
      which you put to her about the selection of your poems made by Mr W. M. Rossetti,<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r2">2</a></sup> I can tell you. The book is out of
      print and the publishers—[
      <span class="unclear">Messrs?</span>]
       Chatto and Windus (of Piccadilly—
      London) have
      definitely answer'd the question as to whether they were going to republish it in
      the <u>negative</u>.
   </p>
   
   <p>You say that you never received any thing from the publishers on account of that
      selection. But do you think that a profit was made? From the manner in which Mr Rossetti writes in the preface, I should think it very
      possible that it was a 'labour
      
       of love' on his part to bring the book out, and that he neither hoped for
      nor got any gain excepting the knowledge that he had done his best to make your works
      better known in England.
   </p>
   
   <p>That is how it <u>seems</u> to me—I <u>know</u> nothing.
   </p>
   
   <p>But many in England are anxious that there should be a <u>good</u>
      selection of your poems in a popular form, so that all may gradually get knowledge
      of them. I who write to you am young (26) and inexperienced. I have lately abandoned
      my intention—half-formed—of trying to earn my living at the
      bar—and I am uncertain what work I shall do. But
      <u>some</u> work, some good to the world, I will try to do.
      Amongst other things, if it is not done before I can put my hand to it, I will, if
      you will give me leave, make and bring out a selection of your poems and sell it at
      a cheap price. People will not give 10 dollars—or 5—for that of which
      they know nothing. And thus you <u>remain</u> an unknown writer
      to the great mass of Englishmen and Englishwomen. I hope that, come time, I shall
      write to you for your permission—At present, I cannot undertake this
      work—I want to have a more thorough knowledge—such knowledge as the
      digesting by time can alone give—of your poems, and I need not add that if it
      came in my path to come to America to see you, it is a chance which I should very
      eagerly grasp at. That may possibly
      happen in the summer of next year. I do not know.
   </p>
   
   <p>Meanwhile, a Mr Lewin<sup><a href="#loc.04218_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> of Birkenhead, who edits a small
      quarterly magazine called "Papers for the Times" seems to wish to reprint here the
      "Preface to Leaves of Grass" which you have omitted from all your later
      editions—May I ask you why you have omitted it? I know that you have
      practically embodied some of it in your other poems—but not all of it. I
      myself do not know whether your <u>preface</u> is in reality a
      preface—something good to prefix—or itself a poem just as much as the
      other poems are. I have thought that that might be the reason for your no longer
      printing it as a preface. I have told Mr
      Lewin that I would ask you as to your wishes with
      regard to it being reprinted. I must tell you that Mr Lewin or whoever should undertake it would <u>in</u>
      <u>all</u>
      <u>probability</u> have no margin of profit, but (probably) a
      margin the other way—But if I, personally, had anything to do with the
      publishing, I should make it a condition that any profit that there might be should
      be handed over to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am afraid that my letter is growing to a much-too-great size, but there is one more
      topic. Mr Edward Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r4">4</a></sup> has been so kind as to lend
      me Mr Burroughs's<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r5">5</a></sup> "Walt Whitman as Poet and Person"<sup><a href="#n0834" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      which I have read with very great interest. Mr Child<sup><a href="#n1054" id="r7">7</a></sup> (I
      think his name is) at 
      Trubner's (the publisher's) says that he believes you have the
      remaining stock of these books. Is this so? If so, will you kindly send me a copy,
      to
      this address
      (Goldsmith Building, Temple, London) and let me know what I owe you for it. Mr Carpenter's copy of the book (1867) was 
      pubd
      
       by the American News Company,<sup><a href="#n0037" id="r8">8</a></sup> but I have seen it spoken
      of as being published by J.S. Redfield<sup><a href="#n0499b" id="r9">9</a></sup>—in 1871. Perhaps that is
      a later edition.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3025">1. Joseph William Thompson was a
      lawyer from London and member of the Middle Temple, one of the four Inns of
      Court of the city. He was called to the bar in 1879. Thompson was the 5th son of
      Charles Thompson of Preswylfa near Cardiff, a member of the Society of Friends
      (Joseph Foster, <em>Men-at-the-bar: A Biographical Hand-list of
         the Members of the Various Inns</em> [London and Avlesbury: Hazell, Watson
      and Viney, Limited, 1885], 464).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">2. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04218_n1">3. Walter Lewin's quarterly on
      "Literature, Philosophy and Religion" also published Frank W. Walters's essay
      "Walt Whitman." Lewin did end up publishing Whitman's 1855 preface in his
      journal in 1880 (with Trübner &amp; Co. as the publisher). Lewin turned out
      to be an avid reviewer of Whitman, too, highly praising <em>Leaves
         of Grass</em> in a <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1881/anc.00221.html">September 1887 review</a> and <em>Specimen Days and
         Collect</em> in <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/days/anc.00111.html">June 1887</a>, <em>Democratic Vistas, and Other Papers</em>
      in <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/dvpapers/anc.00112.html">1888</a> as well as <em>November Boughs</em> in <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/novboughs/anc.00224.html">1889</a>. Whitman himself was little impressed, calling Lewin's piece on
      <em>November Boughs</em> "very shallow, superficial, [...]
      too!" and saying to Richard Maurice Bucke, "Doctor you had better take it: you
      are the fellow who adopts all the foundlings!" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection;
      Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953), 4:274–275).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0141b">4. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">5. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0834">6. John Burroughs's <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/burroughs/works/anc.00248.html"><em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em></a>
      was first published in New York in 1867. The text was extensively revised and
      rewritten by Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1054">7. Whitman's dealings with
      Trübner &amp; Company were handled through Josiah Child. Trübner &amp;
      Company was the London agent for Whitman's books; see Whitman's , letter to Trübner &amp;
      Company.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0037">8. The American News Company was a New York
      magazine—and later comic book—distribution company founded in 1864 by Henry
      Dexter (1813–1910). The American News Company published John Burroughs's
      <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em> in
      1867.<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="n0499b">9. James S. Redfield, a publisher at 140 Fulton
      Street, New York, was a distributor of Whitman's books in the early 1870s. On
      March 23, 1872, Redfield accepted 496 copies of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>: "I am to account to him (for all that I may sell) at the rate of
      One Dollar &amp; Fifty Cents a copy, (1.50)" (Charles E. Feinberg
