      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thanks to you for your kind p.c + for your long + interesting letter both of which
      I
      received yesterday—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am much grieved to hear of the death of your brother Jefferson<sup><a href="#n4995" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      which must have been a heavy blow to you + one which I am sure you would feel most
      acutely. On behalf of the friends here + myself I desire to tender you our sincere
      +
      heartfelt sympathy in your sore bereavement. May the Great-Healer + Consoler pour
      His [illegible] into your wounded heart +
      give you of his sweet Peace + Comfort!
   </p>
   
   <p>I am also extremely sorry to hear of your continued indisposition + I hope that by
      this time things have taken a more favourable turn with you + that your strong faith +
      your vast store of long suffering patience, indomitable pluck and hopeful joyousness
      may bear you through these "gloomy blue days" as they have done so often before.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I received a good letter from Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> yesterday in which he
      gives me some professional details of your illness which were very welcome from a
      brother medico.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad that you like + endorse my Notes + I thank you cordially for your kindly
      remarks concerning them.
   </p>
   
   <p>It may interest you to know that "the boys" gave me a "surprise party" on the Evening
      of Dec. 8<u>th</u>—my birthday—+ presented me with a
      handsome "Literary machine"—a reading + writing stand—bearing a brass
      plate engraved "To John Johnston, Esq. M.D., 'Something for a token' From the Boys
      of the College. Bolton, Dec. 8<u>th</u> 1890."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>After the presentation + speeches R K Greenhalgh consecrated the stand by reading
      aloud from it a Manifesto written by J. W. Wallace<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r3">3</a></sup>—characterised as a Chieftan's call to arms—rousing us to a sense of
      the value + importance of our little Society of Friends + urging upon us the
      necessity for strengthening the bonds of mutual manly love + true Comradeship + the
      cultivation of the Higher Self. The rest of the evening was spent in
      merriment—songs recitations + social converse—two original humourous
      songs about "the Doctor" being contributed by W. Dixon.
   </p>
   
   <p>By this mail I am sending a parcel of Christmas literature for you + some of the
      other members of your household; also a copy of this week's <u>Bolton Journal</u> containing a short paragraph anent a pleasant evening we
      had at the Bolton Art Club when I gave the members + their friends an account of my visit to
      you +c, + exhibited your photo + [illegible]
      I took in America upon a 10 ft screen.
   </p>
   
   <p>I saw Fred. Wild last night. He sends his love + his sympathy to you + asked me to
      order a copy of the pocket book edition of <u>L. of G.</u> for
      him. His address is—Mr Fred. Wild, 24, Arrowsmith Terrace, Bolton, Lancashire,
      England, + I should be obliged if you would kindly send the book to him direct.
   </p>
   
   <p>Many thanks to you for kindly sending Mr Johnston's copy.</p>
   
   <p>I shall have great pleasure in sending a copy of my Notes to each of the friends
      whose names + addresses you have kindly favoured me with.
   </p>
   
   <p>With best love to you + kindest regards to all the members of your household +
      wishing you all a "Merry Christmas + a Happy New Year!"

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4995">1. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
