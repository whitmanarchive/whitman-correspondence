      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Friday morning, Jan. 2, 1863.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear sister,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>You have heard of my fortunes and misfortunes of course, (through my letters to mother
      and Jeff,) since I left home, that Tuesday afternoon. But I thought I would write
      a few lines to you, as it is a comfort to write home, even if I have nothing particular
      to say. Well, dear sister, I hope you are well and hearty, and that little sis keeps
      as well as she always had, when I left home, so far. Dear little plague, how I would
      like to have her with me, for one day. I can fancy I see her, and hear her talk. Jeff
      must have got a note from me about a letter I have written to the <em>Eagle</em>
      <sup><a href="#loc.00759_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—you may be sure you will get letters enough from me, for I have little else to do
      at present. Since I laid my eyes on dear brother George, and saw him alive and well—and
      since I have spent a week in camp, down there opposite Fredericks-burgh, and seen
      what well men and sick men, and mangled men endure—it seems to me I can be satisfied
      and happy henceforward if I can get one meal a day, and know that mother and all are
      in good health, and especially if I can only be with you again, and have some little
      steady paying occupation in N. Y. or Brooklyn.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am writing this in the office of Major Hapgood, way up in the top of a big high
      house, corner of 15th and F. street—there is a splendid view, away down south, of
      the Potomac river, and across to the Georgetown side, and the grounds and houses of
      Washington spread out beneath my high point of view. The weather is perfect—I have
      had that in my favor ever since leaving home—yesterday and to-day it is bright, and
      plenty warm enough. The poor soldiers are continually coming in from the hospitals,
      &amp;c. to get their pay—some of them waiting for it, to go home. They climb up here,
      quite exhausted, and then find it is no good, for there is no money to pay them—there
      are two or three paymasters desks in this room, and the scenes of disappointment are
      quite affecting. Here they wait in Washington, perhaps week after [week], wretched
      and heart sick—this is the greatest place of delays and puttings off, and no finding
      the clue to any thing—this building is the paymaster general's quarters, and the crowds
      on the walk and corner, of poor sick, pale, tattered soldiers, are awful—many of them
      day after day, disappointed and tired out. Well, Mat, I will suspend my letter for
      the present, and go out through the city—I have a couple of poor fellows in the Hospital
      to visit also.

      Saturday evening, Jan 3d.
      </span>
   
   <p>I write this in the place where I have my lodging room, 394 L street, 4th door above
      14th street. A friend of mine, William D. O'Connor,<sup><a href="#loc.00759_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> has two apartments, on the 3d floor, very ordinarily furnished, for which he pays
      the <em>extra</em> ordinary price of $25 a month. I have a werry little bedroom on the 2d floor—Mr.
      &amp; Mrs. O'Connor and their little girl have all gone out "down town" for an hour or
      two, to make some Saturday evening purchases, and I am left in possession of the premises—so
      I sit by the fire, and scribble more of my letter. I have not heard any thing from
      dear brother George since I left the camp last Sunday morning, 28th Dec. I wrote to
      him on Tuesday last—I wish to get to him the two blue woolen shirts Jeff sent, as
      they would come very acceptable to him—and will try to do it yet. I think of sending
      them by mail, if the postage is not more than $1.
   </p>
   
   <p>Yesterday I went out to the Campbell Hospital to see a couple of Brooklyn boys, of
      the 51st. They knew I was in Washington, and sent me a note, to come and see them.
      O my dear sister, how your heart would ache to go through the rows of wounded young
      men, as I did—and stopt to speak a comforting word to them. There were about 100 in
      one long room, just a long shed neatly whitewashed inside. One young man was very
      much prostrated, and groaning with pain. I stopt and tried to comfort him. He was
      very sick. I found he had not had any medical attention since he was brought there—among
      so many he had been overlooked. So I sent for the doctor, and he made an examination
      of him—the doctor behaved very well—seemed to be anxious to do right—said that the
      young man would recover—he had been brought pretty low with diarroeha, and now had
      bronchitis, but not so serious as to be dangerous. I talked to him some time—he seemed
      to have entirely give up, and lost heart—he had not a cent of money—not a friend or
      acquaintance—I wrote a letter from him to his sister—his name is John A. Holmes,<sup><a href="#loc.00759_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Campbello, Plymouth county, Mass. I gave him a little change I had—he said he would
      like to buy a drink of milk, when the woman came through with milk. Trifling as this
      was, he was overcome and began to cry. Then there were many, many others. I mention
      the one, as a specimen. My Brooklyn boys were John Lowery, shot at Fredericksburgh,
      and lost his left forearm, and Amos H. Vliet<sup><a href="#loc.00759_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Jeff knows the latter—he has his feet frozen, and is doing well. The 100 are in a
      ward, (6.)—and there are, I should think, eight or ten or twelve such wards in the
      Campbell Hospital—indeed a real village. Then there are some 38 more Hospitals here
      in Washington, some of them much larger.

   <p>Mat, I hope and trust dear mother and all are well, and every thing goes on good home.
      The envelope I send, Jeff or any of you can keep for direction, or use it when wanted
      to write to me. As near as I can tell, the army at Falmouth remains the same.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00759_n1">1. "Our Brooklyn Boys in the
      War" appeared in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> on January 5,
      1863. It was a factual report of the activities of Brooklyn soldiers,
      particularly of Sims (see Whitman's letter from ) and George.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00759_n2">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an
      abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. He had been an
      assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> before he
      went to Washington. O'Connor was an intelligent man who deserved something
      better than the various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his
      death. The humdrum of clerkship, however, was relieved by the presence of
      Whitman whom he was to love and venerate—and defend with a single-minded
      fanaticism and outpourings of vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been
      equaled, most notably in his pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first,
      and in many ways the most important, of the adulators who divided people
      arbitrarily into two categories: those who were for and those who were against
      Walt Whitman. The poet praised O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous
      collection of his tales: "He was a born sample here in the 19th century of the
      flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his
      memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton,
      1910] pp. 513). For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00759_n3">3. Whitman related the
      harrowing story of Holmes's illness in the <em>New York
         Times</em>, February 26, 1863 (in <em>The Complete Writings of
         Walt Whitman</em>, 10 vols. [New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902],
      7:85–89). Though Holmes suffered from acute diarrhea, he remained with his
      regiment at Fredericksburg as long as he could. Finally he was evacuated (in
      Whitman's words, "dumped with a crowd of others on the boat at Aquia creek"),
      and was taken to Campbell Hospital, Washington, where Whitman met him on January
      4, 1863: "As I stopped by him and spoke some commonplace remark (to which he
      made no reply), I saw as I looked that it was a case for ministering to the
      affection first, and other nourishment and medicines afterward. I sat down by
      him without any fuss; talked a little; soon saw that it did him good; led him to
      talk a little himself; got him somewhat interested" (<em>The
         Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>,
      7:88).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00759_n4">4. According to Whitman's
      jottings in "New York City Veterans," Whitman discovered John Lowery (here
      spelled Lowerie) on December 22, 1862, "in the Hospital on the ground at
      Falmouth" (Charles I. Glicksberg, <em>Walt Whitman and the Civil
         War</em> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1933], 67). In <em>Specimen Days</em>, Whitman writes: "I saw him lying on the
      ground at Fredericksburg last December, all bloody, just after the arm was taken
      off. He was very phlegmatic about it, munching away at a cracker in the
      remaining hand—made no fuss" (<em>The Complete Writings of Walt
         Whitman</em>, 4:51). In
      the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> of March 19, 1863, Whitman gave
      a fuller account of Lowery; Whitman saw Amos H. Vliet in the hospital tent at
      Falmouth on December 22, 1862, and mentioned him briefly in this article (<em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>,
      7:95–96). According
      to his diary, Whitman wrote a (lost) Letter to Vliet on May 2, 1863
      (Glicksberg,
      133).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00759_n5">5. The <em>Monitor</em> foundered at sea on December 30, 1862. The report of the
      disaster was received in Washington on January 3, 1863.<a href="#r5">[back]
