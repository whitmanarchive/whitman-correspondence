   <p>Still here, pulling through the summer (I think the winter is better for
      me)—the hot sunny days are worst for me, an extra bad strange feeling every
      day in the head, (the doctor thinks probably the result of an old sunstroke 20 years
      ago—<u>now</u> the brain liable to it again, in its
      sensitive condition)—otherwise not much different—<u>bad enough though</u>. I still go out a little—(most always feel at the
      best, for me, evenings, from sundown to 10.) 
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I still keep a little at work—there is a printing office
      here,<sup><a href="#loc.01657_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> where I am doing my work—they are
      young men of the right stripe, &amp; very kind &amp; considerate &amp; respectful to
      me—fix every thing in type, proof, &amp;c. just to suit me—I am
      leisurely preparing my new Volume,—Mr. Marvin, an Internal Revenue Clerk, a friend
      of mine, has 
      stopt
      
       &amp; paid me a visit on his return to 
      Wash. Plenty of rain here—hot but pleasant to-day—What has become
      of Tasistro? Pete you 
      havn't
      
       made that call on Mrs. O'C. yet. Come
      when you can, my darling boy.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

         Rivulets</em> was set up in the <em>New Republic</em> Print
      Shop in Camden. Probably the "Walt Whitman Club in Camden" to which the
      Springfield <em>Republican</em> of July 23 referred, if it
      actually existed, consisted of "mechanics" employed by the local newspaper.
      Joseph B. Marvin also referred to this "club" in <em>The Radical
         Review</em> 1 (1877), 238. Undoubtedly Whitman gave him a copy of the <em>Republican</em> during his visit.<a href="#r2">[back]
