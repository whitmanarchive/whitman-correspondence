   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <p id="duk.00414_n1">1. 
      This letter dates to between May 2 and May 4, 1860, with the earlier dates
      having a higher probability. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter May 3,
      1860, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:53, n. 19). Bucke's date cannot be confirmed, but it must
      be very close.<br><br>
      Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in his  letter to Walt Whitman requested a copy of James Redpath's
      <em>The Public Life of Captain John Brown</em>. Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman in this letter acknowledged receiving the book "and all the
      money,"five dollars to assist with rent according to her  letter to Walt. Walt
      in his  letter to Jeff
      acknowledged receipt of "Mother's letter." These two facts narrow the range
      of possible dates for Louisa's letter to between the last few days of April
      and the first week of May. Multiple factors suggest a more narrow date
      range, immediately after May 1. The Brown family had begun to settle into
      the house, and they presumably moved very near May 1, the traditional moving
      day in Brooklyn. The newspaper coverage of a notable prize fight and the
      Democratic political convention, both of which Louisa pointedly excluded
      from her letter, were at their most intense from Saturday, April 28 through
      Monday, April 30.

   <p id="duk.00424_n21">2. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman had requested a copy of James Redpath's <em>The Public
         Life of Captain John Brown</em> (Boston: Thayer &amp; Eldridge, 1860) for
      his mother (see Jeff's  letter to
      Walt Whitman). Walt Whitman traveled to Boston in early March 1860 to oversee
      printing of the third edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> by
      Thayer &amp; Eldridge. For a detailed account of Whitman's time in Boston, see
      his  letter to Jeff Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00414_n22">4. Walt Whitman's reply from
      Boston to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter is not extant. Walt in his  letter to Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      indicated that he would return to Brooklyn soon, but his return was delayed
      until later in the month (see his  draft
      letter to William Wilde Thayer and Charles W. Eldridge).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00414_n20">5. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      wrote the descender of her letter "p" separately, but the bowl of her "p" is
      nearly indistinguishable from her letter "v." This similarity led her sometimes
      to switch the two letters. Here she added a descender to her intended "v," which
      makes the word "very" appear as "pery."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n13">7. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="duk.00414_n14">8. Rheumatism or arthritic
      rheumatism, which Louisa Van Velsor Whitman also spells "rheumattis" or
      "rhumatis," is joint pain, which was attributed to dry joints. See <em>Health at Home, or Hall's Family Doctor</em> (Hartford: J. A.
      S. Betts, 1873), 704.<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="duk.00423_n3">9. Andrew Jackson Whitman
      (1827–1863) was Walter Whitman, Sr., and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son,
      and Walt Whitman's brother. Andrew developed a drinking problem that contributed
      to his early death, leaving behind his wife Nancy McClure Whitman, who was
      pregnant with son Andrew, Jr., and their two sons, George "Georgy" and James
      "Jimmy." For more on Andrew, see Martin G. Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>

   <p id="duk.00424_n12">11. The "fight" was an April
      17, 1860 bare-knuckle boxing match between American John C. Heenan and
      Englishman Tom Sayers. Lasting over two hours and counted at 37 (or 42) rounds,
      but inconclusive because it was broken up by police, the match is considered the
      first international boxing championship (see "The Great Prize Fight," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, April 28, 1860, 2; "The Great
      Fight," <em>New York Times</em>, April 30, 1860, 8; and Elliot J.
      Gorn, <em>The Manly Art: Bare-Knuckle Prize Fighting in
         America</em>, updated edition [Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1986],
      148–159). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's "politicks" is the Charleston
      Democratic Convention, which began on April 23, 1860 and adjourned on May 3,
      1860. Despite a walkout by pro-slavery southern delegates after the adoption of
      a moderate pro-slavery platform, Stephen A. Douglas (1813–1861) was unable
      to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote to secure the nomination. Newspapers
      provided daily convention coverage and commentary.<a href="#r11">[back]

      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George

   <p id="duk.00424_n9">16. According to Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's  letter,
      the Brown family rented the "lower part" of the house. Louisa describes the
      portion of the house rented by the Browns later in this letter. John Brown, a
      tailor, and his family remained in the house for five years, but the
      relationship between the Browns and Jeff Whitman's family was often strained.
      Though Louisa too became frustrated with the Browns, she maintained cordial
      relations with them after Jeff and family departed for St. Louis.<a href="#r16">[back]

      Beecher's Plymouth Church. Beecher (1813–1887), Congregational clergyman
      and brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, accepted the pastorate of the Plymouth
      Church, Brooklyn, in 1847. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son Edward attended
      Beecher's church.<a href="#r17">[back]

      a stage driver, and Robert "Bob" Cooper was Vaughan's roommate. See Fred
      Vaughan's  letter to Walt Whitman.
      Vaughan was one of Walt's most important relationships from the Pfaff's period.
      Ed Folsom and Kenneth M. Price associate Vaughan with "the sequence of
      homoerotic love poems Whitman called 'Live Oak, with Moss'" (<em>Re-Scripting Walt Whitman: An Introduction to His Life and Work</em>
      [Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell, 2005], 62). For more on Vaughan, see Charley

   <p id="duk.00424_n18">19. Hector Tyndale
      (1821–1880), son of Sarah Tyndale and Robinson Tyndale, was a Philadelphia
      merchant like his father. During the Civil War, he played a significant role at
      the Battle of Antietam and rose to the rank of brigadier general in the Union
      Army. Walt Whitman described a meeting with him on February 25, 1857 (<em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: G. P.
      Putnam, 1902], 9:154–155). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman apparently made an
      impression on Tyndale. Walt wrote to his mother that Tyndale "has been to see me
      again—always talks about you" (see Walt's  letter to Louisa).<a href="#r19">[back]
