   <p>Yesterday <u>was</u> a day for me dearest Friend—In the
      morning your letter, strong cheerful reassuring—dear letter. In the afternoon
      the books, I 
      dont
      
       know how to settle down my thoughts calmly enough to write, nor how to lay
      down the books (with delicate yet serviceable exterior, with inscription making me
      so proud so joyous But there are a few things I want to say to you at  once in regard to our
      coming to America. I will not act without "further advice from you"; but as to not
      resolving on it dear Friend I can't exactly obey that, for it has been my [
      <span class="unclear">settled</span>]
      , steady
      purpose (resting on a deep strong faith) ever since 1869. Nor do I feel discouraged
      or surprised at what you say of American "crudeness," &amp;c. (of which, in truth,
      one hears not a little in England.) I have not shut my eyes to the difficulties and
      trials  &amp;
      responsibilities (for the 
      childrens
      
       sake) of the enterprise. I am not urged on by any discontent with old
      England or by any adverse circumstances here which I might hope to better
      there—my reasons, emotions, the sources of my strength and courage for the
      uprooting &amp; transplanting—all are inclosed in those two volumes that lie
      before me on the table. That America has brought them forth makes me want to plant
      some, at least, of my children on her soil. I understand &amp; believe in  &amp; love her in
      &amp; through them. They teach me to look beneath the surface &amp; to get hints of
      the great future that is shaping itself out of the crude present &amp; I believe we
      shall prove to be of the right sort to plant down there.—O to talk it all over
      with you dearest Friend here in London first; I feel as if that would really
      be—the joy the comfort of that. I cannot finish this today but send what I
      have written without delay that you may know of the safe arrival of the books.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
