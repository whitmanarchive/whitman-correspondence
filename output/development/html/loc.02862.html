      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The newspapers have both come to hand &amp; been gladly welcomed. I shall realize you
      on the 26th sending living impulses into those young
      men, with results not to cease—their kindled hearts sending back response
      through glowing eyes that will be warmer to you than the June sunshine. Perhaps,
      too, you will have pleasant talks with the eminent astronomers there. Prof.
      Young, who is so skilful  a worker with that most subtle fetcher
      of tidings from the Stars, the Spectroscope—always, it seems hitherto bringing
      word of the "vast similitude that interlocks all " nay of the absolute identity of
      the stuff they are made of with the stuff we are made of."—The news from
      Dartmouth, that too, is a great pleasure. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been what seems to me a very long while since last writing, because it has
      been a troubled time within &amp; what I wrote I tore up again, believing it was
      best wisest so—You said in  your first letter that if you had leisure you could write one
      that "would do me good &amp; you too"; write that letter dear Friend after you have
      been to Dartmouth—for I
      sorely need it. Perhaps the letters that I have sent you since that first, have
      given you a feeling of constraint towards me because you cannot respond to them. I
      will not write any more such letters; or, if I write them because my heart is so
      full it cannot bear it, they shall not find their way to the Post.  But do not, because I
      give you more than friendship, think that it would not be a very dear &amp; happy
      thing to me to have friendship only from you—I do not want you to write what
      it is any effort to write—do not ask for deep thoughts, deep
      feelings—know well those must choose their own time &amp; mode—but for
      the simplest current details—for any thing that helps my eyes to pierce the
      distance &amp; see you as you live &amp; move to-day. I dearly like to hear about
      your Mother—want to know if all  your sisters are married, &amp; if you have plenty of little
      nephews &amp; nieces—I like to hear anything about Mr. O'Connor &amp; Mr.
      Burroughs, towards both of whom I feel as toward friends. (Has Mr. O'Connor succeeded
      in getting practically adopted his new method of making cast steel? Percy being a worker in the field of Metallurgy
      make me specially glad to hear about this.) Then, I need not tell you how deep an
      interest I feel in American politics &amp; want to know if you are satisfied with
      the result of the Cincinnati Convention &amp; what of Mr. Greely? &amp; what you
      augur as to his success—I am sure dear friend if  you realized the joy it is to me to
      receive a few words from you—about anything that is passing in your thoughts
      &amp; around—how beaming bright &amp; happy the day a letter comes &amp; many
      days after—how light hearted &amp; alert I set about my daily tasks, it would
      not seem irksome to you to write. And if you say, "Read my books, &amp; be
      content—you have me in them"—I say, it is because I read them so that I
      am not content. It is an effort to me to turn to any other reading; as to highest
      literature what I felt three years ago is more than  ever true now, with all their precious
      augmentations—I want nothing else—am fully fed &amp; satisfied there. I
      sit alone many hours busy with my needle; this used to be tedious; but it is not so
      now—for always close at hand lie the books that are so dear so dear I brooding
      over the poems sunning myself in them, pondering the Vistas—all the experience
      of my past life &amp; all its aspirations corroborating them—all my future
      &amp; so far as in me lies the future of my children to be shaped modified vitalized
      by &amp; through these—outwardly &amp; inwardly. How can I be content to live
      wholly isolated from you? I  am sure it is not possible for any one,—man or woman, it
      does not matter which, to receive these books, not merely with the intellect
      critically admiring their power &amp; beauty, but with an understanding responsive
      heart, without feeling it drawn out of their breasts so that they must leave all
      &amp; come to be with you sometimes—without a resistless yearning for personal
      intercourse that will take no denial. When we come to America, I shall not want you
      to talk to me; shall not be any way importunate. [
      <span class="unclear">To</span>]
       settle down where there are some
      that love you &amp; understand your poems, somewhere  that you would be sure to come pretty
      often—to have you sit with me while I worked, you silent, or reading to your
      self, I don't mind how: to let my children grow fond of you—to take food with
      us; if my music pleased you, to let me play &amp; sing to you of an evening; Do your
      needlework for [
      <span class="unclear">you—talk</span>]
       freely of all that occupied my thoughts concerning
      the childrens welfare &amp;c—I could be very happy so. But silence with the
      living presence 
      silence with all the [
      <span class="unclear">Ocean?</span>]
       in between are two different things. Therefore, these years
      stretch out your hand cordially trustfully that I may feel its warm [
      <span class="unclear">grasp?</span>]
      .

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
