      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter came &amp; I ought to have written to you before, but one thing &amp;
      another prevented. I was up to Germantown, to a friend's, where I have been a good
      deal lately,—Spent the Christmas &amp; New Year holidays there<sup><a href="#loc.03998_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—they came for me, so I went &amp; was glad—a
      big house full of people, old &amp; young folks, &amp; plenty of fun &amp; every
      thing good—lots of oysters—&amp; 
      cook'd
      
       so nice—I never knew how much there is in the cooking—Otherways I have been here
      in 
      C.
      
       all the time, have done a little work writing, but nothing much,—My
      brother from St Louis has been on here with us for a while—&amp; I have callers
      &amp; visitors quite often—
   </p>
   
   <p>Ruth I got your letter—it was very acceptable—I will answer it
      before long<sup><a href="#loc.03998_n5" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>How are you all? I hope this will find you all well—little George<sup><a href="#loc.03998_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> is all right again I trust by this time—I met two
      jolly &amp; good-looking Jersey boys this afternoon over in Market Street,
      Phila.—it was Elmer and Ed Stafford<sup><a href="#loc.03998_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—we had a
      little talk—did me good to meet them—I dont think Jersey has two nicer
      looking boys—I was on my way to West Philadelphia to see about a Mr Anders, an
      elderly man sick with consumption. <u>Young</u> Mr Anders and I had
      got acquainted in Canada two years ago, &amp; quite attached to each other—he
      was a soldier there—I got a letter from him from Montreal day before
      yesterday, asking me to go to a certain number in West Phila: &amp; see his father,
      who had come on here some time ago quite sick—Young A. wanted me to see &amp;
      write to him how the father was particular—So I went up to-day—when I
      got there I found the elder A. was <u>dead &amp; buried</u>—so
      I have just had to write the sad intelligence to my Canada friend<sup><a href="#loc.03998_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup>—love to you &amp; all

   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have written a few
      lines to Harry
   </p>
   
   <p>I want to come down soon—Is the coast clear?</p>
