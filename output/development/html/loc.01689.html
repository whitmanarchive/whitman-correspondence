      <br></br><br></br>Dear William O'Connor:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As you were interested in Mr. Parton's money-borrowing
      item about me, I enclose you the receipts signed &amp; given me by his Attorney at
      the time, (June, 1857.)<sup><a href="#loc.01689_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> The sum borrowed by me of Mr. Parton was Two hundred
      dollars. He had, just before, kindly volunteered the loan himself, without the least
      request or hint from me. I then declined, but afterward borrowed the money, &amp;
      gave a short-time Note. I felt soon, &amp; feel now, that it was a great impropriety
      on my part, &amp; it has caused me much compunction &amp; real unhappiness since.
      Any how when the time for paying the note came, I had no money. Mr. Parton then put
      the matter in the hands of his Attorney, Mr. Oliver Dyer, who sued. My recollection
      is that I confessed judgment, &amp; proposed to Mr. Dyer that he should receive
      payment in goods. He came by appointment to my room in Classon avenue, Brooklyn,
      June 17, 1857, talked over the matter, behaved very kindly, positively accepted
      there &amp; then, &amp; conveyed away, goods to the amount of One hundred and eighty
      one dollars, and receipted for them, on account. He also, for the balance,
      conditionally accepted other goods, (which he also conveyed away with him,) on the
      agreement between us that if they, when more deliberately examined, proved
      acceptable, they would requite the balance, &amp; the debt would be considered paid;
      otherwise they would be returned, &amp; the balance would still stand against me.
      These goods he retained, and subsequently told me that they had proved acceptable,
      and consented to give me a receipt in full, &amp; satisfaction paper—but, (I
      think,) said the latter would require the signature of Mr. Parton. This was a
      meeting either in the street, or on the Brooklyn ferry. On meeting him afterwards
      in
      a similar way, once or twice, I mentioned the matter of a receipt in full, but never
      pressed it—never procured such receipt, nor the original note either.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I consider the debt <em>paid</em>—(though if I had wealth,
      to-day, I should certainly pay it over again, in cash.) Among the goods rendered I
      remember an oil painting, an original, of marked beauty &amp; value, by Jesse
      Talbot,<sup><a href="#loc.01689_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> illustrating a scene
      from Pilgrim's Progress, worth from four to five hundred dollars. This I put, if I
      remember right, at one hundred dollars. I presume Mr. Dyer or Mr. Parton has it yet.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The enclosed receipt, marked 1,<sup><a href="#loc.01689_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> was, on turning over the goods,
      written by me &amp; signed, by Mr. Dyer, who then remarked that he would also give
      me one in more technical form, and wrote, signed, &amp; handed me the receipt marked
      2<sup><a href="#loc.01689_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I presume, (but do not know for
      certain,) that Mr. Dyer considers the debt fully paid.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>(The balance of thirty five dollars mentioned, besides the one hundred &amp; eighty
      one includes sixteen dollars as Mr. Dyer's fee, or more probably costs of suit, over
      &amp; above the original two hundred.) 
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01689_n1">1. This letter is endorsed
      (by O'Connor), "Parton Matter." Its envelope bears the address, "Wm. D.
      O'Connor, | Light House Board, | Treasury Dep't. | Washington City." Its
      postmark is indecipherable.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01689_n2">2. The "Parton affair" has
      never been adequately explained. This letter, with the accompanying documents
      (reproduced in Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.49.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996],
      3:237–239), was Walt Whitman's version, written at the insistence of
      O'Connor when the story "was bandied about Washington—got into the papers"
      (3:235). Involved according to Whitman were the "venom, jealousies,
      opacities…[of] a woman" (3:235–236), probably Parton's wife, the
      poet Fanny Fern; yet she was the first woman to praise Whitman publicly (<em>New York Dissected</em>, 146–154, 162–165). James
      Parton (1822–1891) was a journalist and, according to the <em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>, "the most successful
      biographer of his generation." Shortly before Whitman had borrowed money, Parton
      had published his first best seller, <em>The Life of Horace
         Greeley</em> (1855). See Oral S. Coad, "Whitman vs. Parton," <em>Journal of the Rutgers University Library</em>, 4 (December
      1940), 1–8; Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em>
      (New York: Macmillan Co., 1955), 209–210; Frank Luther Mott, <em>A History of American Magazines</em> (Cambridge: Harvard
      University Press, 1957), 2:352–353.<a href="#r2">[back]
