      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I mailed you a letter to-day (also one from Mother) containing $5 from Mr Lane.<sup><a href="#loc.00421_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I write to-night mostly to speak about Andrew. He called at the office this afternoon
      and I went around with him to see the Dr that he has been doctoring with, a Dr Hull.<sup><a href="#loc.00421_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> The Dr went through the usual forms and then went on to tell what ailed him ending
      with giving him a lot of medicines and telling him if that did not <em>cure</em> him to call again in a day or two. From the moment my eye rested on the Dr I made
      up my mind that he was a fool, a regular Doctor. I dont think that Andrew will get any good from him
   </p>
   
   <p>I had previously made an appointment with Dr Ruggles<sup><a href="#loc.00421_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> at our office at 4 o'clk, when we returned the Dr was at the office. He talked a
      long time with Andrew. He told him that it would be perfectly easy to give him a bushel
      of medicines but that he could think of no medicine that would be likely to do him
      any good. That he might use alum on his throat but that what would cure him would
      be to take heart, go in the country again, and to resolve to get well that there was
      no medicine would do him so much good as a cheerful mind. The Dr thinks that what
      made him so much worse while away was that he went just as we had a very decided change
      of weather and that he somehow took cold. I had a long talk with Dr Ruggles this eve, and he tells me that he thinks that
      the only thing that will permanently help or cure Andrew is for him to go up in the
      North west and live either by working a little at his trade or something like it.
      I asked mother to-day to let him have one of her rooms upstairs for him to sleep in
      and I intended to see if he could not be nursed up and fed. Mattie has, I think very
      kindly, volunteered to cook and take care of him, and I feel that he could, in a short
      time, be fixed up so that he could carry out the Dr's idea. But Mother, says that
      she cant let him have the room, because it will bring his whole family here.<sup><a href="#loc.00421_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> I tell her to send the whole family back again, but she said, that "she cant let
      him have it and that's the end of it." I think that that she devil the Brown woman<sup><a href="#loc.00421_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> has a great influence over Mother, for she is nothing like she was a few months ago
      about such things. Perhaps it would not do any good but I <em>think</em> it would save his life &nbsp;Another thing, Jess is failing very rapidly indeed,<sup><a href="#loc.00421_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> he is a mere shadow of what he ought to be and I have not the least doubt in my own
      mind that it all comes of his not having anything to eat that he can eat. Somehow
      or another Mother seems to think that she ought to live without spending any money.<sup><a href="#loc.00421_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> Even to day she has 25 or $30 in the house and I will bet that all they have for
      dinner will be a quart of tomats and a few cucumbers, and then Mother wonders why Jess vomits up his meals &nbsp;However
      Mother gets them just as good or better than she has herself<sup><a href="#loc.00421_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

      incorrectly says that Setember 5 is a Wednesday; actually the fifth was a
      Saturday. One might assume, then, that both letters were written on Wednesday,
      September 2, if it were not for Walt Whitman's comment that he received letters
      from Jeff dated the third (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:143). Perhaps both letters were written on Thursday, September 3, 1863.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00421_n8">8. In her letter of
      September 10 (?), 1863, after noting that Andrew's health was "very bad," Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman complained because Andrew wanted some roast lamb: "i said get
      a small peice and have it cooked &nbsp;i told him to have whatever he wanted but to
      be saving of what he had but to get anything he could eat but Walt it is no use
      to talk &nbsp;they just get the very most expensive things &nbsp;lamb is twenty cents per
      lb" (Trent). Perhaps one of the reasons for Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's extreme
      frugality was her need to keep money aside in case one of the Whitman family
      members needed to travel to Burlington, Vermont, to rescue Hannah from her
      husband (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer: A Critical
         Biography of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955; rev. ed., New
