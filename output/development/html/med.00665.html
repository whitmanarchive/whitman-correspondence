   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00052_n1">1. Walt Whitman's increasing
      dissatisfaction with life in George's home (see Walt Whitman's letter to
      Mannahatta and Jessie Louisa Whitman on ) is apparent in the frequency of his absences. He was with the
      Staffords from January 6 to 10 and January 18 to 23 (Commonplace Book, Charles
      E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.), and he stayed with the Gilchrists from January
      10 to 16 and January 25 to February 2.<a href="#r1">[back]
