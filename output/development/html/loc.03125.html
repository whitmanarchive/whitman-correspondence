      bk &amp; chap. on W.W. Yes it is very gloomy weather. I am "swain by winter pinched
      &amp; worn"<sup><a href="#loc.03125_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> somewhat myself, toothache &amp;c. Had a
      stunning dinner, though today (at great upstairs Quincy market restaurant) (chicken
      soup &amp; rump steak &amp; corn bread.) Yr frequent mention of oysters has led me
      to think of them, &amp; we have 'em after. I stick a can full in ulster packet,
      &amp; merrily home I glide. Good letter fr. mother today (in Oberlind). Well the
      richest blessings of time &amp; eternity to you in a glass of orange wine (good,
      too). Love unlimited fr. yr constant lover &amp; friend.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
