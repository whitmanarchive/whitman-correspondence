   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Harlan
      (1820â€“1899), secretary of the interior from 1865 to 1866, dismissed
      Whitman from his second-class clerkship on . Harlan apparently took offense at the copy of the 1860 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> which Whitman was revising and which he
      kept at his desk. With the help of William Douglas O'Connor and Assistant
      Attorney General J. Hubley Aston, Whitman secured a position in the attorney
      general's office. The Harlan episode led directly to O'Connor's pamphlet "The
      Good Gray Poet." Although Harlan was a Methodist, he was not a parson. Whitman
      may have sarcastically applied this term to Harlan because on May 30, 1865,
      Harlan had issued an official directive asking for the names of employees who
      disregarded "in their conduct, habits, and associations the rules of decorum
      &amp; propriety prescribed by a Christian Civilization" (Jerome Loving, <em>Walt Whitman's Champion</em> [College Station: Texas A&amp;M
      University Press, 1978], 57).
