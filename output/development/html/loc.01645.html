   <p>—I have just had my dinner—roast beef, lima beans, graham-bread &amp; sweet butter, 
      with a cup of tea, &amp; some stewed cranberries—eat quite a good dinner, &amp; enjoyed it
      all. 
      I still consider myself getting along very well. O if <u>this</u> only holds out, &amp; keeps on favorably, 
      even if ever so moderate &amp; slow—But I seem to have so many of these gleams that delude
      me 
      into thinking I am on the way to recovery, but soon cloud over again, &amp; let me back
      as bad as ever—But every time I feel pretty easy, I still keep thinking, <u>now</u> 
      I am <u>certainly</u> going to get much better <u>this time</u>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete your short letter came to-day, written on the cars—dear son, come whenever you
      can—As I said on my postal card, if you were here this week, you would find me more
      like myself, 
      (with the exception of walking) than I have been for fourteen months—whether it will
      continue 
      or not, God only knows—but we will hope for the best. As I sit here writing to you
      to day, 
      it appears to me every way hopeful, &amp; likely that we shall yet have good times. 
      Every thing is quiet—rather lonesome. My little dog is stretched out on the rug 
      at full length, snoozing. He hardly lets me go a step without being close at my heels—follows
      me in my slow walks, &amp; stops or turns just as I do. We have had a most windy blustering
      
      March, but it is pleasanter &amp; milder yesterday &amp; to-day—(I saw the new moon over my
      right 
      shoulder a week ago,—<u>of course</u> a <u>sure</u> sign 
      of good luck)—Will finish the letter &amp; send it to-morrow.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p> <u>Friday—March 27—noon</u>.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pleasant &amp; bright weather—have been out on the side walk in front, once or twice,
      
      with my shawl around me—walk slow &amp; quite feeble—have some spells of bad head-ache—Went
      by the West Philadelphia depot yesterday afternoon, in the Market st. horse-cars—saw
      plenty of RR men &amp; conductors, about the place, lounging &amp; waiting their time—thought
      if I could only see <u>you</u> among them—As I sit here writing I can see the trains 
      of the Camden &amp; Amboy, in full view, some 40 or 50 rods off—makes it quite lively—As
      I write I am feeling pretty comfortable, &amp; am going out awhile after I finish this—but
      had a bad night last night. Hope this will find you all right—good bye for this time,
      dear son.

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
