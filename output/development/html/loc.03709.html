   </p>
   
   <p>I received your noble volume of Works,<sup><a href="#n4195" id="r3">3</a></sup> just in time to make it a Christmas present
      from you,—and none could have been more highly valued. I hope it may not be
      the final Edition but that you may live to add more prose and verse to the monument
      which will preserve your name in the Future, for which you write, and to which you
      truly belong. But in the Present and the Past also you have done your work, and thus have gained
      a claim on the Future, which will not be denied you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I cherish two copies of the first edition of your Leaves of Grass—one given me
      by Emerson<sup><a href="#n1044" id="r4">4</a></sup> in the year it was published, and one left to me by
      Sophia Thoreau—her brother Henry's<sup><a href="#hun.00052_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> copy. I shall
      place these and your full-grown volume together, and hand them down to my
      children
   </p>
   
   <p>I enclose the report of an essay I lately read in New York. The ommitted passage is one about
      Emerson which did not properly belong there, and was not read by me,— but the
      reporter found it among the sheets which I handed him to <u>use</u>, not to print entire.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Franklin B. Sanborn
      (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
      he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
      the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
      reviewed <em>Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Boston
         Commonwealth</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00059.html">February 24, 1866</a>. He was editor of the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
      his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
      appeared without Sanborn's name in the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K. Walker,
