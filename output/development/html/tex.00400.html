      <br></br><br></br>Mr. Whitman,
      <br></br>Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>It was with exceeding interest that Mr Curtis &amp; I<sup><a href="#tex.00400_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup> listened to the letter you lately wrote to Dr. Russell,<sup><a href="#loc.00852_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> which came to us through my sister Miss Stevenson.
   </p>
   
   <p>Its effect was to make us desire to aid you in the good work you are engaged in,—caring
      for the sick &amp; wounded soldiers.  We inclose thirty dollars, &amp; feel very glad to have
      the opportunity to minister to their comfort.  Mr Curtis would send it anonymously,
      but I think it is pleasant to know where one has excited an interest, &amp; in asking
      you to acknowledge its receipt, my wish is, most to be sure that it has reached its
      destination.
   </p>
   
   <p>My direction is to care of Charles P. Curtis, Boston.</p>

      With regard, I am,
