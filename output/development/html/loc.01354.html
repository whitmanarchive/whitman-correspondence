      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman—  
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Thy card of the 4th greeted us on our return home from Wales last night.<sup><a href="#loc.01354_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> How I wish that it contained <u>really
         good</u> news, it is dreadful for thee to have to keep thy room so long! 
   </p>
   
   <p> I am sending thee Mr. Summers'<sup><a href="#n4299" id="r2">2</a></sup> account of his delightful visit to thee. I am so
      grateful to thee for seeing him—I suppose it was my letter he presented? He is
      a curious man, with first rate  political ability, but extraordinarily lazy. He has been a very
      intimate friend of my husband's since their College days, but I do not know him very
      well. I often see him hovering on the outskirts of a crowd at large parties, but he
      seems too lazy to talk to anybody. If he were more energetic he could rise to be one
      of the Liberal Leaders, but he has been cursed with a comfortable income, &amp; has
      never been <u>forced</u> to work. The parable of the Camel &amp; the
      Needle's Eye is not confined to the Kingdom of Heaven. 
   </p> 
   
   <p> We have returned to a sea of work. Frank &amp; Sam both  going as delegates to the great
      Liberal Convention at Birmingham—where we are to read modest papers on
      political subjects. The great event will be Mr. Gladstone's<sup><a href="#loc.01354_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> speech—wh. is to be <u>phonographed</u>!
   </p>
   
   <p>We have all had a delightful summer together in Wales. Father's health is quite
      restored, &amp;, in spite of the loss of one eye, he is able to read &amp; drive
      &amp; follow his usual course of life. Little Ray<sup><a href="#loc.01354_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> gets
      more enchanting every day. She can say over 50 words by this time, &amp; she is 
      beginning to take an interest in dolls. She has a perfect temper &amp; robust
      health.
   </p>
   
   <p>Please thank Mr. Gilchrist,<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r5">5</a></sup> if  thee sees him soon, for the paper
      he sent me. I am glad he succeeded in getting the appointment, &amp; I think the 
      Phila.
      
       Academy is to be congratulated. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I shall await with the greatest interest the copy of "November Boughs." Will it be
      on sale at all in England? 
   </p>
   
   <p> I have an accumulation of 20 letters to write today—so I must make my first
      one short. 
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With love,
      <br></br>thy friend,
      <br></br>Mary Costelloe.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> P.S. Father &amp; Alys<sup><a href="#loc.04268_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; two of her friends start on a driving trip from Wales
      to London tomorrow. Logan is at Oxford.
