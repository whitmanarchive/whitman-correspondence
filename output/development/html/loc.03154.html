      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I give to my good friend Horace Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r1">1</a></sup> the Sarrazin<sup><a href="#n3115" id="r2">2</a></sup> book which I have had so much pleasure in translating from; and
      I want to excuse myself for keeping it overlong with the plan that I mainly retained
      it for use in case you desired me to read proof.
   </p>
   
   <p>This gives me a chance to say a rousing Thank you! for your gift of <u>Leaves of Grass</u> and for your kindness in sending the
      letter of Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      [
      <span class="unclear">anent?</span>]
       the <u>American</u> articles—all of which 
      Traubel has probably
      conveyed to you my gratitude for, long ago.
   </p>
   
   <p>The unique copy of L of G. is better
      than much wealth.
   </p>

      Yours faithfully

      moderns de l'amérique, Walt Whitman," <em>La Nouvelle Revue</em>, 52 (May 1888), 164–84; Morris's
      translation of Sarrazin's piece is reprinted in <em>In Re Walt Whitman</em> (1893, pp. 159–194).

      Arts and editor of <em>Lippincott's Magazine</em>, as

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4267">1. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3115">2. Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935)
      was a translator and poet from France, who commented positively not only on
      Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and
      apparently liked the critic's work on <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>—Whitman even had Sarrazin's chapter on his book translated
      twice. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
