      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well here I am still, pretty much the same thing, doing nothing &amp; taking things easy.
      By your letter I see that you too are jogging along about the same, on your car, with
      an
      occasional let up—Often in my jaunts around the city, or on the bay, I wish you were
      with me, as you would enjoy it much—I have seen Mr. Hart,<sup><a href="#loc.01538_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      formerly of the Chronicle—he is about the same in appearance as formerly—Pete, I
      will not write much this time, as I am feeling somewhat dull and stupid this
      forenoon—We had a fine shower last night, and there is some breeze—but it is
      pretty warm and oppressive—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, here is a loving kiss for you, dear son, and much, much love for you, as ever,
      from
      your affectionate comrade &amp; father—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
