   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00609_n5">1. This letter dates to
      February 9, 1871. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter February 9, and
      Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1871. However, Edwin Haviland Miller
      dated a letter, presumably this one, February 8, 1871 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:368). The month and year are certain because the letter refers
      to the "hudson river horror," which matches a train disaster that occurred on
      February 7, 1871. No other letter can date to February 9, 1871, so Miller's date
      February 8 is an error.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00609_n1">2. Walt Whitman's February
      7?, 1871 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant. Miller dated
      Walt's missing letter February 6?, 1871 (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:362).<br><br>
      <em>The Graphic: An Illustrated Weekly Newspaper</em>, founded
      by William Luson Thomas (1830–1900), began publication in London in
      December 1869. Its high-quality illustrations and coverage of the
      Franco-Prussian War helped its circulation to rise rapidly, to around 50,000
      subscribers by 1870 and up to 250,000 subscribers by 1874. See Laurel Brake
      and Marysa Demoor, ed., <em>Dictionary of Nineteenth-Century
         Journalism</em> (London: British Library, 2009). The steam crossing from
      Liverpool to New York took about 12 days in 1870, so Walt presumably
      forwarded a copy of <em>The Graphic</em> that dated to early
      or mid-January. The January 18 number has a full-page engraving of a dying
      French soldier in another's arms, Henry Woods's "The Last Message," which is
      paired with a poem of the same title by Walter Thornbury (36, 35). The
      January 7 number has a two-page engraving by Godefroy Durand with ten
      foreground figures of dying or deceased soldiers entitled "The Last Bivouac:
      The Crest of a Hill Between Champigny and Villiers, on the Night of December
      5, 1870," which is also paired with a poem entitled "The Last Bivouac" by E.
      J. C. (10–11, 9).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00609_n4">3. On February 7, the Second
      Pacific Express, a passenger train, collided with a derailed freight train
      carrying an estimated 500 barrels of kerosene. The ensuing conflagration
      resulted in significant loss of life. See "Appalling Disaster: A Human Holocaust
      on the Hudson River Railroad. Passengers Roasted Alive. Forty or Fifty Persons
      Supposed to Have Perished," <em>New York Times</em>, February 8,
      1871, 1.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00609_n2">4. Walt Whitman cut his thumb
      in late April or early May 1870, and it became infected. He referred to the
      injury in two letters from Brooklyn, a  letter to Walbridge A. Field and a second  letter to William D. O'Connor. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      inquired about or expressed concern for his thumb in this and five other letters
      to Walt from May or June to July 1870: , , , , , and .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n3">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00609_n6">6. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters,
      Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St.
      Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie suffered long with a throat ailment
      that led to her death in 1873. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron,
      ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em>
      (New York: New York University Press, 1977), 1–26.<br><br>
      The date that Mattie and her daughters arrived in spring 1871 is not known,
      but the visit was probably planned to coincide with the marriage of George
      Washington Whitman to Louisa Orr Haslam in March or April 1871.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00550_n4">7. Charles L. Heyde
      (1822–1892) a landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman
      (1823–190), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's second daughter, and they lived in
      Burlington, Vermont.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00559_n12">8. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., resided in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles L.
      Heyde.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00609_n13">9. Charles Heyde was infamous
      among the Whitmans for his offensive letters. Louisa wrote, in her  letter to Walt Whitman, "i had a
      letter or package from charley hay three sheets of foolscap paper and a fool
      wrote on them."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">10. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r10">[back]
