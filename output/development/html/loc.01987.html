      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>your letter of the 10<u>th</u> of
      January was received more than a week ago and should have
      been answered before this time but I have not been in the humor of writing and have
      kept putting it off till some more convenient season but I will try to be more
      punctual in the future.
   </p>
   
   <p>Father is staying with me again and he borrowed "Leaves of Grass,"
      for me of Dr. Hawley for a few days and was very much
      interested in it, but I  will be candid with you. I think on the start I was more
      interested in it because it was your work than for the good sentiments it contained,
      but as I got more acquainted with it I liked it for its own value, although I 
      can not
      
       understand all of it I 
      can not
      
       find anything indecent about it. But my kind Old Friend you must not think
      that because I wrote to you and mentioned it, that I wish you to send me the Book
      for that is not what I intended for you to think.
   </p>
   
   <p>Drum Taps I have not seen yet nor is it to be found at any of the
      stores in Syracuse. Dr. Hawley has been trying to get a
      copy of it for about a  month but all that was here 
      were
      
       taken as soon as they arrived.
   </p>
   
   <p>We have splended sleighing here now, and have had for about, two or three weeks or
      more.
   </p>
   
   <p>You say you wish me to write how I am situated what I am doing &amp;c. I wrote to you
      a year and more ago that I was married but did not receive any reply so I did not
      know but you 
      was
      
       displeased with it.
   </p>
   
   <p>I was married to a New York Lady, Daughter of the late P.L.
      Gage of the firm of Gage, Sloans &amp; Dater
      No 83
      Chamber St and 65 
      Reed
      
       St but like many others they went down in the crisis of 1857
       I went into
      Business with a partner at manufacturing Parlor Brackets a little over a year ago
      and continued it about six or Seven months and lost about one thousand dollars and
      found myself in debt six hundred dollars and finally came to the conclusion that it
      was time I closed up my business, so I did so about the first of July
      last, and am now at work at my trade in a Piano Forte &amp;
      Melodeon Manufactory and find that it pays me better than business
      on my own book. Now I think I have given you a good statement of my situation and
      hope it will be to your satisfaction
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>If you come to New York next summer on a visit I shall
      expect you to take a short trip up here to see me (if I am here) and I will pay your
      fare and take as good care of you as we possibly can. Now if you come to New York, you must not fail to let me know it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Hamilton has returned from the west. his Brother is gaining slowly,
      he sends his love to you and says he will write to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Father is living with me now, he says he wrote to you a few days
      ago
   </p>
   
   <p>My Wife wants me to send her love to you for she says she loves 
      any body
      
       that I love [
      <span class="unclear"> I devote some of my leisure to reading
         and writing but I have not had any History except what we have got in the house
         because I have not had access to the Libraries, but if you will write what
         history I shall get, I will get a library ticket and try to get them. History is
         my favorite reading. I do not know as this letter will be very interesting to
         you so I will close for this time hoping to hear from you again
         soon.</span>]

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The friendship of Walt Whitman
      with this former soldier can be reconstructed from Benton H. Wilson's
      letters in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection. On , Wilson recalled his confinement in Armory Square
      Hospital (as mentioned in Whitman's , letter to Lewis K. Brown), "when your kind face
      &amp; pleasant words cheered the soldier Boys &amp; won their hearts. I
      never shall forget the first time you came in after David &amp; I got there.
      We Loved you from the first time we spoke to you." In Wilson's first letter,
      written on , he began: "I
      suppose you will think that I have forgotten you long before this time but I
      have not, your kindness to me while in the hospital will never be forgotten
      by me." After a lapse in the correspondence, he wrote on : "I wish if aggreable to
      yourself to keep up a regular correspondence between us ... I think it will
      be of benefit to me morally, and perhaps will not be of any detriment to
      you." In this letter he admitted that he had just discovered that Walt
      Whitman was a poet. On , he
      informed Walt Whitman that he had been reading <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>, but complained: "I wrote to you a year and more ago that I
      was married but did not receive any reply, so I did not know but you was
      displeased with it"; he concluded the letter: "I remain as ever yourBoy
      Friendwith LoveBenton H. Wilson." Walt Whitman replied (lost), and
      sent <em>The Good Gray Poet</em>, which Wilson acknowledged on
      . On , after he informed Walt Whitman
      that his wife had gone to the hospital for her first confinement (the child
      was to be named Walt Whitman), Wilson complained: "I am poor and am proud of
      it but I hope to rise by honesty and industry. I am a married man but I am
      not happy for my disposition is not right. I have got a good Woman and I
      love her dearly but I seem to lack patience or something. I think I had
      ought to live alone, but I had not ought to feel so." On , Wilson acknowledged Walt
      Whitman's reply of : "I do not
      want you to misunderstand my motives in writing to you of my Situation &amp;
      feelings as I did in my last letter or else I shall have to be more guarded
      in my letters to you. I wrote so because you wanted me to write how I was
      situated, and give you my mind without reserve, and all that I want is your
      advice and Love, and I do not consider it cold lecture or dry advice. I wish
      you to write to me just as you feel &amp; express yourself and advise as
      freely as you wish and will be satisfied." On , Wilson wondered why Walt Whitman had not
      replied.<br><br>
      In his letter of , Wilson
      reported that he had moved to Greene, N. Y., but was still selling melodeons
      and sewing machines (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). On , Wilson informed Walt Whitman of
      his father's death two weeks earlier and related that his son "Little Walt
      ... is quite a boy now ... and gets into all kinds of Mischief." Benton's
      father, who "was insane at times," had written to Walt Whitman on , and on  (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection). Evidently Wilson wrote to Walt Whitman for the last time on
      June 23, 1875, when he wanted to know "what I can do to contribute to your
      comfort and happiness" (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York
      Public Library).
