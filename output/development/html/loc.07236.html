   <p>How do the fates serve you these last few lovely days? Well I hope. We are all well
      here and the meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> goes on quietly and well as far as we know. Nothing fresh
      however. The autumn weather here is just perfect, sunshiny, hazy, dreamy. Puts me
      in
      mind all the time of Tennyson's<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r3">3</a></sup> "Lotos Eaters."<sup><a href="#loc.07236_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> How goes the
      book—I hope to get a perfect autograph copy both of N.B.<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; C.W.<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r6">6</a></sup> 
      from you before a very great while—I shall look upon them as the crown and summit
      of all
      my W.W. Collection—a collection by the way which gives me a lot  of worry sometimes to
      think what I am eventually to do with it. I regard it as so precious that no
      ordinary disposition of it will do—I am sorry to hear that Kennedy's<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r7">7</a></sup> book is not to be out at present—I fear it is quite a
      disappointment to him.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am going to write an elaborate annual report this year mostly on "alcohol" am in
      the middle of it—expect to give the alcohol men a "black eye"

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07236_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: LONDON | AM | SP 10 | 88 | CANADA. There is an additional Camden
      postmark from September, but it is illegible.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07230_n2">2. Bucke and his brother-in-law
      William John Gurd were designing a gas and fluid meter to be patented in Canada
      and sold in England.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0625">3. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07236_n2">4. "The Lotos-Eaters" is a poem
      by Tennyson about Odysseus and his mariners eating lotos leaves and entering an
      altered state of consciousness; it was published in 1832.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">5. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">6. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">7. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
