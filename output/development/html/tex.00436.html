   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00436_n1">1. Whitman crossed this letter
      out and composed a draft letter on the back. See the draft letter from Whitman
      to Alfred Lord Tennyson of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3004">2. Benjamin Gurney (1833–1899)
      was the son of Jeremiah Gurney (1812–1886), one of the founding figures of
      American photography. Together, they ran the Gurney &amp; Son photographic
      studio in New York and took several pictures of Whitman in the early 1870s (see
      John Rietz, "Another Whitman Photograph: The Gurney and Rockwood Sessions
      Reconsidered," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 9 [Summer
      1991] 24–25). After the end of the firm in 1874 and with Jeremiah in
      Europe, Benjamin Gurney seemed to have started working for his former
      competitor, Napoleon Sarony. For more on Gurney &amp; Son, see Christian A.
      Peterson, <em>Chaining the Sun: Portraits by Jeremiah Gurney</em>
      (Minneapolis: Minneapolis Institute of Arts, 2000).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3003">3. Napoleon Sarony (1821–1896)
      was an eccentric lithographer and photographer who took at least nine pictures
      of the grey-bearded Whitman in 1878. Besides Whitman, Sarony's clients included
      well-known literary figures like Mark Twain and Oscar Wilde. One of the
      trailblazers of modern celebrity culture, Sarony invited public figures to sit
      for him and be included in his catalogues. Whitman enjoyed the experience,
      writing Harry Stafford that he "had a real pleasant time" and calling the studio
      a "great photographic establishment" (see his letter to Stafford of ). For more on Sarony, see Ed
      Folsom, "Nineteenth-century Visual Culture," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 284.<a href="#r3">[back]
