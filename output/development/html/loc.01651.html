      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I still remain about the same, &amp; with nothing to write about in the way of my
      improvement, or any thing else—but I thought you would want to have a word.
      Your letter of last Sunday came all right. The paper has also come. I am no
      worse—&amp; continue to live on <u>hope</u>—fortunately I  have
      been stocked with a good plentiful share of it. It is pleasant weather here, though
      hot—we have frequent rains—We have had one to-day, about an hour ago,
      but now it is very bright and pleasant—I am going to try to get out a little—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So good bye for this time, dear son—I hope to write more of a letter next time. </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
