      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I thank you for your thoughtfulness in [
      <span class="unclear">rendering?</span>]
      
      me the Atlantic with your glorious poem which has caught up the grandeur &amp;
      harmony of the Cretian itself.

   <p>I hope you will take the Crusades in hand in reference to Crete &amp; the contest
      betwixt Christian &amp; [
      <span class="unclear">Mussalman?</span>]
      
      .
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A grand subject worthy of true genius! A gathering of natures as shining &amp; wild
      as that now tossing about in these States, all bent on driving the Turks &amp;
      Saracens from Christian land. Popes, Kings, Emperors, he of France the sainte Louis
      IX &amp; the English monarch Richard Coeur de Lion, [
      <span class="unclear">Martinus?</span>]
      
      [
      <span class="unclear">Aussens?</span>]
       &amp; [
      <span class="unclear">princesses?</span>]
      , the flower of
      the nobility, all armed to the teeth, armor-clad with no thought but hatred to the
      Turk &amp; love for Christ &amp; for Womanhood, which the Turk defiles. [
      <span class="unclear">Immense?</span>]
      
      [
      <span class="unclear">Caravanserais?</span>]
      
      [
      <span class="unclear">slacking?</span>]
       from all lands,
      for several centuries, [illegible] by rapt men—Peter the
      Hermit, Walter the Pennyless, all classes joining, all
      races, all ages; children's crusades; eighty thousand children <u>En</u>
      <u>route</u> for Holy Land; rabble; loafers; religious &amp;
      otherwise [
      <span class="unclear">join?</span>]
      ;
      thieves; prostitutes; all; high &amp; low, virtuous &amp; vicious, all humanity on
      horseback! But mark 
      but then mere thousands of sailors; the ships of Venice, Genoa &amp; Spain &amp;
      behold the result! While their ships were crossexamining Mediterranean &amp; Aegean
      sea to find the best harbour wherein to lay hand on Turk they became acquainted with
      navigation, <u>with the art of 
         navigatg
         
         </u></p>
   
   
   <p>The spirit of maritime <u>discovery</u> was thus <u>initiated by these crusading fleets,</u> &amp; when this
      spirit had culminated in the discovery of America, then Crusading spirit <u>dies out</u> &amp; trading spirit, venturesome, engendering
      negro-traffic, was ushered <u>into existence</u>.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Hence the poet is right to conclude that the Enterprise which originated in Christian
      Enthusiasm, was killed by the spirit of maritime discovery to which it had given
      birth
   </p>
   
   <p>If the Genoese &amp; Spanish sailors had not been experimenting on the sea in the
      Crusading expeditions, the best of discovery [
      <span class="unclear">would?</span>]
       not have been developed; Columbus would
      not have been incited to his expedition &amp; America would not have been
      discovered.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And then the poetry that was born by the Crusades. Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata, &amp; Goethe's drama, Torquato Tasso with his poetic love of
      Princess Eleonora. And the chivalry, the heroic, martial
      spirit; the martyr; the Christ spirit the millions of Christians slain in the
      attempt to wrest the sepulchre from Turk.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>You see the connection. The discovery of America had the excellent
      
      result of the Crusading expeditions. But the spirit of Enterprise crushed that of
      religious entusiasm &amp; thus it was that the Turk was allowed to remain to oppress
      Crete &amp; Greece &amp; now America repays the debt which it owes to the poor
      Christians of the East whose dream was sealed because America had to be discovered
      &amp; a maelstrom of material Enterprise to be let loose
   </p>
   
   <p>How grandly you might weave all this together in [
      <span class="unclear">words?</span>]
       &amp; mankind-stirring stanzas! Ponder
      over it &amp; if I can make further suggestions, let me know

   <p>Full two hundred years before Columbus came</p>
   
   <p>The way to his advent was clearly traced</p>
   
   <p>By the armadas thronged with Crusaders</p>
   
   <p>Who drove the

       from the land of

      of the sea
   </p>
   
   <p>Until the seamen struck upon these shores</p>

   <p>New centuries have since come &amp; gone</p>
   
   <p>But the old bond between East &amp; West survives</p>
   
   <p>When Arcade fell into thousand Christian martyrs &amp; Men &amp; women gave their

   <p>and all the chivalric, holy trinity of them get revived</p>
   
   <p>To do in mere days &amp; in our quiet way</p>
   
   <p>Which was done of yore in turmoil &amp; confusion</p>
   
   <p>So great is the result of the Genoen's adventure</p>
   
   <p>That our influence transcend all the armies of all the Crusaders</p>
   
   <p>Let us pay the debt we owe to these great souls</p>

   <p>Let our nation give the honour of fellowship to Crete</p>
   
   <p>To Crete delivered from the Turkish yoke</p>
   
   <p>And by a divine law of grandation</p>

   <p>The enterprise that killed medeival capture built up our Continent</p>
   
   <p>Our bounties shall yet atone for a guilt that brought us into being</p>
   
   
   
   <p>The Turk need not complain for he had his spree</p>
   
   <p>And more than this: when he is herded back to Asian wilds</p>
   
   <p>He may then apply what he was [illegible] by

   <p>But he shall no longer rule in Christian lands</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Julius Bing was a social reformer appointed as clerk
      of the Joint Select Committee on Retrenchment in early 1867. Bing wrote more
      than twenty articles on the civil service, which were published in the <em>North American Review</em> and <em>Putnam's
         Magazine</em>. Little is known about Bing, and although this letter suggests
      that Walt Whitman had written to Bing at least once before, no other
      correspondence between the two is currently extant. Although Whitman explored
      (in several unpublished manuscripts) the idea and suggestions Bing made about a
      poem referencing the Crusades and while other manuscripts and published works
      share similarities in topic and idea, a direct link is unknown. See also Art

         Service Reform Movement, 1865–1883</em> (Urbana: University of
      Illinois Press, 1968), 40–49.
