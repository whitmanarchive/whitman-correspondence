   <p>
      </span><span class="handshift">I take pleasure in soliciting your literary
      cooperation in an enterprise which has been conducted with great success since the
      beginning of the year. A number of important American newspapers, among which may
      be
      mentioned such as the New York <u>Tribune</u>, Philadelphia <u>Press</u>, Detroit <u>Post</u>, Chicago <u>Times</u>, St. Paul <u>Pioneer Press</u>
      etc. have agreed to combine in receiving for their Sunday Editions articles
      arranged for and edited by me, to be written by distinguished authors, scientists,
      travellers, and men of affairs  on both sides of the Atlantic. Many eminent contributors in
      Europe and America have already written, and many others have promised to write. The
      papers in which these articles are published reach nearly two millions of the most
      intelligent people of the country. The aim is that these papers should be as far as
      possible of a bright and popular character '(even when treating of serious topics)
      such as would interest the reader of newspapers and magazines; and I sincerely hope
      you will find it consistent with your obligations to give me your literary
      assistance. 
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span> I should like a paper from you at your very earliest
      leisure about 3000 words in length and leave 
      
       the subject
      somewhat to yourself, only asking that it shall be of a popular character. I shall
      be glad to send you an honorarium of $50 for such a paper. Hoping to hear from you
      very soon and that you can give me the article at once,<sup><a href="#syr.00016_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      I remain,
