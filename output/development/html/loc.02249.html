      <br></br><br></br> Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I feel as though I cannot begin the new year without wishing you all possible health
      and happiness. I hope you will appreciate these greetings of a stranger when he
      tells you that to him you are no stranger but an ever present comrade.
   </p>
   
   <p>Besides telling you of the great good you have done me I want to assure you of the
      hearty love you are winning, among the students and teachers here. To me you have
      been—a guiding star—a light in the wilderness. I trace my highest and best
      thoughts 
       and feelings to
      your poems. I wish I could give you some idea of how I feel towards the author of
      "Leaves of Grass."
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you will not think this a bait for an autograph, I am above that – I merely
      want to thank you for the good you have done me.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Your humble admirer &amp; wellwisher,
      <br></br>O. F. Hershey.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Omer Fenimore Hershey
      (1867–?) was the son of Menno Frick and Malinda Reed (Matter) Hershey. He
      was a graduate of Harvard Law School and later practiced for many years as an
      attorney in Baltimore, Maryland. He married Sylvia Rhodora Shaffer in 1892, and
      the couple had two daughters, Helen (1894) and Louise (1895). See "Omer Fenimore
      Hershey ('91)," <em>Record of the Class of 1892. Secretary's
         Report No. V. For the Twentieth Anniversary</em> (Boston: The Fort Hill
      Press, 1912), 206. In 1895, Hershey described himself as "Practising law on a
      little oatmeal . . . Have done nothing to be proud of. Am taking life easy, and
      going in for happiness and contentment. Married life, 'a grand sweet song,' even
      though there aren't three babies" (<em>Harvard College Class of
         1891 Secretary's Report, No. 2</em> [Boston: Alfred Mudge &amp; Son,
      Printers, 1895], 41).
