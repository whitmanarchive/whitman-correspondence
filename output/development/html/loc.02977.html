      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The sad end is come. William<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup> passed peacefully to rest at 2 A.
      M. this day. He failed very much the last week, &amp; more on Sunday, &amp; from that day
      on.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is sad because he so wanted to get well, &amp; to the last thought he was going to recover.</p>
   
   <p>But he lies now the image of perfect rest &amp; peace, &amp; more beautiful than I ever saw
      him, &amp; looks as he did when I knew him first so long ago, &amp; the late loss of flesh
      in the face has brought back the very look of youth.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Will you kindly inform Dr. Bucke?<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> I can not write him yet.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am indeed alone, both children, my father &amp; mother, all four of my brothers are
      gone. What a group to welcome me when I shall join them!
   </p>
   
   <p>Last Sunday was the anniversary of our darling Jeannie's<sup><a href="#n4138" id="r3">3</a></sup> passing
      on, &amp; I almost thought William would go that very day.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n2002">1. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n4138">3. Jean was the daughter of William D.
      and Ellen O'Connor. William speaks often in his letters of Jean, calling her by
      her nicknames of "Jenny" or "Jeannie."<a href="#r3">[back]
