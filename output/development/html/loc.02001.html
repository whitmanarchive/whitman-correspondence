      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You will excuse the liberty of an entire stranger's addressing you which is only
      pardonable under the present circumstances.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I desire to ask your advice to a young man who has selected the field of literature
      as that in which he shall labor as to what are the true principles on which a
      conscientious writer for the present American public should  act. What do you conceive to be the true
      need of the American people as regards literature and in what way should the young
      writer seek to prepare himself for supplying them.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Should he recur to the Past, and seek in the 
      master's
      
       of Antiquity those grand ideas which though used by generations are not
      yet exhausted; should he study history and endeavor to gather from experience what
      the tendency  &amp;
      need of the world is of the present; shall he study the thinkers of the present, the
      Mills', Buckles', Spencers', Tennysons' etc and see what they have gathered as the
      results of past &amp; present experiences or finally shall he abandon books
      altogether and plunging into the vortex of human life, strive by actual contact with
      the people to find what they desire, and how to supply their want
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I know no one who is so competent to advise upon this point  as yourself, and trust you will favor me
      with a reply.—I am yet young but have had more experience for my age than many
      Desiring to thoroughly understand the work I have undertaken I make these
      inquiries—My dearest wish is like Burns'—
