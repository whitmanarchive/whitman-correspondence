   <p>I am sitting here alone in the front room—a cold, gusty, wintry day outside, but

   <p id="n0450">2. For a time Walt Whitman lived with William D. and
      Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to
      be his close associates during the early Washington years. William Douglas
      O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good
      Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In 1872 Whitman
      and William strongly disagreed on the Fifteenth Amendment, which Whitman opposed
      and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended Whitman's opinion, and in response
      William moved out. The correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost
      as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00325_n2">3. Whitman refers here to his nephew, Walter
      Orr Whitman, born November 4, 1875, who died in 1876; Whitman wrote of the birth
      in his  letter to John
      Burroughs.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00325_n3">4. The letter is mutilated for the next
      several lines because someone cut off Whitman's signature.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0700">5. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0710">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890), known as
      "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
      eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
      recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
      marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
      correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
      together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Matty) in 1873 and
      his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
      his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!" For
      more on Thomas Jefferson Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00325_n4">7. Whitman also wrote about Burroughs's visit
      in a  letter to Peter
      Doyle.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00325_n5">8. Whitman had known Hillard's writings since
      1871 and mentioned her in his  letter
      to Charles Eldridge. He sent her a copy of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> on July 27, 1876 (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00325_n6">9. Professor J. Peter Lesley was appointed
      state geologist of University of Pennsylvania in 1874. He was also secretary of
      the American Philosophical Society. Anne Gilchrist spoke glowingly of the
      "delightful family circle" of the Lesleys (Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist, <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em> [London: T. F.
      Unwin, 1887], 228–229). Maggie Lesley, an artist, visited Gilchrist in
      1881 (Thomas B. Harned, ed., <em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and
         Walt Whitman</em> [Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, Page, and Co., 1918],
      198).<a href="#r9">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00325_n8">11. Whitman had submitted this review in his  letter to Whitelaw Reid.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0684">12. The Washington <em>Star</em> was
      established in 1852 by Joseph Borrows Tate. In 1867, Crosby Stuart Noyes, Samuel
      H. Kauffmann and George Adams bought the newspaper, with Noyes serving as editor
      from 1867 until his death in 1908.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00325_n9">13. Moncure D. Conway had arrived in America
      for a lecture tour in September 1875; Whitman wrote of Conway's arrival in his
       letter to William
      Linton.<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00325_n10">14. Whitman refers here to an unidentified
      Washington friend of Ellen O'Connor.<a href="#r14">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00325_n12">16. Nancy M. Johnson is listed in the 1875
      Directory as a widow. Whitman sent a set of books to her, as mentioned in his
       letter to Ellen
      O'Connor.<a href="#r16">[back]
