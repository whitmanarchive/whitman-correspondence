   <p>
      Your kind letter of the 22nd &amp; 23rd July, trebly welcome for its being a surprise,
      has come, and with it, I am gla[illegible],
      Dr Bucke's book<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r1">1</a></sup> (delayed, apparently, by the American P. O. authorities) We had been worrying the
      P.O. here for the previous month. It is 12 p.m. Ada and I have
      been arguing about your indication that the "whole theory of the universe points unerringly"
      to each individual in it, for she lost two lovers: before, we were saying
      goodbye to a member of our little literary circle, a nice young chap, a blacksmith
      thrown out of work here over the strike, and now going to a [illegible]
      Ocean to help build a lighthouse. He will be away many months, and we feel now how
      we have liked him, I can tell you. (We didn't do much "Date of Ethics" tonight, I
      fear) Before
      sea, I met a young Welshman, named Davis, who told me he knew Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#n4152" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; then we talked of you. He says the Welsh like you, can't help liking you. He was
      delighted at your letter and then told me he was on the staff of the "Age" our principal
      people's newspaper &amp; that he would see me again &amp; have a yarn about you.
      I sent several extracts about you to the papers, but somehow can't get them in. I
      fear you are a little "taboo" yet. I send you an Argus of last week with a sample
      of the
      only kind of notice you get in the "feudal" circles. I wish I had something more cheering,
      but as they are constantly referring to you in a similar strain,
      your influence is clearly being felt. Ibsen is similarly treated by this paper. From
      my knowledge of the 'caste' that this paper pleads for, I take its remarks as favourable
      indications. Your complaints re the great journals refusing you a hearing pain all
      who know you but we console ourselves by the knowledge that the "demons of our sires
      are the gods that we adore".

      I read a paper on your attitude towards Democracy "the Gospel of Democracy as promulgated
      by Walt Whitman", before the Australian Church Literary Society on last Tuesday week.
      The 
      reverend chairman was decidedly unsympathetic, but the tone of the debate was altogether
      in your favour. Level-headed, old men, and fiery young ones fought
      like paladins for you, and Walt carried the day. A reverend opponent was disarmed
      by being driven to own that he didn't believe in the brotherhood of man. The refreshing
      power
      with which one young man urged the audeince to read and absorb the Song of the Open
      Road and the vision with which another insisted on your being the "great poet", did
      our hearts
      good &amp; made us wish you had heard them. . I was sorry the head of the church (Dr.
      Strong) was not there, for he really preaches your gospel, although perhaps he would
      not say so.
      I treated your "Democracy" analytically

      With such ammunition and provision in the shape of sundry editions of L of G. we ought
      to be fit to meet all opponents. If I can ever manage to get my hand in at literary
      work,
      I shall make sturdy attempts to do your yoeman service, at any rate. People don't
      take much notice of a poor clerk in an obscure library, I fear. I can only try to
      seek out those
      who can fight effectively. My canvassing for pecuniary powder &amp; shot for you is not
      very successful as yet, partly owing to the canvasser &amp; partly to the strike. The
      
      shearers and rouseabouts are striking now (Ted will be among them) and a commercial
      and industrial deadlock of ominous character is on. You shall get a 'glint' of it
      from the "Argus"
      (a little predjucided perhaps).

   <p>
      I can see your influence in many of our Australian singers. One especially, Francis
      Adams<sup><a href="#loc.03380_n4" id="r9">9</a></sup>, (whom a poet-chum of mine, Sydney Jephcott<sup><a href="#loc.03380_n5" id="r10">10</a></sup>,
      holds greater than Shakespeare) wrote several years ago a great number of love poems
      of sickly sweetness: since then he has published a book called "Songs of the Army
      of the Night",
      simple, terse, sledge-hammer-like in which your influence is very apparent. They call
      him "Whitman &amp; water" jokingly. He is in England now, making towards "fame".
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Mr Bury was "up to the neck" in labour matters, conferences with "dockers" etc. in
      England the last we heard of him. I <u>do</u> hope he will see you.
      You would be regular chums. He has been through so much here in Australia, has absorbed
      our Australian life so much more than anyone I know, and has withal so excellent
      a heart, so eclectic (in the broadest sense) a nature, that he will be a good type
      to you of what our democracy can flower to. His frequent daft quoting of obscure authors
      first
      showed me that respectability's or conventional hallmarks were not essential to great
      merit.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I hope my 'ramblers' don't tire you. With many thanks for your kindness in sending
      the portraits, papers, and Dr. Bucke's "Live" Life (Fred &amp; Jim are at it now, I go
      for a 
      week's holiday to the wildest parts of our "ranges" tomorrow, and will try to get
      a suitable setting for fully enjoying it. W. O'Connor hasn't lost the Celtic blood
      over there,
      it is evident. One feels in an ancestral fair-scrimage while reading.) Fred &amp; Jim
      and That his sister, Ada, Eve, Mr &amp; Mrs Fryer all join in 
      this our love-message, to our benefactor, our comrade and our bard. Blessings on you
      and heartily do we pray that your afflictions may be lightened and all your remaining
      days
      bright &amp; happy.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4152">2. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0839">4. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n0259">7. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt

      (1844–1890) was a fervent Irish patriot who joined the British Army in
      order to sabotage it. He was arrested and sentenced to be hanged in 1866. Later
      the decree was altered, and O'Reilly was sent to Australia, where he escaped on
      an American whaler in 1869. In 1876 he became the coeditor of the Boston <em>Pilot</em>, a position which he held until his death in 1890.
