   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1515">1. In May 1876, Whitman met Edward
      Cattell, a young farm hand and a friend of the Staffords. The poet took an
      interest in the Cattell family: "about 25 or 6—folks mother, father
      &amp;c. live at Gloucester—his grand, or great grandfather, Jonas Cattell,
      a great runner, &amp; Revolutionary soldier, spy." Whitman referred to Jonas in
      the <em>Philadelphia Times</em> on January 26, 1879. Whitman took
      special interest, however, in Edward, as charged entries from one of his diaries
      make clear: "the hour (night, June 19, '76, Ed &amp; I.) at the front gate by
      the road." Two days later he noted "the swim of the boys, Ed. [Stafford?], Ed.
      C. &amp; Harry" (<em>Diary Notes</em> in Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection). In 1877 Whitman cited "Sept meetings Ed C by the pond at Kirkwood
      moonlight nights" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.), and in <em>Diary Notes</em> on October 29, "Ed. Cattell
      with me."<a href="#r1">[back]
