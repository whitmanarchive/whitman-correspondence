   <p>I am now fairly settled down here for the summer, have pretty well caught up with
      my
      work and am looking forward to a pleasant summer. The weather lately is
      heavenly—just pleasant temperature, pure blue sky with a white cloud floating
      here and there, a cool fresh breeze blowing. The syringas are coming out and the
      first roses are showing in the rosebeds. It is the cream of the year and the place
      has never been quite so beautiful before. If you could only be here for a month! I
      think I told you that Mrs O'Connor<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r2">2</a></sup> gave me a copy of
      Harrington<sup><a href="#loc.07351_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I have read it with the deepest
      interest—the book shows immense ability but what
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>interested me more than the story was to trace O'Connor as he then was in the
      background of the narrative. I was greatly interested to see that even in '60 he
      knew his L. of G. He must have had it almost or quite from the first (from '55).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>At the back of the book (Harrington) the Thayer &amp; Eldridge<sup><a href="#loc.00568_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> L. of G. ('60) is advertised, and belows another book,
      by same author, is announced, viz: "Banner at Daybreak."<sup><a href="#loc.00579_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      Your idea at that time seems to have been to print successive books in the way of
      the usual writer.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Have just received a letter from my brother Eustace<sup><a href="#loc.07351_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> of Ottawa
      containing this comical passage "I was told by a lady here last Sunday that Walt
      Whitman was living with his wife in a wretched hovel in the States in great poverty
      and neglect—she supposes that as soon as he is dead the will raise a great
      monument to him, and spend thousands of dollars on a grand funeral" Eustace laughed
      at the good lady and relieved her mind upon some of the above points.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Have you written that Preface yet for O'C.'s stories?<sup><a href="#loc.07351_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4137">2. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

      abolitionist novel <em>Harrington: A Story of True Love</em>
      (Thayer &amp; Eldridge, 1860) was his only novel. Thayer &amp; Eldridge
      published the novel the same year as Whitman's 1860, third, edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00568_n3">4. Thayer and Eldridge was a
      Boston publishing firm responsible for the third edition of Walt Whitman's <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde [1829–1896] and Charles W. Eldridge

   <p id="loc.00579_n2">5. Whitman had sent Thayer and
      Eldridge the text for a full-page announcement of his proposed new volume of
      poetry,<em>The Banner At Day-Break</em> (though the book was
      never published). The advertisement discussed here appears at the back of
      William Douglas O'Connor's <em>Harrington</em> and describes <em>The Banner At Day-Break</em> as "a handsome volume of about
      200 pages," including the new poems "Banner At Day-Break," "Washington's First
      Battle," "Errand-Bearers," "Pictures," "Quadrel," "The Ox-Tamer," "Poemet,"
      "Mannahatta," "The Days," and "Sonnets," plus a "supplement containing
      criticism." (For a discussion of Whitman's plans for <em>The
         Banner At Day-Break</em>, see Ted Genoways, <em>Walt Whitman
         and the Civil War</em> [University of California Press, 2009],

      (b. 1831). His occupation is unknown, but according to Seaborn's Genealogy of
      the Bucke family (MS) Philip Eustace "Left home when 16 . . . crossed ocean 92
      times . . . Retired at 55—spent rest of time in making rods &amp;

         Tales: The Ghost, The Brazen Android, The Carpenter</em> (Boston and New
      York: Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., 1892). The preface was included in <em>Good-Bye My Fancy</em> (1891), 51-53.<a href="#r7">[back]
