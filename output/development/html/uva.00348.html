   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Bayard Taylor
      (1825–1878), translator of Goethe's <em>Faust,</em>
      journalist, and traveler, sent his "Picture of St. John" to Whitman on . He commended Whitman's
      "remarkable powers of expression" and "deep and tender reverence for Man." His
      letter of  was even more
      unreserved in its praise. Later Taylor's enthusiasm for Whitman was to change
      dramatically. In <em>The Echo Club</em> (2d ed., 1876),
      154–158, 168–169, Taylor burlesqued Whitman's poetry. William Sloane
      Kennedy lists him among Whitman's "Bitter and Relentless Foes and Villifiers";
      see <em>The Fight of a Book for the World</em> (West Yarmouth,
      Massachusetts: The Stonecroft Press, 1926), 288. See also "Letter from Walt
      Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 1 January 1867" in Edwin Haviland Miller,

      Press, 1961–69), 1:305.
