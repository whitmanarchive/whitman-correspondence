      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose it must look fine down there after the heavy rain last night—we had
      it here nearly all night, pouring &amp; thundering—along the Hudson in New
      York it was a furious hailstorm, destroyed all the growing fruit &amp;
      grain—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing very new with me—the big Boston house has sent me word that they will
      publish my book for me—&amp; I have sent them back word that I must have a
      bigger percentage than they offer—So that's the way it stands now—I find
      I can have them publish it, if I choose, but I suppose I am getting pretty lofty in
      my old days &amp; must have my own terms, &amp; pretty good ones too—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am feeling pretty well—I think my last visit down there did me good, real
      good after all—it has been very hot &amp; unpleasant ever since I came up, 
      till
      
       last night, but is now very nice, &amp; a prospect of some pleasant days,
      sufficiently cool—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am alone in the house, have been all day—My sister went out with a number of
      lady friends to spend the day in Fairmount Park, &amp; have dinner there, &amp; a sort
      of <em>woman spree</em> among themselves—I got my dinner
      myself—cooked it by the gas stove, &amp; eat it in <em>delightful company</em>, viz: myself!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have got a long letter from Edward Carpenter, he has quite a good deal to say of
      the death of his mother—she was quite worn out, died three or four months
      ago—he is living with a friend, a farmer &amp; his wife—his address is
      <em>Bradway, near Sheffield, England</em>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There has been the most terrible accident up at 
      Dr
      
       Bucke's town in Canada, a crowded steamboat capsized &amp; over 200
      drowned—I knew several—none of 
      Dr
      
      
      
      B's
      
       folks however—Well I suppose you are in the agonies of the church
      festival—how did Wm Heiniken's affair turn out?—I hope Theodore is
      most well by this time—I may go on to New York for a short visit—if not
      I shall come down soon, for two or three days—will send you
      word—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05139_n1">1. This letter is cited in
      Whitman's Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Whitman was
      with the Staffords from May 13 to 26, 1881; on May 8 he began negotiations with
      Osgood &amp; Company concerning publication of the 1881 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (see the letter from Whitman to James R.
      Osgood of ). Edward Carpenter wrote on
      May 14 (lost); see the letter from Whitman to Carpenter of . Theodore and William Heiniken (or
      Hieniken) were apparently brothers or perhaps son and father; see the letter
      from Whitman to Harry Stafford of .<a href="#r1">[back]
