   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00047_n1">1. The envelope for this letter
      bears the address: John Burroughs | Esopus-on-Hudson | Ulster County New York.
      It is postmarked: Philadelphia | June | 22 | 3 PM.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00047_n2">2. It was "with real
      reluctance" that Edward Carpenter returned to England after coming under "the
      added force of bodily presence" (<em>Days with Walt Whitman</em>,
      [New York: The Macmillan Company, 1908], 32).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00047_n3">3. Apparently Whitman, with
      his customary optimism, considered that Louisa's health had improved. See the
      letter from Whitman to Emma Dowe of .<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="prc.00047_n4">4. Joseph B. Marvin, one of
      Walt Whitman's Washington friends, visited Anne Gilchrist shortly after her
      arrival in Philadelphia in September, 1876 (Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist, <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em> [London: T.F.
      Unwin, 1887], 228). Marvin had been co-editor of <em>The
         Radical</em> in 1866-1867. Later he was employed in the Treasury Department
      in Washington. On , Marvin wrote
      to Whitman: "I read and re-read your poems, and the 'Vistas,' and more and more
      see that I had but a faint comprehension of them before. They surpass
      everything. All other books seem to me weak and unworthy my attention. I read,
      Sunday, to my wife, Longfellows verses on Summer, in the last Atlantic, and then
      I read your poem on the Death of Lincoln. It was like listening to a weak-voiced
      girl singing with piano 
      accompanyment
      
      , and then to an oratorio by the whole Handel Society, with 
      accompanyment
      
       by the Music Hall organ" (Library of Congress). Marvin's veneration of
      Whitman is also transparent in an article in <em>The Radical
         Review</em>, I (1877), 224-259.<a href="#r4">[back]
