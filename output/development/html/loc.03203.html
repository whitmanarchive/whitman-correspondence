      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The old war refrain—"All's quiet on the Potomac"—seems to have a new
      rendering in my thought as I go about my daily work: "All silent in Camden." I hear
      nothing &amp; see nothing in the public prints. But I dare say if I could cross the
      old ferry &amp; stop at "328"—I suppose you still insist on your own
      number—I should find life enough vocal &amp; contented.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I frequently chance upon your friends here in this city.</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>One such wrote a 2 column article for the <u>Evening Journal</u>
      of May 31. He allows me to send it to you on condition that I will charge you to <u>return it</u>, as it is the only copy he owns, &amp; wishes it
      for his <u>scrap book.</u> He is an Englishman—knows George 
      Elliot
      
      <sup><a href="#n3044" id="r2">2</a></sup>, Tennyson<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r3">3</a></sup>, Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r4">4</a></sup>, I believe &amp; others. Prof Dowden<sup><a href="# n0199" id="r5">5</a></sup> of
      Somersham—one of your English friends, is his friend. He detests 
      Swinburn
      
      <sup><a href="#n0610" id="r6">6</a></sup>, &amp; will have an article in <u>Tribune</u> Sunday on
      Gladstone's<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r7">7</a></sup> saying that .S would be next poet-laureate.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>He asked how you took 
      Swinburn
      
      's "Apostacy." I [
      <span class="unclear">responded?</span>]
      ,—"Serenely." But he is a bit mad, &amp; says he has
      long been so knowing the "sham" that 
      Swinburn
      
       is.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This man's name is Henry Latchford<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r8">8</a></sup>. He was sent to me the other day by Mr Dalton<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r9">9</a></sup>, the
      [
      <span class="unclear">Ethical
         preacher?</span>]
      . He seems a man of ideas &amp; good sympathies—is a
      journalist—independent; that is, not attached to one journal, but writing for
      several on topics of his own selection. He came and chatted with me an hour ago.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>and, in departing, asked permission to write a paragraph for the journal about my
      work. I enclose the "paragraph." He got some things mixed &amp; not as I would have
      had it stand, had I seen the proof—or knowing he was going to "repeat" at such
      length. One thing, I would not have spoken of your Georgia friend<sup><a href="#n0914" id="r10">10</a></sup> as a "nuisance."
      Nor did I imply. I recall just what I said. "He stayed some time &amp; almost came
      to be a nuisance, but made up for
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>it in part at least, by the bright things he would say, &amp; [
      <span class="unclear">that?</span>]
       "old varmint" story.<sup><a href="#loc.03203_n2" id="r11">11</a></sup>
      I have always kept green a kind feeling for the old man, for there was something
      rather poetic in his leaving his home &amp; journeying so far to see the man whose
      poems had so much interested him. Peace be to him, any way, &amp; may he not see
      this half-unkind printed word of mine.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nor did I say that you got "tired &amp; sloppy." I think I said something about your
      sitting silently
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>
      museing
      
      —or something like that. I don't remember that he asked me the
      question he puts in print at all. But it fitted in for him to report that [
      <span class="unclear">"property" recital?</span>]
      .
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But he made the worst mess about the Holmes talk, &amp; my contempt for <u>facts</u>. I was only arguing as to what the <u>fact</u> is, in any portraiture, &amp; against reliance on the
      merely critical greatly—the <u>conscious</u>
      criticism—or fault-finding, tinkering criticism. That was where "brains" got
      in the way. Holmes never cried, "Hold on!" &amp;c, but told the little story
      accidentally one
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>day.</p>
   
   
   <p>But—its all in a life time. All sores heal now-a-days inside a week.</p>
   
   
   <p>I mean to Send Some George 
      Elliot
      
       plaques to Camden when I get them out—The original is
      done—&amp;wants only some duplicates.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Latchford likes the Whitman bust as represented in part of Horace's<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r12">12</a></sup> book. He laughed
      out—"Its more like Walt than anything I've ever seen—"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, I am here yet in</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>the tails—trying to sing charity—"Blessed be poverty." I have many
      friends—more friends than money, &amp; I suppose that is as it should be. If
      they could not forever be taking <u>me</u> for a millionaire! Its
      awkward when your [
      <span class="unclear">previous?</span>]
       are fond to have it expected that that you will easily
      enough spend time &amp; dollars for their good pleasure. I manage after a fashion to
      either conquer or disgust them.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I calculate that H. is busy, busy. I see his articles now &amp; then in "New
      Ideal"—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Chicago is after the World's Fair with a vengeance on all contesters. Its so like
      Chicago. I never was in so 
      partizan
      
       an atmosphere, as I encounter here by Lake Michigan. You <u>must</u> be "d___d some" of everything, or you are nobody. You
      don't count. You're like the democrats in Speaker

   <p>I've made a little painting of you which is by far the best <u>painting</u> I have ever done. I expect to sell it to a lady here in C. I'd
      like you Camden folk to see it, but dont see how you can.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I find myself drawing toward a renewal of the little statue first began in your
      parlor. I can reproduce that from memory, I go on with it; but incline to some
      change in posture.

   <p>Is that Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r14">14</a></sup> still with you—Give him my best regards. I remember the old
      kitchen, &amp; all things well. And Aunt Mary.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sidney H. Morse was a
      self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to 1872,
      editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden many
      times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier bust by
      Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan, <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art, 1850–1920</em>

   <p id="n3044">2. "George Eliot" was the pen name of
      Mary Ann Evans (1819–1880), one of the most influential British writers of
      the nineteenth century. Her works include <em>The Mill on the
         Floss</em> (1860), <em>Middlemarch</em> (1871–1872), and
      <em>Daniel Deronda</em> (1876). Whitman was especially
      enamored by Eliot's essay writing: "She is profound, masterful: her analysis is
      perfect: she chases her game without tremor to the very limit of its endurance"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.109.html">Wednesday, October 31, 1888</a>).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n0625">3. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0141b">4. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0610">6. Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) was a
      British poet, critic, playwright, and novelist. He was also one of Whitman's
      earliest English admirers. At the conclusion of <em>William Blake:
         A Critical Essay</em> (1868), 300–303, Swinburne pointed out
      similarities between Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly
      Rocking" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the
      most sweet and sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world." His
      famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America" is included in <em>Songs
         before Sunrise</em> (1871). For the story of Swinburne's veneration of
      Whitman and his later recantation, see two essays by Terry L. Meyers, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00740.pdf">Swinburne and Whitman: Further Evidence</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0914">10. John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.<a href="#r10">[back]

   <p id="loc.03203_n2">11. The interview Morse refers
      to has not been located, but the passages he refers to, including the "old
      varmint" story, appear in a similar form in "My Summer with Walt Whitman, 1887,"
      in <em>In Re Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1893),
      367-392.<a href="#r11">[back]

   <p id="n4267">12. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
