      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I wrote you a line from Libby Prison a few days after I was taken prisoner, but think
      it doubtfull if you received it. I was taken, (along with almost our entire Regt. both Officers
      and men) on the 30th day of September, near the Weldon Rail Road, but am proud to
      think that we stood and fought untill we were entirely surrounded, &nbsp;Major Wright, Lieuts Pooley, Sims,<sup><a href="#duk.00364_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> and 9 other Officers<sup><a href="#duk.00364_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> of our Regt, are here, &nbsp;Capt Walton<sup><a href="#duk.00364_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> and Lieut Butler<sup><a href="#duk.00364_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> was wounded, but I dont know how badly, &nbsp;I am very well indeed, and in tip top spirits, am tough as a mule,
      and about as ugly, and can eat any amount of corn bread, so you see, <em>dear Mother</em> that I am all right, and my greatest trouble is that you will worry about me, but
      I beg of you not to frett, as I get along first rate.<sup><a href="#duk.00364_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Please write to Lieut. Babcock<sup><a href="#duk.00364_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Co. F of our Regt. and tell him to send my things home by Express. Much love to all.
      &nbsp;G. W. Whitman

   <p id="duk.00364_n5">5. George Whitman was soon
      to become seriously ill from "lung fever" during his confinement at the
      Confederate Military Prison at Danville. From December 3, 1864, to January 11,
      1865, he was a patient in the prison hospital. Furthermore, on May 9, 1865, not
      long after George and the other members of his regiment had been released in a
      general exchange, Walt Whitman recorded in his journal that Lieutenant Colonel
      John G. Wright, commanding officer of the Fifty-First Regiment, told him that
      George "had got much weakened, &amp; was evidently failing; but to all inquiries
      of his fellow officers, answered, 'O I feel well enough; there's nothing the
      matter with me of any account.' Col. Wright said that at length one day he found
      that George acted very strangelyâ€”he was seriously ill, &amp; was delirious. He
      had thin &amp; wretched clothing, although it was in the midst of winter"
