      Walt Whitman
      
      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I<sup><a href="#loc.00588_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup> fear you took me last night for a female privateer. It's true that I was sailing
      under <em>false colors</em>.—But the flag I assure you covered nothing piratical—although I would joyfully have
      made your heart a captive.
   </p>
   
   <p>Women have an unequal chance in this world. Men are its monarchs, and "full many a
      rose is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness in the desert air."<sup><a href="#loc.00588_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Such I was resolved should not be the fate of this fancy I had long nourished for you.—A gold mine may be found by the Divining
      Rod but there is no such instrument for detecting in the crowded streets of a great
      city the [unknown?] mine of latent affection a man may have unconsciously inspired
      in a woman's heart. I make these explanations in extenuation not by way of apology.
      My social position enjoins precaution &amp; mystery, and perhaps the enjoyment of my friend's
      society is heightened which in yielding to its fascination I preserve my incognito;
      yet mystery lends an ineffable charm to love and when a woman is bent upon the gratification of her inclinations—She is pardonable if she
      still spreads the veil of decorum over her actions. Hypocrisy is said to be "the homage
      which sin pays to virtue," and yet <em>I</em> can see no vice in that generous sympathy with which we share our caprices with those
      who have inspired us with tenderness,—
   </p>
   
   <p>I trust you will think well enough of me soon to renew the pleasure you afforded me
      last P.M., and I therefore write to remind you that there is a sensible head as well
      as a sympathetic heart, both of which would gladly evolve wit &amp; warmth for your direction &amp; comfort.—You have already
      my whereabouts &amp; my hours—It shall only depend upon you to make them yours and me
      the happiest of women.
   </p>

      <br></br>Yours sincerely,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00588_n100">1. "Ellen Eyre" was one of
      conman William Kinney's various pseudonyms. In 1862 Kinney managed to establish
      a fraudulent medical practice on Broadway between 8th and 9th under the name
      "Dr. B. Coffin." Running his scam as Dr. Coffin during the day, Kinney's
      evenings were spent posing as "Mrs. Ellen Eyre." As Eyre, Kinney would send
      letters to prominent men in New York; the men would agree to meet Eyre at the
      time and place appointed by her in the letter. As Ted Genoways notes, "What
      exactly transpired thereafter is veiled in niceties of the period, but the
      letters from several suitors, published later in the <em>Sunday
         Mercury</em>, are highly suggestive. One invited Eyre for some 'twilight
      entertainment,' another thanked her for 'your "loving kindness" at our last
      meeting.' One man, offended at being asked for money, wrote that he never
      considered 'our tender relations in the light of a financial operation.'" Kinney
      was eventually arrested after a sting operation exposed Ellen Eyre's true
      identity: Kinney performing sexual favors dressed as a woman and later
      blackmailing men to keep the affair discrete. For further discussion of Ellen
      Eyre's identity and Kinney's interaction with Whitman consult Ted Genoways, <em>Walt Whitman and the Civil War</em> (Berkeley: University of
      California Press, 2009), 154–159.<a href="#r1">[back]

      appear in Thomas Gray's poem "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard": "Full many
      a gem of purest ray serene, / The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear: / Full
      many a flower is born to blush unseen, / And waste its sweetness on the desert
      air."<a href="#r2">[back]
