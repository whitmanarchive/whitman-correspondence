      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Thank you for the kind postal card<sup><a href="#nyp.00566_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Does Wm<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r3">3</a></sup> care ab't
      having papers (Critic, Boston Trans: &amp;c) sent—&amp; is he mostly at the
      house in O street—or to be address'd at the office? I think every day about
      him, &amp; am almost feverishly anxious to do something—Would like at the
      least to send papers &amp; letters to while away the time—but fear being
      intrusive with them—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am living here in a little wooden house of my own, with a kind Jersey woman (a
      sailor's widow Mrs: Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r4">4</a></sup>) for housekeeper &amp; cook—am totally bodily
      disabled as to locomotion &amp;c.—but good heart—&amp; eating,
      digestion, sleep-power &amp;c. fairly active—I am sitting here in a big arm
      chair by the open window as I write—hot weather here too for eight
      weeks—but I have stood it—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years, and he speaks often in his letters of their daughter Jean, by nickname
      "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break in late
      1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated black citizens,
      Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence between Whitman and
      Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For
      more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see also Dashae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

      D. Kummings, ed., (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
