      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I came off down here on Tuesday, having lectures to give at Cardiff and Swansea on
      Tuesday &amp; Wednesday nights. Now I am staying a few days over with a bright young
      fellow who has a cottage here overlooking the pleasant sweep of Swansea
      Bay;—after over-work day &amp; night in town, you can imagine how good it seems to
      have the sea hard-by, &amp; the free sea-wind a-blowing.
   </p>
    
   
   
   <p>"The sea-wind &amp; the sea<br>Made all my soul in me<br>A song for
      ever!"<sup><a href="#loc.03336_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
    
   
   <p>In an hour or two, we shall set off for a two or three days tramp through the remote
      sea-slopes of Gower. The coast scenery is said to be very fine. We will expect to reach
      the lovely headland of Worm's Head some time to-morrow, stopping on the way at King
      Arthur's Seat, &amp; putting up for the night at some old country inn. Altogether it is
      just the sort of excursion that you would delight in, could you only be with us!
   </p>
   
   <p>Meanwhile I am glad to forget town &amp; things literary, &amp; to loafe &amp; take it easy here,
      though the
      post brings occasional reminders that London still exists. I must not forget, by the
      way, to say that a note has come to say a package (of portraits presumably) from
      you, awaits my return. For this again, best thanks! I shall be able now to get on
      with my article for the 'Scottish Art Review' as soon as I am back in town. A day
      or
      two before I left, Ed. Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r2">2</a></sup> spent an evening with me. He
      showed me your last letter to him. He was well. I devoutly pray that you are not
      suffering so much as you were.
   </p>

      With deep love,—
      <br></br>Ernest <u xmlns="">Rhys</u>

   <p>Swansea Bay is famous for its oysters. The flavour they are were like the
      American, though small in size. Wish I could send you some!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Rhys
      (1859–1946) wrote on : "Let me
      say simply in a young man's way to you who are an old man now, how dearly and
      earnestly I think of you across the sea to-night, remembering the Past, looking
      on to the great to-morrow, for perhaps of all young men you have helped me most
      powerfully &amp; perfectly." On  Rhys
      proposed a one-shilling edition of Whitman's poetry in <em>The
         Canterbury Poets</em> series. On  Rhys wrote for the third time after waiting "for a reply
      so far in vain," and included the payment from Walter Scott, the English
      publisher of <em>The Canterbury Poets</em>. On Rhys's letter
      Whitman wrote: "the little English selection from L. of G. is out since, &amp;
      the whole edition (10,000) sold." For more information about Rhys, see Joel
      Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0141b">2. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
