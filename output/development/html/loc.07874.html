   <p>I have delayed sending you the enclosed check until now, thinking I would have
      been over myself to see you, but as I may be delayed on account of the unusual
      press of business, I herein send check for $50.00 in sentiment for the
      autobiography and for the poem. Please find enclosed proofs of a page of poetry
      which please return after you have examined it
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will send or bring the proof of the autobiography<sup><a href="#loc.07874_n4" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      in a few days, in the meantime, if you see Mr. Traubel, will you tell him to
      please hurry up with his part of the work.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>With all good 
      wished
      
       for your good health and prosperity for the New Year,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.04667_n1">2. Stoddart
      (1845–1921) published <em>Stoddart's Encyclopaedia
         America</em>; established <em>Stoddart's Review</em> in 1880,
      which was merged with <em>The American</em> in 1882; and became
      the editor of <em>Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</em> in 1889. On
       Whitman received an invitation from
      Stoddart through J. E. Wainer, one of his associates, to dine with Oscar Wilde
      on January 14 (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and

   <p id="n4267">5. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

      Osler's absence, beginning on July 8, Whitman was attended by Dr. J. K.
