      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt, my beloved master, my friend, my bard, my prophet and
      apostle
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I must write something to you now. I have tried during four years, but was not
      satisfied with my effort. Let my earnest will compensate for the imperfect manner
      +
      matter. I am only a poor clerk in a law library, I know, + it would be presumption
      on my part to write to any stranger in this way, but you are not a stranger to me,
      you are my dearest companion: and, if you feel displeased, you have brought it on
      yourself for none who understandingly read you can help loving you. I am not going
      to praise your poetry to you (we don't usually tell the sun that he does well to
      shine + shines well, or the grass do we praise for being green) + in regard to your
      other writings will only say that your hint re sunbaths has saved me many a day's
      illness + your essay on Carlyle has told me once a wanderer in the desert [
      <span class="unclear">cracked?</span>]
       by a material
      sun, that there is a night too glowing with star-life (in a word it caused me to
      study Hegel).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Sometimes I take myself out of myself + gaze at what is going on in my mind. I often
      notice that I am defending you even when this 
      unbiassed
      
       apart-Ego know or believe that you are a little wrong. We have great
      fights over you
      sometimes. My mates + I myself try to spread you everythwere + we find that every
      reverent student gets to love you while those who merely glance at you are sometimes
      nearly as virulent against you as those of your maligners who have never read you
      at
      all. I think we have profitted morally also from your indirections. You have driven
      away a good deal of pessimism from us + we can now work light-heartedly in our small
      spheres. I was a Roman Catholic once, + had been, thus, for generations under
      pessimistic influences that the revelations of science could not drive away
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>My personal mates are Fred Woods, a draper, Jim Hartigan, a plasterer, an adorer of
      you, Ada [
      <span class="unclear">Fryer?</span>]
       a
      book-shop assistant (my sister-in-law) Ted Mackefer (a scapegrace, a swagman only,
      but a true mate of 11 years standing) + my wife. I am 24, red hair, plain features,
      a little too backward for my own good, fond of poetry, philosophy, science + going
      [
      <span class="unclear">long?</span>]
       walks,
      (Have got together a philosophy class of workmen + workwomen mainly + the avidity
      with which the revelations are seized is a pure pleasure to witness. My mates all
      send their love + I do so, enclosed by my own. We have a picture of you that
      appeared in a late Illustrated London News. It is over the mantelpiece + you seem
      quite at home with us. The other night several of us had the thought that you were
      listening as we were reading "Piers the Plowman" + that you were 
      sympathising
      
       with him in his despair, although pleased at hearing a poet of the
      "average man" of that day. It was the Walt Whitman of our souls that listened of
      course but the picture was suggestive of the other thought.
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish you hadn't quite confined (in words) your "home, I will make the continent
      indissoluble" to America. Most of us make America mean the world, or sometimes we
      put "Australia" in its place. But I mustn't criticize, I mean most to tell you that
      I love you, that my mates love you + that ere so very long, the whole world shall
      love you +, what is more, all prove their love by actions such as you would approve.
      Poetically + philosophically you have solved the great
      equationâ€”Spiritualising = materialism. The little Camelot volume of your
      poems, sells well in Melbourne, a bookseller tells me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I don't want to give you trouble, + so, as your correspondence must be extensive,
      will not expect an answer, honoured as I would feel by one. I sincerely hope that
      your physical life is happy now + that pain does not allay your spiritual glory.
   </p>
