   <p>Please find enclosed my check for $5.— for a copy of "Leaves of Grass." A little later
      on I shall also subscribe for "Two Rivulets"; but for the present content myself with
      the first named. My delay is because of my intuition to canvas my friends and secure additional subscribers and then remit to you in a body.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am connected with the Port-chester Journal which circulates between 6 &amp; 7000 copies.
      I mean to write an article of a couple of columns regarding Yourself and your poems
      and shall close it by soliciting subscribers for Your edition. Will You do me the
      favor of sending me a biographical sketch (to be used <u>in</u> the article) of your self and a spare photograph the latter to be used in illustration.
      Finally in soliciting the subscriptions shall we request parties to communicate direct
      with You or shall the 2'c receive &amp; forward them. I sincerely trust that Your health
      is improving &amp; that you may yet enjoy its best reestablishment
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Dr. Ferdinand Seeger (1846–1923) was a
      homeopathic physician from New York City, who once refused the Democratic
      nomination for mayor in order to focus on his medical practice, where he treated
      both wealthy and destitute patients (see his obituary as printed in the March
      10, 1923, edition of <em>Time</em>). Seeger sent checks for $5 on
      April 15 and 18, 1876 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection), and Walt Whitman
      forwarded two volumes on April 21, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace Book).
