   </p>
   
   <p>I have seen a paragraph in the press to the effect that you are not in good
      health.—I was sorry to read it, &amp; trust you will not regard as an intrusion a
      word of kindness and goodwill from an admirer and a friend, ten thousand miles
      away.—I was glad to have seen you before I left, and apparently destined to
      live many, many years.—I trust that what I have read was a mere newspaper
      exaggeration, and in sending you this wish, I send the assurances of my gratitude
      &amp;
      esteem, &amp; pray that it may find you enjoying a very happy New Year.—
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours sincerely,
      <br></br>Jno Russell Young.
      <br></br>Walt Whitman Esq.
