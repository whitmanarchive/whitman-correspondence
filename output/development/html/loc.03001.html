      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A postal card from Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r1">1</a></sup> yesterday tells me that you will
      write the preface for me to the volume of William's<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> stories. I
      can't tell you how glad I am! It is of all things just what I would wish.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The stories were all but "The Carpenter" written before you knew him, when he was very young, but
      some of them show great maturity in spiritual insight. "The Ghost" is my favorite,
      &amp; I have read it dozens of times,—&amp; some parts of it even yet I never
      can read without tears,—it is a noble &amp; sweet lesson. They are mostly Christmas stories.
      "The Brazen Android" has never been in type, save a part of it which the publishers
      had put into the printer's hands when William recalled it, &amp; sent back the money
      they had sent him, on it. I tell you all this, as you may not remember. His friends have been urging me to
      collect &amp; have the stories made into a volume, with a sketch, or a little
      biography, or something,—but I have been unable to see how or what to do, till the idea to have
      you write this for me came like an inspiration! I saw at once that it was just the
      thing, &amp; would give the book just what it needs. Your name &amp; William's will
      be [illegible] in many ways, &amp; this
      loving word from you will be a comfort to me for all time. Any facts or any thing that you
      may want, ask for, I shall only be too happy to give.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>The book will have a sale, I know, if you write the preface.</p>
   
   <p>You will think &amp; <u>brood</u> over it, &amp; the right thought will come I
      am sure. The stories with the new one, will be seven in number.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you are feeling well this perfect June 1<u>st</u> day.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
