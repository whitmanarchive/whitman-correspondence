      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Since the receipt of your last letter to D<u>r</u> Johnston,<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r1">1</a></sup> I cannot help thinking continually about you and
      the—complicated disorders your letter reported. And so,—though I have
      nothing else to write about,—I want to send you a line or two again to express my loving
      sympathy with you and my best wishes. I hope that you are better than when you
      wrote, + I am anxious to hear a better report.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>After about a fortnight's post, we have had today a heavy fall of snow. The young
      moon shines brightly tonight, + it is again freezing. It seems likely that we shall have an
      "old-fashioned" (frosty) Christmas.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>The weather is very different to that in which D<u>r</u> Johnston
      visited you, and I try to imagine you—in these short, dark days—confined
      to the room which D<u>r</u> J's description + photographs have made so
      familiar—solitary and ill—It reminds me of my mother's condition in her
      last years—lame, suffering + much alone—and my heart goes out to you
      like a son's.
   </p>
   
   <p>But, as circumstances darkened, she herself only seemed to grow sweeter and more
      loveable,—more
      loving, tender + self-forgetting and her faith deeper and 
      highter
      
      . And I, too, learned to love her more + more.
   </p>
   
   <p>Day by day your influence is spreading, and new friends are learning to appreciate
      and to love you, with grateful reverence, and a personal affection such as no one ever aroused
      before.—I am deeply grateful that I, for one, am—privileged to write to
      you, and to act as spokesman for an increasing multitude of others who are not so
      privileged, but who, like myself, will think of you at this season with loving
      good-will and tender sympathy. God bless you + all your household
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
