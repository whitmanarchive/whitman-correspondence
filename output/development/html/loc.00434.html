      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I received your letter<sup><a href="#loc.00434_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> to day &nbsp;glad to hear that you was getting along so nicely and feeling so well—I hope
      you will write me often &nbsp;I feel very sad and downhearted to-night—I have just been
      reading about the prisoners as detailed before the committee on the conduct of the
      war<sup><a href="#loc.00434_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &nbsp;is'nt it perfectly awful—have just read also Butler's speech<sup><a href="#loc.00434_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I begin to think that after all that it is quite likely that Gen Grant is the one
      that does not want to give an exchange—do you think that it is so—can it be that he
      is willing to let the men starve and die without result. I have almost come to the
      conclusion that it is hardly possible that the things that we send to George can reach
      him (yet I propose to keep sending, hoping that a proportion may do so.)<sup><a href="#loc.00434_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> and have for the last few days been trying to think of some other way in which he
      might be relieved—I see by the papers of to-day that a certain "Gen Haynes["] and
      a another a first Lieut in a Michigan Reg had arrived at Richmond from Danville to
      be specially exchanged<sup><a href="#loc.00434_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I have heard that they are making such special exchanges every now and then when the right "axe to grind" influence can be brought to bear—Now Walt
      if you will remember among the first men that blowed for Grant and wrote him up, so to speak was our friend John Swinton,<sup><a href="#loc.00434_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—When Grant visited New York the Dr<sup><a href="#loc.00434_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> says he sent for Swinton or expressed a desire to see him and Swinton called on him
      and they had a long interview—Swinton I believe passed quite a length of time with
      him on his Vicksburgh campaign &amp;c—Now I am positive that a letter could be got from
      Swinton to Grant signed as Editor of the Times asking that a speical exchange might be made in George's case<sup><a href="#loc.00434_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>—and I believe it would have effect—If Grant has charge of the matter and it could
      be made to look as if this great man—for I suppose of course he looks so to Grant—whatever
      may be the fact this editor of the administration paper of the City of New York desired
      the release of a certain man in fair exchange that it would be done—or at least they
      would be quite apt to do it.—Now Walt dont say that it would have no effect till you have thought the matter all over—the circumstances
      that are now surrounding the whole question—Gen Grant is just now in the position
      when a few words of censure in a print like the Times would do him great injury—I
      know he is in no danger of getting it from the Times yet he would—I should think like
      to make it sure by doing a supposed favor to its editor. Then it would be such a small thing for him to do. I fear that it is
      true that Grant has had charge of the matter for a long time and if so why then certainly
      he does not mean to exchange<sup><a href="#loc.00434_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> fearing that they will get good men for poor ones—Think the matter well over dear
      Walt—you can think of it in more bearings than I can—remember it would be but a small
      thing for us to attempt—If you would send me a note to Swinton asking him to do it
      for your sake I would willingly take it to him and plead for a trial—I could, I think—get
      Ruggles to ask him to do it—Poor mother reads about the treatment of prison[er]s and
      will set with her head in her hand for an hour afterward—she seems to feel it much
      more for the last few days than s[h]e did &nbsp;I feel as if we ought to do something—even
      if it looks flimsy and of no success on purpose to cheer Mother up—I am glad you wrote
      to Mason<sup><a href="#loc.00434_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> yet I hardly think he will send anything—he is a good enough fellow but of course
      would have very little interest in this matter—Do write me Walt at once what you think
      of the matter—If the matter is in Grants hands I am confident twould be a success. Swinton told Dr Ruggles that he would like to send George something
      in the way of provis[ions] &nbsp;the Dr also said he wou[l]d send something in the next
      box—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother is quite well—but downhearted &nbsp;Mattie and the children are very well and the
      young ones grow like everything—Last night Morris Roberts<sup><a href="#loc.00434_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup>—a friend of George's and Andrew's &nbsp;died of spotted fever—you of course remember him—he
      was ab of the poor—he caught it somehow connected with his business &nbsp;I understand that there
      is a great deal of it in the city some 9 cases in Johnson street near Navy—
   </p>
   
   <p>No news to tell—write me &nbsp;all send love—</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00434_n1">1. Walt Whitman had
      written to Jeff on .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00434_n2">2. This joint
      congressional committee, dominated by Radical Republicans, had been
      investigating the conduct of the war since December 20, 1861. Both the <em>Brooklyn Daily Union</em> and the <em>New York
         Evening Post</em> of January 31, 1865, carried Albert D. Richardson's
      testimony before this committee about the conditions in Southern prisons.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00434_n3">3. Brigadier General
      Benjamin Franklin Butler (1818–93), a controversial and outspoken Radical
      Republican, was dismissed from command by Grant's special order on January 7,
      1865. He was the last civilian commander in the Union army. On January 28 in
      Lowell, Massachusetts, he addressed four thousand people in a speech defending
      his war record and attacking the policies of his former superiors. Two days
      later the <em>New York Times</em> printed the entire speech,
      devoting almost the whole front page to it. Butler explained that in March 1864
      he had successfully conducted numerous prisoner exchanges but that Grant had
      ordered him to cease in the following terse telegram: "Do not give the rebels a
      single able-bodied man." Butler explicitly placed "the responsibility of
      stopping exchanges of prisoners...upon [Grant,] the Lieutenant-General
      commanding." The next day the <em>Times</em> characterized this
      speech as "exceedingly able, defiant, and mischievous" and "thoroughly
      insubordinate" in temper.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00434_n4">4. On February 3, 1865,
      Richardson would write in the <em>New York Tribune</em> that it
      took twenty-five to forty days for packages to reach prisoners and that only one
      of every six or ten reached its destination. Confederate officers, he charged,
      confiscated the rest.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00434_n5">5. In a brief note
      entitled "Arrivals at Libby Prison" the <em>New York Tribune</em>
      reported on this day that Brigadier General James Haynes and Lieutenant J. W.
      Lucas would leave military prison in Danville (where George Whitman was also
      held) to be "sent North by flag of truce."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00434_n6">6. John Swinton
      (1829–1901) was the managing editor of the <em>New York
         Times</em> and a strong supporter of Whitman and <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>. As a candidate of the Industrial Political party, Swinton ran
      for mayor of New York in 1874. After leaving the <em>Times</em>,
      he worked for the <em>New York Sun</em> from 1875 to 1883 and for
      the following four years edited <em>John Swinton's Paper</em>, a
      weekly labor journal.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00434_n7">7. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Jeff and Mattie Whitman. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest
      in his practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles
      Gems" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:90, n. 85).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00434_n8">8. Walt Whitman took
      Jeff's advice and wrote to Swinton on . On  Swinton replied,
      enclosing a letter for the poet to send to Grant.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00434_n9">9. In his letter to
      Whitman of , John Swinton noted
      that his letter to Grant (dated February 6) might not be "worth mailing. Since
      your letter was written, the statement has been published . . . that Grant has
      made the arrangements for a general exchange."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00434_n10">10. See Jeff Whitman's
      letter to Walt from .<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00434_n11">11. Morris H. Roberts
      (1828–65), a local baker and superintendent for the poor of the Western
      District of Brooklyn, died not of spotted fever as first reported, but of
      typhoid fever (<em>Brooklyn Daily Union</em>, January 31 and
      February 1, 1865).<a href="#r11">[back]
