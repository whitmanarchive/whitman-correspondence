   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00063_n1">1. The envelope for this
      letter bears the address: Herbert H. Gilchrist | 1929 North 22d Street |
      Philadelphia. It is postmarked: Camden | Jan 2 | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00063_n2">2. For confirmation of this
      date, see the letter from Walt Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist dated . Based on the information in this
      letter, the former letter must have been composed in the last days of 1876, not
      the early days of 1877, as previously supposed.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00063_n3">3. Walt Whitman ended up
      delaying his visit until January 10 to 16 and again from January 25 to February
      2.<a href="#r3">[back]
