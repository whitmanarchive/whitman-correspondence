   <p>In the name of <u>Calamus</u> listen to me! Before me hangs your
      beautiful <u>photograph</u>, twice precious, since it is your
      gift to me. Near at hand lies your beloved vol. and with it the <u>Notes</u> of Mr. 
      Burrough
      
      .
   </p>
   
   
   <p>May I not thank you for your picture and your letter? May I not tell you over and
      over that where I go 
      your
      
       go with me, in poem and picture and the little vol of notes also, for I
      read and reread trying to see you in the flesh as I so long to see you!
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>I wrote you last from the Sandwich Islands.<sup><a href="#loc.01944_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I shall
      before long be even farther from you than ever for I think of sailing towards Tahiti
      in about five weeks.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I know there is but one hope for me. I must get amongst people who are not afraid
      of
      instincts and who scorn 
      hypocracy
      
      . I am numbed with the frigid manners of the Christians; barbarism has
      given me the fullest joy of my life and I long to return to it and be satisfied. May
      I not send you a 
      proze
      
      
      <u>
         idyl
         
         </u> where in I  confess how dear it is to me?
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>There is much truth in it and I am praying that you may like it a little. If I could
      only know that it has pleased you I should bless my stars fervantly.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been in vain trying to buy from our Library a copy of your "Leaves" 
      Edt.
      
       of 1855—I think it your first &amp; I have somewhere read that you set the
      type for it yourself—Is it true? Do you think I could obtain a copy of it by
      addressing some Eastern publisher or book seller?
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>You say you "don't write many letters". O, if you would only reply to this within
      the
      month! I could then go into the South Seas feeling sure of your friendship and I
      should try to 
      life
      
       the real life there for your sake as well as for my own.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Forgive me if I have wearied you: I will be silent and thoughtful in future, but in
      any case know, dear friend that I am grateful for your indulgence.
