   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Josiah Hinton
      (1830–1901) was born in London and came to the U.S. in 1851. He trained as
      a printer, and, like James Redpath, went to Kansas and joined John Brown. In
      fact, but for an accident he would have been with Brown at Harper's Ferry. A man
      mistaken for Hinton was hanged. Together with Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Hinton
      also planned the jailbreak of John Brown's accomplices Albert Hazlett and Aaron
      Stevens in Charlestown for the "Jayhawkers," a band of abolitionists who
      assisted slaves through the Underground Railroad that included Silas S. Soule.
      With James Redpath he was the author of <em>Hand-book to Kansas
         Territory and the Rocky Mountains' Gold Region</em> (New York: J. H. Colton,
      1859). Later he wrote <em>Rebel Invasion of Missouri and
         Kansas</em> (Chicago: Church &amp; Goodman, 1865) and <em>John
         Brown and His Men</em> (New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company, 1894).
      Apparently Hinton had suggested that Thayer &amp; Eldridge print <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (see <em>The New
         Voice</em>, 16 [4 February 1899], 2). Hinton served in the Union Army from 1861
      to 1865, and saw Whitman while lying wounded in a hospital, a scene which he
      described in the Cincinnati <em>Commercial</em> on August 26,
      1871. After the war Hinton wrote for many newspapers. He defended William
      O'Connor's <em>The Good Gray Poet</em> in the Milwaukee <em>Sentinel</em> on February 9, 1866. Hinton's article in the
      Rochester <em>Evening Express</em> on March 7, 1866, "Farms and
      Fortunes in England and America," included a lengthy discussion of Whitman, with
      quotations from O'Connor and John Burroughs. Obviously pleased, Whitman sent it
      to friends, including William Michael Rossetti, who acknowledged it on  (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 9 vols., 2:123). See
      also Traubel, 2:396; William Sloane Kennedy, <em>The Fight of a
         Book for the World</em> (West Yarmouth, Massachusetts: The Stonecroft Press,
      1926), 19, 67, 110–111, 242; and the <em>Boston
         Transcript</em>, 21 December 1901.
