   <p>We are awfully pleased and excited at the war news. Feel as if the man<sup><a href="#loc.00416_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> had been appointed that was thinking less of political affairs than of licking the
      rebs. We are just getting news of the surrender of Vicksburgh. Hope to God that it
      is true. Bully for Meade!<sup><a href="#loc.00416_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> He has not only licked the rebs but the peace party headed by McClellan.<sup><a href="#loc.00416_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Hope that he will not let them off but will poke it into them &nbsp;How do you get along? I suppose you hardly have time to
      write me. I sent you a letter containing $15 last week<sup><a href="#loc.00416_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> &nbsp;did you get it?
   </p>
   
   <p>Nothing new at home &nbsp;I did not have any "time" on the 4th so I send you this money
      that I <em>might</em> have spent. do the little sums that we send you enable you to do any good.

   <p>Dear brother I am in a tremendious hurry, and you must excuse my letter. Mother sent you a letter a day or two since.
      Mattie and the babies<sup><a href="#loc.00416_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> are first-rate. Mother quite well. rest all right. Will write you again in a few
      days

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00416_n1">1. James P. Kirkwood
      (1807–1877), a prominent civil engineer and cofounder of the American
      Society of Civil Engineers (1852), superintended the construction of the
      Brooklyn Water Works as chief engineer from 1856 to 1862. After his work in
      Brooklyn, he moved to St. Louis and designed the waterworks which Jeff would
      later build. Kirkwood eventually became a nationally known independent
      consultant and wrote the standard text on water filtration.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00416_n2">2. John D. Martin was an
      engineer.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00416_n3">3. Charles E. Botsford
      sent Walt Whitman one dollar on July 7, 1863.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00416_n4">4. This is probably Grant.
      As Jeff explains, he was thinking specifically of the fall of Vicksburg, but he
      was also encouraged by news concerning the Gettysburg campaign.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00416_n5">5. Major General George
      Gordon Meade (1815–1872) succeeded Joseph Hooker as commander of the Army
      of the Potomac in June 1863, and led the army to victory at Gettysburg (July
      1–3, 1863).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00416_n6">6. General George Brinton
      McClellan (1826–1885) was General-in-Chief of the Army of the United
      States from November 1861, until July 1862, when he was replaced by General
      Henry W. Halleck. In 1864, when McClellan ran for the presidency, the Democratic
      party split between war Democrats and peace Democrats. To satisfy the war
      Democrats McClellan was nominated; to satisfy the peace Democrats C. L.
      Vallandigham and his followers were allowed to draft the platform. Jeff
      evidently considered the entire Democratic party as "the peace party."<a href="#r6">[back]
