   </p>
   
   
   <p>My recollection of what Miss — told me on the Friday evening,<sup><a href="#med.00639_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> just one week after President Lincoln's murder, and of
      the diagram she took out of her pocket in illustration, is as follows:
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The 
      Prest
      
       &amp; Mrs. Lincoln called for her &amp; her escort at the house of her
      father, Senator —, on their way to Ford's Theatre. As the four drove thither, Miss
      — was struck, she said, with the uncommon hilarity of the 
      Prest. He laughed &amp; joked &amp; was evidently bent on having a jolly
      evening. On getting to the theatre, and after some preliminaries as to position for
      the chairs, the party was finally arranged as shown on the diagram.<sup><a href="#loc.05584_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>The play was "Our American Cousin." I do not remember whether 
      Sothern
      
       was in it or not, but I recollect she said Miss Laura Keene was. I knew
      the play very well, &amp; recollect asking Miss — at what point in it the tragedy
      occurred, but her answer has escaped my memory. Mr. Lincoln laughed heartily at the
      comical situations &amp; dialogue of the play, and paid close attention to it (as he
      always did when I had an opportunity of seeing him at the theatre. Senator Sumner
      
       told once me that in a conversation the
      day before with Mr Lincoln, the latter had defended the 
      practise
      
       of habitual joking, and said that if he had not the opportunity to get out
      of himself by jests and an occasional visit to the theatre, he thought he should go
      crazy.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Miss —<sup><a href="#loc.05584_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> was leaning forward, she said, to catch some
      by-play that was going on at the back of the stage when suddenly she heard a pistol
      shot, and felt the odor of gunpowder. She felt too, she said (though she was by no
      means a sentimental young lady) that there was "a thrill in the air" and that
      "something dreadful was happening"; though nevertheless she imagined confusedly that
      the pistol shot must be part of the play, though she could see nothing 
      àpropos
      
       to it in the stage situation. Instead of discovering that the shot was
      fired behind her, she thought it was from the front. She therefore leaned still
      further out of the box, and recollected that she saw Miss Keene on the stage,
      evidently in great excitement.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>While she was telling me the story, she left me several times for a few minutes to
      go
      into the adjoining room, telling me her step-brother, (whom she afterwards married)
      was lying there suffering from the effects of a wound or other hurt (I don't
      remember with what weapon or missile) received on the occasion, but whether from
      Wilkes Booth, or from some one else in the 
      mêlée
      
       that followed, I can't recall, though she must have told me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Neither can I now, on reflection, say positively whether it was from her (though I
      am
      pretty sure it was) or afterwards from the press, I got the impression that even
      when Booth had jumped on the stage from her very side (for it must have been from
      the ledge of the box between 
       her &amp; Mr.
      Lincoln that he jumped) &amp; had shouted his cry of "Sic semper tyrannis" &amp; run
      off the stage, she still thought it was part of the play; and had not recognized
      that he had leapt from her box at all. Certainly this would naturally be so, if her
      mind was filled, as she said, with the notion that the excitement originated on the
      stage, and if she was stretching herself out of the box, to find out what it
      was.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But this I do remember as from herself: though the time that elapsed between the
      shot and her recovery from her dazed condition to an appreciation of the real
      circumstances must in reality have been very short indeed (take out your watch, look
      at the index of the minute dial go round for sixty seconds &amp; you will probably
      say it must have been within that
      time) the brief moments seemed to her "like an age," and there was something she
      could not explain, that made her feel "as if the world was coming to an end." A
      clever girl who had carried on, all through a stirring episode of history, a good
      part of her senator father's correspondence, and who had her own political &amp;
      sectional prepossessions,—it might very well be that her own emotions, on
      realizing what had just been accomplished, colored her perceptions, but
      psychologists would probably say that this inexplicable something, portentious
      of destruction &amp; death, was none the less a reality for being
      invisible &amp; intangible—that it was in truth a magnetic
      wave of aggregated human passion from those who looking up at the immediate scene
      of the tragedy
      had, unlike her, seen its action &amp; at once appreciated its consequences—it
      was a shock of wonder &amp; doubt—a flood of horror, awe, fury—a mute
      despairing call for succor that could not come—a wild outcry for vengeance that
      could not restore.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>After her description of her feelings just preceding, and on her realization of, the
      tragedy, the rest of the young lady's story was simply an anti-climax. She
      accompanied Mrs. Lincoln from the theatre &amp; was with her, I think she said, a
      good part of the night. One thing she told me however, in answer to a question of
      mine, interested me, for there was much gossip &amp; scandal afloat about Mrs.
      Lincoln's temper &amp; her abuse of her husband, &amp; part of the stories told I
      knew from competent &amp; trustworthy sources &amp; also, in a small measure, from
      my own observation, to be true. But it was also said, though it by no means followed
      as a corollary, that she did not love her husband—that she only valued him as
      the means to her ambition—and that this abuse was studied &amp; habitual. Miss
      —, in answer to several questions from me, said in substance that if ever a woman
      showed genuine grief on personal grounds, and apart from that arising from a mortal
      blow to her ambition, Mrs. Lincoln did so that fateful night.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00639_n2">1. Alfred Janson Bloor
      (1828–1917) was, he informed Whitman on , a member of the architectural staff that designed Central Park. He
      was a poet as well as the author of a number of architectural treatises. Whitman
      quoted from Bloor's letter at the conclusion of his article in the <em>Tribune</em> on May 24 (see <em>The Collected
         Writings of Walt Whitman: Prose Works 1892</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall [New
      York: New York University Press, 1964], 342). Bloor had taken exception to
      Whitman's contemptuous references to actors in his lecture on Lincoln's
      murder.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05584_n1">2. Here Bloor drew a diagram of
      the Theatre Box, labeled with circles indicating the locations of President
      Lincoln, Mrs. Lincoln, Miss —, and Major —. The Major — is
      Major Henry Rathbone. The Miss — is Miss Clara Harris. She did indeed
      marry her stepbrother, as Bloor goes on to note, though they were not related by
      blood. Her stepbrother, Henry Reed Rathbone, was badly wounded when he tried to
      stop John Wilkes Booth from fleeing the site of the assassination. Later in
      life, perhaps because he blamed himself for failing to stop the killing of
      Lincoln, he went mad, attacked his children, killed his wife who tried to
      protect them, and attempted to kill himself by stabbing himself in the
      chest.<a href="#r2">[back]
