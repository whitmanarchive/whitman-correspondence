      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of  with draft reach'd me which I responded to sending new edition "Leaves of Grass"
      and "Two Rivulets," 
      two or three days since, by mail, same address as this, which you ought to have rec'd now lately—sent postal card 
      briefly notifying you, &amp; asking you to send me word (by postal card will do) immediately
      on their reception.<sup><a href="#duk.00671_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To-day comes your affectionate, hearty, valued letter of , all right, with enclosure, draft 12£. 10s.<sup><a href="#duk.00671_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—all deeply appreciated—the <em>letter</em> good, cannot be better, 
      but, as always, the <em>spirit</em> the main thing—(altogether like some fresh, magnetic, friendly breath of breeze,
      'way off there from the Irish Coast)—I wonder 
      if you can know how much good such things do me. I shall send the six sets (six "Leaves"
      and six "Rivulets") 
      by express, very soon, (probably by next Philadelphia steamer.) The extra copies of
      "Memoranda of the War" 
      not being ready bound, at present, I will send by mail—six copies, before very long.
      (I hope the set above 
      mention'd I mailed you by last steamer, will have reach'd you before you get this.)
      I saw O'Grady's article 
      in the December "Gentleman's"<sup><a href="#duk.00671_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; from my point of view, he dwells on <em>what I like to have dwelt on</em>. I was deeply pleased 
      with the article, &amp; if I had O'Grady's address I would like to send him my photograph.<sup><a href="#duk.00671_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I also read the Peter Bayne article. 
      (It was copied in full here at once, &amp; circulated quite largely.)<sup><a href="#duk.00671_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> As I write this, I have not read Abraham Stoker's letter,<sup><a href="#duk.00671_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> but shall do so, &amp; carefully. (The names shall be written in the Vols. as you mention.)
      I read with great zest 
      the account of the discussion at the "Fortnightly"<sup><a href="#duk.00671_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—I have learn'd to feel <em>very thankful</em> to those who attack &amp; abuse &amp; pervert me—that's perhaps (besides being good fun)
      the only way to bring out the splendid ardor &amp; friendship of those, 
      my unknown friends, my best reward, art &amp; part with me, in my pages, (for I have come
      to solace &amp; perhaps flatter 
      myself that it is <em>they</em> indeed in them, as much as <em>I</em>, every bit.)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My condition physically is pretty much the same—no worse, at least not decidedly.
      I get out nearly every day, but not far, 
      &amp; cannot walk from lameness—make much of the river here, the broad Delaware, crossing
      a great deal on the ferry, 
      full of life &amp; fun to me—get down there by our horse cars, which run along near my
      door—get infinite kindness, 
      care, &amp; assistance, from the employés on these boats &amp; cars—My friend, next time you
      write say more about yourself, 
      family &amp; Mrs. Dowden, to whom with yourself best love &amp; regards—

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00671_n1">1. Dowden enclosed a draft
      for $10 on . Whitman sent the
      two books on March 2, 1876 (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.). The post card is lost, but Dowden received it on March 14, 1876; see
      Dowden's <em>Fragments of Old Letters, E. D. to E. D. W.,
         1869–1892</em> (London: Dent, 1914), 149.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00671_n2">2. On , Dowden ordered six copies of the
      new edition for friends, including Professor Atkinson of Trinity College,
      Dublin, and Bram Stoker. Whitman mailed the volumes on March 14, 1876, which
      Dowden mentions in his letter to Whitman dated .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00671_n3">3. "Walt Whitman: the Poet
      of Joy," by the Irish poet, Standish James O'Grady, appeared in the <em>Gentleman's Magazine</em>, 15, n.s. (1875), 704–716. See
      Whitman's  and  letters to Dowden.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00671_n4">4. Whitman sent the
      photograph to O'Grady about October 19, 1876 (Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00671_n5">5. Peter Bayne
      (1830–1896), a Scots journalist, in the <em>Contemporary
         Review</em> attacked Whitman's English admirers, William Michael Rossetti,
      Dowden, and Robert Buchanan, as well as <em>Leaves of Grass</em>:
      "While reading Whitman, . . . I realized with bitter painfulness how deadly is
      the peril that our literature may pass into conditions of horrible disease, the
      raging flame of fever taking the place of natural heat, the ravings of delirium
      superseding the enthusiasm of poetical imagination, the historians of tetanic
      spasm caricaturing the movements, dance-like and music-measured, of harmonious
      strength" (28 [December 1875], 49–69). Bayne's diloc.0157atribe was
      reprinted in <em>Littell's Living Age</em>, 28 (January 8, 1876),
      91–102. See also the <em>Nation</em>, 22 (January 13, 1876),
      28–29. In the <em>West Jersey Press</em> Whitman referred to
      "the scolding and cheap abuse of Peter Bayne" (Clifton Joseph Furness, <em>Walt Whitman's Workshop</em> [Cambridge: Harvard University
      Press, 1928], 246). See also Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1931), 121 and
