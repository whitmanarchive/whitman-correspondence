   <p>Mustered into [ &nbsp; ] by Capt [Hayman (?) at] New York [on] the 18th [of] Sept 1861,<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup> as a private in Co. G. 51st Regt. N.Y. Vols. and appointed Sergt. Major, of the Regt
      the [next] day by Colonel Fe[rrer]o<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>[Left] &nbsp;New York Oct 30th 1861 for Annapolis Md. by way of Philadelphia and Perryville.
      Arrived at Annapolis Oct 31st and took up our Quarters for a couple of days in the
      Academy Buildings in the Town, and then [ &nbsp; ] first camp in a field a[bout] a mile
      from the Villiage, and went to work, drilling and getting the Regt in shape for Service. After being
      in [charge?] a couple of months I [was?] taken sick with the [ &nbsp; ] Fever, and went
      down Toun to board with a family named Brigs where I stopped two or three weeks, when I was
      comeing around al[l] right &nbsp;I went back to camp and was soon entirely [well]
   </p>
   
   <p>[On] the evening of Jan 5th/62 received orders to strike tents at day light next morning,
      and immediately all hands went to work packing up and [ &nbsp; ], and at sunrise [on] the
      morning of the 6th our handsome camp of the day before was a heap of ruins. About
      7 O clock in the morning the order was given for the Regt. to fall in and we marched
      down to the dock where we were kept standing until late in the afternoon, when we
      went on board the vessels, the right wing of the Regt going on board the Transport
      Lancer and the Left on board the Ron[c]er, &nbsp;[ &nbsp; ] at night we hurried out [to] the
      Stream, where we lay untill Jan 8th when the signal was given to get under weigh, and we started for our (to
      us) unknown destination
   </p>
   
   <p>Arived at Fortress Monroe Jan 10th and came to anchor. Jan 12th the signal was given to
      get under weigh, and the old [R]oncer, on board of which I was, steamed up and we
      were off again &nbsp;We [kept] close in shore [fa]irly all the way and reached Hatteras
      Inlet on the 14th, but the Lancer had stood well out to sea (as her capt. was an old
      sea dog and wanted plenty of sea room) and did not reach the Inlet until some days
      after our arival. We found very few of our fleet had reached Hatteras before us, but
      they soon began to come in and as the wind blew a perfect hur[rica]ne nearly all the
      time, and the anchorage was bad, and the fleet crowded for room (as we had to [pay?]
      between two sand bars), &nbsp;there was the very devil to pay with vessels draging their anchors, and running afoul of each other, the weather being so bad we could
      not attempt to cross the bar which separates [Hatteras] Inlet from Pamlico Sound.
      The bad weather continued so long that all began [to] get discouraged [ &nbsp; ] the vessels
      were not large enough to accomodate the number of troops they had on board, and the rations began to get short as the
      weather was so stormy we could not get to the Storeship, to renew our supplys. [The water also] gave out and we were obliged to rig up sails to catch rainwater
      to drink. The water that fell on [ &nbsp; ] decks, and in the boats hanging at [ &nbsp; ] the
      davitts was carefully sc[oop]ed up and considered quite a [blessing] &nbsp;Almost every monring on comeing on deck we were greeted with the sign of flags of distress flying from some of the
      vessels that had been damaged during the night. Two or three of the vessels belonging
      to the Fleet were sunk and entirely destroyed, and at this time our prospects [lo]oked
      so discouraging that I felt satisfied that the Burnside Expedition<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> would prove a failure.
   </p>
   
   <p>Abo[ut] the 1[st] of Feb. the weather began to get better and some of the lighter
      draught vessels crossed the bar, and by the 5th we were all across and ready to proceed.
      On the morning of the 6th we [ &nbsp; ] got under weigh and ready to proceed. On the morning
      of the 6th we [ &nbsp; ] got under weigh and started for Roan[oke] Island. The fleet consiste[d]
      of 10 or 12 Gunboats, 12 or 14 Armed Transports (carrying 3 or 4 each [?]) and about
      60 river steamers and Schooners with Troops, Coal, provision [ &nbsp; ] Coast &nbsp;All the
      vessels proceeded in regular order, and it was a splendid sight, the Gunboats leading
      the way and the rest, all seeme to be straining to keep up, and not seem lazy, and anxious to [fall be]hind. Altogather, it was one of the finest sights I ever saw, the ships with all their flags flying
      and I began to think the Burnside Expedition was not quite played [ou]t after all,
      as it looked much more formidable, than when lying at Hatteras Inlet.
   </p>
   
   <p>On the night of Feb 6th we came to anchor in the sound, some 15 or 16 miles below
      Roanoke and on the morning of [the] 7th we proceeded on our course. On ariving with[in] 3 or 4 miles of where the rebel batteries were suppos[ed] to be &nbsp;the Transports
      halted and the Gunboats went ahead to reconn[irtue?]
   </p>
   
   <p>About 10 O clock a.m. one of the Gunboats opened the fight by sending a shot at the
      rebel Batteries on the shore. The rebels promptly replyed from their batteries and our Gunboats were soon well engaged. The rebel fleet consisting
      of 4 or 5 Small Gunboats kept blazing away at our boats, their intention evidently
      being, to get our vessels to try and capture them which would have brought our boats,
      right under the guns of a large earthwork that so far had kept quiet. It was quite
      amusing to see the rebels sail up to our fleet as close [as] they dare, fire a few
      [ &nbsp; ] and then turn and [ &nbsp; ] back and try and coax our folks to follow them, but
      the dodge wouldent work as our folds seemed to know the rebs were trying to lead them into a trap, so
      they kept [peging?] away at the batteries and paid very little attention to the rebel
      fleet. Early in the morning the troops were all taken off from such of the Transports
      as carried guns, and placed on board of small, high [d]raught vessels, that could
      run in close to shore to land troops. As soon as the action had fairly commenced all
      the Transports that had been relieved of their Troops sailed in and took a hand in
      the fight, and the way our fleet made the sand fly around the rebel works was a caution
      to eyes
   </p>
   
   <p>The bombardment was [k]ept up all day, without any great damage done on either side,
      as far as we could see. About 4 Oclock in the afternoon the signal was given for the
      troops to land, and a small boat was sent off with an Officer, and [ &nbsp; ] 6 men to
      pick out a good landing place, but on geting in near shore the party in the boat was fired on by a party of rebels, who were concealed
      in the tall grass on shore and one or two of them wounded, so they were obliged to
      come back and one of the gunboats ran in close to shore and shelled the woods and
      every where else where the enemy could conceal themselves.
   </p>
   
   <p>As soon as we received orders to land the old stern wheel steamboat with our Regt
      on board starte[d] for the shore and our Regt, and several others reached the shore
      about the same time and without seeing any thing of the enemy. We found the shore
      very boggy and covered with coarse grass about t[wo] feet high, and every time we
      [steped] we [sank] in mud and water half way up to our knees. As soon as we reached the shore
      we formed the Regt and pushed ahead about half a mile untill we came to dry ground, and here we were ordered to bivouac for the night. One Regt.
      of our Brigade (the 21st Mass) was sent out on picket and the rest of us after eating
      a hearty supper of [h]ard tack and crackers began to make preparations to retire.
      At this time there were Only two Brigades on Shore, the first commanded by Brididier Gen. Foster<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> and consisted of the 23d, 24th, 25th, and 27th Massachusetts, and our Brigade commanded
      by Brigr. Gen Reno<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> and consisting of the 21st Mass, 51st N.Y. 51st Penn. and 9th New Jersey.
   </p>
   
   <p>About 10 O clock at night it commenced to rain and continued showery all night. About
      9 O clock in the evening quite a brisk fire was opened on our Pickets, by the rebs
      and we were ordered to fall in. The men sprang quickly to their places, but the fireing slackened and we again broke ranks and tried to get a little sleep but it soon commenced
      to rain, so we passed [altoga]ther an [un]comfortable night. We were up bright and early in the morning (as in fact
      the most of us had been up nearly all night as we were completely soaked through with
      the rain) and found the 3d Brigade (commanded by Brig. Gen Parke<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> and consisting of the 8th 10th and 11th Conneticut and 9th N. Y. Regts) had landed during the night. so that we had quite a respectable
      force on shore. About 6 O clock on the morning of Feb 18th the whole force fell in
      line and comenced to move forward except part of the 3d Brigade which was left to hold a [ &nbsp; ] landing.
      The 1st Brigade took the lead and we soon heard fireing in advance and we knew that our advance was engaged with the rebel skirmishers
   </p>
   
   <p>In the meantime our fleet, who had ceased fireing at dark the night before, had commenced
      again at day light, and as the land force was now going in pretty sharp it sounded
      to us like a pretty [ &nbsp; ] fight, &nbsp;soon the wounded began to be brought by us, on their
      way to the rear, and things began to look a little like war &nbsp;Our Regt pressed ahead
      as fast as they could, the rebs retreating and our boys following them up, for as
      yet the 1st Brigade was all the troops engaged on our side, as the ground was such
      that we could not get to the front, &nbsp;After falling back about [a mile] and a half
      the rebs reached their battery where they made their final stand,
   </p>
   
   <p>The batteries was thrown up across the road, and was flanked on each side by swamps
      that they (the rebs) thought impossible &nbsp;The 1st Brigade was ordered to attack in
      front while part of our Brigade was ordered to force a passage through the swamp and
      attack on the left [a]nd part of the right
   </p>
   
   <p>Our Regt filed off to the left, and although we toiled hard, we made slow headway
      as the mud was up to our n\knees and the bushes, so thick that we often had to stop
      and [get away?] with our swords before we could get through. We were within easy rifle
      shot of our enemy's works but we could not see them nor they us alth[ou]gh they must
      have known we were there, as they kept up a pretty sharp fire on us all the while
      but as they could not do us much damage as most of their balls passed over our heads.
      After working two or three hours, the right of our Regt. succeeded in getting within
      sight of the rebel battery and our boys commenced to send the lead in there, in right
      good earnest, so that the rebs could not work their guns and as soon as they saw they
      were flanked they began to skedaddle &nbsp;Just then the order was given to charge the
      works, but [the] rebs dident stop to receive the charge, and when we got inside the works all the rebs, except
      the dead and wounded had gone. We found the battery mounted 3 guns 10 or 12 [Powder?]
      brass peices [w]ith caisoon and every thing complete, &nbsp;it was supposed from what we could learn that the enemy
      had about 1500 men behind these works. Our colors were first planted on the works,
      but some of the other regts were in almost as soon as we were &nbsp;After stopping a few
      moments, we again formed line and started in persuit of the enemy. The road was strewn [wi]th Knap s[ac]ks, blankets guns and coats that
      had been thrown away by the enemy in their retreat. After marching 3 or 4 miles we
      came to the shore and found the 9th N.Y. had got there before us, and had taken quite
      a number of prisoners and among the rest was the Son of Gov Wise, who was badly, and
      as it turned out fatally wounded.<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>As we came within sight of the shore we saw several vessels filled with rebel troops
      who had just escaped but they were far beyond rifle shot and were making there way
      across the Sound to a place called Nags Head. After resting here a short time we again
      started off through the woods, and after marching 3 or 4 miles more we came to a large
      place that had been clear[ed] of woods and filled with barracks built of boards, and
      logs and on which the rebs had expended a great deal of time and [labor?] &nbsp;On our
      arrival here we learned that all the forces on the Island had surrendered and we at
      once proceeded to take posession of the barracks and make ourselves comfortable. Next morning we found we had ful[l]
      posession of the Island (which the [rebs] seemed to have intended for a sort of depot for the
      collection of troops) and had taken some 35 Canon and near 2700 prisoners, &nbsp;the prisoners
      were mostly North Carolinaons but some, were from Georgia and Virginia &nbsp;The North Carolinoans and Georgians were regular buternuts, gaunt long haired and long leged chaps &nbsp;most of them dressed in Butternut clothing, but the Virginians wore a neat,
      grey uniform, and belonged to the Wise Legion<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>After takeing posession of the Island we settled quietly down and took things easy, until March 11th when
      we again went on board of Transports and left Roanoke and started back towards Hatteras
      Inlet. Arrived at Hatteras just before dark, and came to anchor. Early next morning
      we were under weigh again, and at night, we came to anchor in the Nuese river about 16 miles below Newbern. Early on the morning of the 13th the troops commenced
      to land at the mouth of a small stream called Slocums Creek, between 9 and 10 Oclock
      in the morning &nbsp;the last of the troops came on shore, and we took up the line of march
      towards Newbern. after marching along the ban[k] of the Neuse river 2 or 3 miles,
      we struck off through the woods and soon came upon what had been, a [farm house?]
      before, a rebel cavelry camp, passing along 4 or 5 miles further we came to quite an an extensive earthwork
      apparently just about finished, and as we heard, just evacuated by the rebs, &nbsp;pushing
      ahead we soon came to the railroad track and after tearing up a portion of the track
      we stacked arms and had a short rest
   </p>
   
   <p>We soon moved on again in three colums &nbsp;the first Brigade takeing a road running paralel with the railroad track and about ha[lf] a mile to the right of it, Our Brigade marching
      on the track, and the 3d brigade takeing a road left of us but the road on which the 3d Brigade were soon crossed the railroad
      and they fell in just behind us and were about to act as a reserve either to us or
      the 1st Brigade, whoever most needed their help. Just before dark we were ordered
      to file into the woods on the left of the railroad track and biouvack for the night &nbsp;The weather had been showery all the afternoon and continued so all
      night, part of the time raining pretty hard but I managed to get a little sleep as
      I was pretty tired. We were up at daylight in the morning and after haveing the men discharge and reload their peices we pushed on again, &nbsp;after marching 3 or 4 miles we heard [sharp firing?] just ahead
      of us, and we knew that our skirmishers were buisy with the enemy. The 1st Brigade first engaged the enemy whome they found posted in rifle pitts, that stretched from the river to the railroad (about ¾ of a Mile) while our Brigade
      made an attack on the entrenchments, on the left of the railroad and runing to a swamp, that it was impossible to get through. The fight on our side of the railroad,
      was kept up with much spirit, for about 4 hours when the fire from the rebel works
      began to slacken, [an]d we could see the greybacks leaving there works and runing through the woods, and soon their works were deserted by them, and occupied by us.
   </p>
   
   <p>In this battle we took about 100 prisoners and some 35 peices of canon. The Rebels retreated towards the Town of Newbern which is sepperated from the battle field by the Neuse river, &nbsp;ther[e] was a Railroad bridge across the
      river and this bridge the enemy entirely destroyed by fire after they had all crossed
   </p>
   
   <p>After getting posession of the rebel works our forces again formed in collums and followed up the retreat untill we came to the burning bridge, when we could go no further untill, an old fery boat (that had done good execution as a gunboat and belonged to the fleet) came up
      and carried across the First brigade, which took possession of the Town. The rebels
      had set fire to the Town in two or three places, but by the exertion of Soldiers and
      citazens only 12 or 15 houses was burned. Our Regt stoped for the night on the bank of the river and next morning we moved down to a lot of
      barracks that had been erected by the rebs and took posession of them. While the fight was going on between the land forces, our fleet was not
      idle but rendere[d] great service in silancei[ng] the shore batteries, which the rebs had erected with considerable skill along the
      river.
   </p>
   
   <p>After the fight was over, and we had a chance to look around, everyone was surprised
      at the extent and completeness of our victory, and to look at the preparations that
      had been made for the defense of the place, no one would have believed it could have
      been taken by the small force that Burnside had under his command &nbsp;The loss of our
      Regt was pretty heavy, (heavyer I believe than any other Regt engaged) and amounted to about 100 killed and wounded,
      including quite a number of office[r]s &nbsp;among which was Capt Johnson,<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> Lieut Allen,<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> Chaplain Benton,<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup> and Ordly Sergt Robert Smith killed &nbsp;Act Lieut Carrington was badly wounded and had
      his leg Amputated but it did not save his life and after great suffering he was sent
      home to New York and died the next day after arriving there &nbsp;Among the wounded was
      Lieut Col Potter,<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n12" id="r12">12</a></sup> shot through the side &nbsp;Major LeGendre<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n13" id="r13">13</a></sup> (rifle ball passed through his cheek and came out of the back of his neck below his
      coat collar) &nbsp;Just after the battle I found Major LeGendre on the battle field perfectly
      unable to move &nbsp;I took the blankets that I have strapped to my back, laid him on them,
      and got some men and had him carried to the rear where the Surgeon was at work. Lieuts
      Tryon<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n14" id="r14">14</a></sup> and McKee<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n15" id="r15">15</a></sup> were also badly wounded in this fight.<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n16" id="r16">16</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>In the course of a few days our Regt moved across the river and encamped and preparations
      were at once made, to receive the enemy, should they think worth while to come and
      try to regain posession of the place, &nbsp;Large earthworks was constructed, woods cut
      down so that the Gunboats would have a chance to work, but with the exception of squads
      of cavelry that somewhat annoyed our Pickets the enemy kept very quiet and we were not disturbed
      &nbsp;On the morning of July 2d 1862 our Brigade went on board Transports and sailed from
      Newbern as we were supposed to reinforce McClellan<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n17" id="r17">17</a></sup> who was there fighting on the Peninsular, &nbsp;After reaching Hatteras Inlet on the morning
      of the 3d news came to us (from some quarter) that McClellan was in posession of Richmond and we were ordered back to Newbern where we arived on the same evening and went back to our old camping ground, but on the 5th we again
      went on board of Transports (it haveing been found out that McClellands being in Richmond was a hoax) and off we started
      again,<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n18" id="r18">18</a></sup> &nbsp;On our arrival at Fortress Monroe we found the fighting on the Peninsular was over
      as McClellan had been obliged to fall back to the James River under the protection
      of his Gunboats, and we were ordered to Newport News where we went into camp and stopped
      until August 2d when we struck camp and went on board Transports again. We sailed
      down past Fortress Monroe and entered the Mouth of the Potomac River on the afternoon
      of Aug 3d. Proceeding up the Potomac we arrived and landed at Aquia Creek on the evening
      of the 4th and at once went on board the cars and started for Falmouth where we arrived
      about 9 Oclock P.M. and bivouaced for the night in a field near the Lacy House. Next morning we pitched camp and took
      things easy. Here we found the 14th Regt of Brooklyn<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n19" id="r19">19</a></sup> among which I met many friends, among the best George Davy.<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n20" id="r20">20</a></sup> &nbsp;August 11th We received orders to march next day. So about 7 Oclock in the afternoon
      of the 12th we started over a terrible muddy rocky road and kept marching untill 4 Oclock on the morning of the 13th when we turned off in the fields and had a few
      hours sleep. Started again at 8 O clock A.M. and marched untill 8 O clock P.M. (only stopping 1 hour for dinner) when we bivouaced for the night &nbsp;Started at 6 Oclock next morning, and about 9½ Oclock A.M. arrived
      at Bealton Station on Orange &amp; Alexandria R.R. where we took cars for Culpepper. Arrived
      at Culpepper Station in the afternoon &nbsp;marched a couple of miles and bivouaced &nbsp;rained all night.
   </p>
   
   <p>Aug 15th marched about 7 miles and bivouaced at the foot of the Mountains at a place called Cedar Run. There was said to be a
      large rebel force lying jus the other side of the Mountains, and I think Gen Reno, who had command of us at this
      time (Gen Burnside &nbsp;haveing been left in command of Fredericksburg) though it wouldent be healthy for us to stay
      there any longer, so on the evening of the 18th after building camp fires to deceive
      the enemy we quietly formed the Regt in line of battle and lay down untill about 1½ Oclock on the morning of the 19th when we were ordered to move
   </p>
   
   <p>We pushed ahead only stopping occasionaly for a few moments rest untill Noon when we halted for a couple of hours, when we moved on again and reached and
      forded the Rappahanock River a[t] a place called Keleys Ford and bivouaced, all pretty well played out with our long and rapid march. It was supposed there
      was a large rebel force under Jackson<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n21" id="r21">21</a></sup> that was makeing for the crossing at Keleys Ford to cut us off, which was the reason of our hurried
      march.
   </p>
   
   <p>August 21st &nbsp;Rebel Cavelry showed themselves on the opposite side of the river in considerable force and seemed
      to be feeling for a crossing. Soon some of our Cavelry went over and had quite a lively skirmish with them and finaly dispense[d] them and drove them away, &nbsp;our Regt was on Picket duty along the bank
      of the river so that we had a good sight at the cavelry Scrimmage.
   </p>
   
   <p>Aug 22d &nbsp;our Regt and a Battery of Artillery took a position to dispute the enemys crossing the river, the rest of the Brigade mooving somewhere further up the river. Col Potters orders were to hold the Ford while we
      had a man left. and well we knew he would obey the order. During the day several prisoners
      were brought in, by our Cavelry, who reported the enemy moveing away. During the night a good watch was kept &nbsp;the Regt sleeping on their arms, but
      no enemy appea[r]ed and at 8 Oclock on [the] morning of the 23d we [left] Keleys Ford
      and started towards Rappahanock Station and joined the rest of our Brigade &nbsp;we passed
      the station and marched through the mud and rain untill 6 O clock P.M. when we halted for a few hours to give the men a chance to rest and
      make coffe &nbsp;Started again at 9 P.M. and after going 3 or 4 mil[es] halted and ha[d] a [ &nbsp; ]
      &nbsp;Aug 24th &nbsp;[started?] at 2 O clock A.M. &nbsp;reached sulphur Springs about dark and bivouaced. Aug 25 &nbsp;left Sulphur Springs at 4 Oclock A.M. and went into Warrenton halted near
      the Villiage and began to make coffee, &nbsp;just as the boys got their fires started the order was
      given to fall in lively. We fell in line at once and moved about ½ a mile an formed
      in double collumn at ha[lf] distance, &nbsp;expected from the movements that we were going to have a fight
      sure, but no enemy appearing we took up the line of march just before dark, towards
      Warrenton Junction &nbsp;After a very heavy march over awful muddy roads came to within
      3 miles of Warrenton Station and it being almost morning we bivouaced
   </p>
   
   <p>Aug 26th &nbsp;marched to Warrenton Station and bivouaced, &nbsp;Aug 27th &nbsp;left camp at 8 A.M. &nbsp;marched 3 miles back towards Warrenton on the same
      road that we came the day before, when an aid rode up to the Col with dispatches,
      and we were ordered to bout face and march back again, when we took the road towards
      Monassas junction, &nbsp;about 12 O clock M we turned off the road and march[ed] behind
      a wood and formed in line of battle and lay for about 3 hours, and then started on,
      to Gainsville and bivouaced, Aug 2[8th?] &nbsp;left at 5 A.M. &nbsp;marched along the R.R. and reache[d] Mannassas Junction
      about 11 A.M. &nbsp;found the enemy had been there the night before and burned the Depot,
      torn up the track, captured and burned 2 trains of cars &nbsp;took quite a number of prisoners
      who were guarding the Depot, and raised the devil generaly &nbsp;Stoped there 3 or 4 hours and started on in the direction the rebs had taken, bivouaced in a field at 8 P.M.

   <p>Aug 29th &nbsp;Started at 5 A M &nbsp;arrived on the Bull Run battle field, found the fight
      going on &nbsp;rested a short time and then unslung knapsacks and went up to the front,
      were ordered to support a Battery that was planted on a hill, and engaged Shelling
      the wood were the enemy were concealed, lay there until just about dusk, when we were
      ordered down to the edge of the wood were we lay in line of battle until dayligh &nbsp;Next morning when we went back to support the battery. Considerable fighting had
      been going on all the day before but all the morning of Aug 30th there did not seem
      to be any very heavy fireing untill along in the afternoon when a very heavy Collumn of the enemy made an attack on the left of our line (where McDowell's<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n22" id="r22">22</a></sup> troops were posted) forced our line back, and were in a fair way to capture our Artillery
      and baggage train, and our Brigade were ordered to go and try and check his advance
      &nbsp;We started off on the double quick &nbsp;went about a mile through fields and as the enemy
      were advancing up through [ &nbsp; ] of woods which perfectly concealed them, we advanced
      to within 200 feet of the enemy before we knew where they were &nbsp;all at once the enemy
      poured a volley into us, doing terrible execution and throwing the left of our regt
      into momentary confusion &nbsp;in a moment however the men rallied and we formed line of
      battle and the way we poured the pills into them fellows was a caution &nbsp;our men fought
      like devils and the enemy soon fell back but they came back again when we had another
      Short, sharp fight, when the enemy again fell back and we advanced a short distance
      and waited for them to come on again if they felt disposed, &nbsp;we staid there untill about 10 O clock P.M. when we quietly marched off the feild in Collumn of companies and I had no idea that we were retreating untill we got out on the road and found that we had been holding the enemy in check untill our Artilery and baggage train could get away &nbsp;we marched untill daylight on the morning of the 31st when we arrived at Centerville and bivouaced, &nbsp;we found the loss of our Regt was 60 and the company that I was in lost 13 men
      out of 30 that we took into action. &nbsp;Sept 1st &nbsp;Left at 5 A.M. &nbsp;marched about 2 miles
      to a place where we were told we would stay for a couple of weeks, &nbsp;we went to work
      and put up our tents and thought we were going to have a good rest, but about 4 O
      clock P.M. word came for us to fall in in a hurry and started in the direction of
      Fairfax Court house, &nbsp;after going about 2 miles we found quite a sharp fight going
      on. It seems that a strong force of the enemy had passed through the coun[try?] to
      the left of us, utnill they got between us and Alexandria when they made there appearance on the road [on?]
      which our Artillery and trains were retreating with the evident intention of cutting
      them off and destroying them. As soon as our regt arrived on the ground we were ordered
      into a thick peice of woods were the enemy were supposed to be in considerable force, &nbsp;We forwarded
      in line of battle driving out the enemys skirmishers and sharpshooters. Soon after we entered the woods it began to rain very
      hard and as the woods [was] very thick we could [hear?] the enemy, snapping caps at
      us, seemingly not more than [100?] feet off &nbsp;yet we could not see them. after thourily cleaning the woods of the enemys skirmishers we were ordered out of the woods, as the enem[y] had fell back, pretty
      severly punished, and after waiting until our trains had all passed we started on towards
      Fairfax Court House &nbsp;the loss of our regt in this fight (which was the battle of Chantilla)
      was 10 wounded, but the 21st Massachusetts who were in our Brigade and who had stood
      side by side with our regt in every battle ever since we had been in the feild, were terribly cut up, &nbsp;General's Kearny and Stephens were killed in this fight.<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n23" id="r23">23</a></sup>

   <p>Sept 2d &nbsp;encamped in the afternoon in a feild 21 miles from Alexandria, where we staid until about 8 O clock P M Sept 4th when
      we started for Washington &nbsp;marched through Alexandria &nbsp;crossed the long Bridge and
      arrived in Washington just before daylight on the morning of Sept 5th and bivouaced at a place called park garden in 7th street where we staid untill the morning of the 7th when we marched to Leesboro Md and bivouac[ed] staid here
      untill the morning of the 9th when [ &nbsp; &nbsp;] &nbsp;commission as [1st] Lieut from to day &nbsp;Sept 10th
      &nbsp;we marched to Brookville and bivouaced &nbsp;Sept 11th &nbsp;left Brookville and went to Damascu &nbsp;passed through the villiages of Monrovia, Unity, New Market, and bivouaced near Frederick City. &nbsp;Sept 13th &nbsp;Started at 4 P.M. &nbsp;passed through Frederick City
      and bivouaced at Middletown about 4 P.M. &nbsp;Sept 14 &nbsp;started about 10 A.M. [ &nbsp; ] marched about [
      &nbsp; ] arrived up [ &nbsp; &nbsp;] the front about 5 O clock P.M. &nbsp;found the enemy posted in a
      very strong position on a range of steep hills called South Mountains. [ &nbsp; ] Division
      of our Corps were sent way down to our left, and [turned?] the enemys right flank [ &nbsp; ] but we had only been there a few moments when an aid from Gen Burnside
      rode up to Gen Reno and told him to look out for a strong collumn of the enemy who were advancing through a sort of a [ &nbsp; ] to get possession [ &nbsp; ]
      who were concealed on a peice of woods just in advance of us. We were ordered to lay down and not [fire?] a shot
      untill the enemy advanced out of the woods so that we could get a good chance at them and
      there we lay for about half an hour &nbsp;the enemy blazing away at us but doing very little
      damage as the balls passed over us and as it was certain that the enemy were determined
      not to come out of the woods we were ordered to rise up and commence fireing which we did in such good earnest that the rebel fire quickly began to [ &nbsp; ] and
      [ &nbsp; ] that the enemy skedaddled during the night. The loss of our Regt in [Thursdays?]
      [ &nbsp; ] (called the battle of South Mountain) was about [15?] killed and wounded &nbsp;Gen
      Reno who had command of our [ &nbsp; ]<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n24" id="r24">24</a></sup> I took a walk over [a?] part of the battle feild and I never saw such sights [ &nbsp; ] to be seen [ &nbsp; ] &nbsp;in some parts of the feild the ground was [ &nbsp; ] covered with dead rebels [ &nbsp; ]
   </p>
   
   <p>Sept 15th &nbsp;Started about 10 A.M. and march[ed] about 7 miles on the Sharpsburg road
      towards which the rebs had retreated &nbsp;Sept 16th &nbsp;Artillery fireing in advance, showing that the enemy were going to make another stand &nbsp;Marched about
      3 miles and bivouaced there &nbsp;Enemys shells flying over us pretty lively &nbsp;Sept 17th &nbsp;fell in about 6 Oclock A.M. and waited
      for orders. The fight had been going [on?] since early in the morning and seemed to
      be very heavy on the right of us, where Hooker<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n25" id="r25">25</a></sup> was engaged, &nbsp;about 9 A.M. our Division was ordered to take a bridge which crossed
      Antietam creek and which w[as] defended by temporar[y] breastworks. The enemy had
      a very great advantage over us, as the bank on their side of the creek was very high
      and very steep. Our first Brigade was sent down to make the attack, and our Brigade
      was ordered to support them, but the first Brigade did not seem to get along very
      well, as they rather held back, and did not seem inclined to cross an open feild that had to be crossed before they could reach the Bridge and our Brigade was ordered
      to advance and see what we could do. We advanced on a double quick under heavy fire
      from the enemy, from which we suffered considerably, passed by the first Brigade,
      and formed close down to the edge of the creek &nbsp;the 51st Pennsylvania forming just
      above the bridge and our Regt just below, &nbsp;after fighting here about 2 hours the order
      was given to charge and away we went, &nbsp;the 51st Penn haveing just about as far to go as we had, we both reached the bridge and crossed at the
      same time, as soon as we commenced the [charge?] the enemy commenced to leave. the
      enemy had a battery posted just up on the hill but when we charged &nbsp;the battery skedaddled
      and the whole rebel force fell back about ½ a mile where they were protected by stone
      fences, and here they made another stand &nbsp;Our third Brigade had been sent way down
      to the left to cross the creek and make an attack on the enemys flank but after a splendid charge on a rebel battery they were badly repulsed and
      fell back in considerable disorder, &nbsp;after we had crossed the bridge and got possession
      of the heights we formed in a road and waited for orders and as soon as the 3d Brigade
      was driven back we were ordered to advance &nbsp;we forwarded up to within 500 yards of
      where the rebels were concealed when we halted and commenced fireing but as our ammunition had nearly all be expended in the morning at the bridge (and
      there was not more to be had just at that time) we were soon out of ammunition and
      had to lay down and let the enemy blaze away at us while we hadent a shot to give them in return. We hunted all around and took all the cartridges out
      of the boxes of the killed and wounded and then we had to lay quiet &nbsp;the rebels seemed
      to be very much puzled to why we kept so still &nbsp;they seemed to think we were trying to get them into some
      kind of a trap, as they did not advance at all but kept up a pretty severe fire which
      of course we had to lay and take for about an hour when another brigade was sent in
      to relieve us and we were ordered back to the road where we were protected by a hill
      and after getting a fresh suply of ammunition we lay down and slept untill morning. Sept 18th &nbsp;Slight Skirmishing going on all day, but we were not called on
      although we lay in line of battle and ready to advance at any moment if we had been
      called on. About 4 P.M. another Brigade came across the bridge and relieved us, and
      we fell back across the creek and bivouaced. The loss of our Regt. in this battle (of Antietam) was about 100 men killed and
      wounded. Sept 19th &nbsp;Found the enemy had skedaddled during the previous night and about
      9 O clock A.M. we were ordered to fall in, when we recrossed the bridge &nbsp;passed over
      a part of the battle field, found quite a large number of dead rebels, went about
      2 miles, no signs of the enemy, so we bivouac[ed] Sept 20th &nbsp;put up Shelter tents
      and made ourselves as comfortable as possible untill Sept 26th when we changed our camp to the opposite side of Antietam creek,<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n26" id="r26">26</a></sup>

      in camp &nbsp;grub mighty scarce, awful poor country but boys managed to steal a chicken
      now and then<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n27" id="r27">27</a></sup> &nbsp;Nov 11th &nbsp;A few rebels showed themselves in front of our Pickets so our Regt. and
      2 peices of Durrells<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n28" id="r28">28</a></sup> battery were sen[t] on a reconnoitering expedition, went out a couple of miles &nbsp;couldent find the rebs in any force, battery sent a few shells into the woods, and we came
      back to camp, &nbsp;Nov 12th &nbsp;was woke up about 12 O clock at night and ordered to strike
      quietly and get ready to march, &nbsp;the enemy were supposed to be in strong force within
      10 miles of us and it seems they just began to find out that we were weak in numbers
      as our Division [w]ere the only troops across the river, and our other Brigade was
      way off to the right of us some 6 or 8 miles. &nbsp;We started about 3 Oclock A.M. (leaving
      a Cavelry Picket with orders to stay until driven away by the enemy) and fell back
      across the Rappahanock river to Sulphur Springs and bivouaced &nbsp;Nov 13th &nbsp;The enemy<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n29" id="r29">29</a></sup> drove in the pickets that we left at Jefferson and followed them almost to the bank
      of the river when our batteries opened on them, which made them [right?] about and
      leave in a hurry &nbsp;rations of crackers and coffee and sugar served out to day &nbsp;the
      first we had for five days. &nbsp;Nov 15th &nbsp;Left camp at 7 A.M. Infantry takeing the lead, Artillery following, and baggage train bringing up the rear, &nbsp;we took a
      road runing near the bank of the river and as soon as our Infantry and Artillery had all passed,
      a force of rebel cavelry and Artillery made their appearance on the opposite side of the river and commenced
      Shelling our baggage train &nbsp;a couple of our batteries were ordered back to engage
      the rebs and our Regt were ordered to support them, &nbsp;we went back and our batteries
      took posish but as our guns were only 12 pounders while the rebs had 20 pounders of course they
      had altogather the best of the fighting and threw shot and shell among us pretty lively while our
      guns couldent reach them. Our Regt. lay just behind our batteries, but were protected by a hill
      so that they could not do us much damage although they threw shell over us and all
      around us &nbsp;After laying there about 2 hours our First Division came along with [Ben?]jamins
      Battery of 20 pounders, who ran up on the hill &nbsp;took position, opened fire, and soon
      made the rebs get up and get, and we went on 4 or 5 miles and bivouaced. &nbsp;Nov 16th &nbsp;Left camp at 7 A.M. passed through Fayettville and bivouaced &nbsp;Nov 17th &nbsp;Started in the morning &nbsp;marched all day and bivouaced &nbsp;Nov. 18th &nbsp;lay in camp &nbsp;Nov 19th &nbsp;Marched to [Fal]mouth and encamped [at?] the Lacy
      House &nbsp;[Here?] we lay untill Nov 22 [whe]n we moved camp to the Bell Plains road where we lay untill Dec 10th when we Recd orders to keep 5 days cooked rations on hand and be ready to
      move at an hours notice, tents to be left standing &nbsp;Dec 11th &nbsp;Was woke up about 4
      Oclock in the morning, by the most terrible Artillery fireing I had ever heard, &nbsp;the Regt fell in about 7 A.M. and marched down to [the] Lacy House
      where [we] lay all day &nbsp;heavy [ &nbsp; ] fireing all day, &nbsp;the [ &nbsp; ] had been trying all day to lay the Pontoon Bridge but the enemys fire had been so hot that up to 4 P M the bridge was unfinished &nbsp;about 4½ P.[M.]
      our Brigade was ordered back to camp but when we were about half way, orders came
      for our Regt. to go down and assist in laying the bridge (I heard one [of] Gen Burnsides
      Aides [say?] that, one of the officers [of the] Engineer Regt, that [was] engaged
      in laying the bridge came to Burnside [an]d said that the fire [of] the enemy was
      so hot that [it] was impossible for his [m]en to work, &nbsp;The aid said that Burnside
      turned to one of his officers and told him to send for the 51st N. Y. and let them
      finish it) but before we reached the river word came that the bridge was finished
      and we were ordered back to camp &nbsp;pa[rt of] our forces crossed [the] river during
      the [ &nbsp; ] &nbsp;Dec. 12th &nbsp;Fell in and [went] over the Pontoons [to] Fredericksburg, halt[ed]
      [ &nbsp; ] the bank of the river &nbsp;stacked arms and [ &nbsp; ] all day and night [ &nbsp; ] enemy
      throwing shell over our heads when ever they saw any one comeing across the river. &nbsp;Dec 13th &nbsp;Fell in about 8 A.M. and went to the back part of the
      City where we halted about an hour waiting for orders when the rest of our Brigade
      was sent up to the front and our Regt, was ordered to support a battery which took
      position on a small hill about 500 from the enemys works, &nbsp;the enemy completely swept the position with grape and cannister and our
      battery was soon obliged to haul off with nearly half of their men either killed or
      wounded, &nbsp;Our Regt was then ordered up to the front line of battle, and went in by
      the flank untill we were about opposite the position we were to occupy when we forwarded in line of
      battle over a plain about 200 Yards wide that was entirely swept by the enemys guns and we received the most terrific fire of grape, cannister, percussion Shell
      musketry and everything else, that I ever saw. The Regt strugled on to the front, and opened fire and kept it up untill they expended their 60 rounds of ammunition, and there we laid down, as fresh troops
      came in and releived us, but as it was getting late in the afternoon it was thought best to leave the
      regt where it was untill dark as it was much safer there, than passing over the open feild again (in daylight) to go out as we were somewhat protected by a rise in the ground
      while we staid there. As soon as it was dark we went back to our old place by the
      bank of the river, and bivouaced &nbsp;We found that our loss was 63 men killed and wounded and 6 officers wounded &nbsp;I was
      hit by a peice of shell which struck me in the face cutting through my cheek but doing no serious
      damage<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n30" id="r30">30</a></sup> &nbsp;Dec 14th &nbsp;Some skirmishing going on in front, but no serious fighting &nbsp;About 10
      Oclock P.M. we fell in and went out to the front on picket &nbsp;we were in almost the
      same spot where we were fighting the day before &nbsp;had two or three alarms during the
      night and there was some fireing but no harm done on our side. &nbsp;Dec 15th &nbsp;Spent a most miserable day &nbsp;we were laying
      in a place where the ground just protected us from the enemys shot if we lay down flat, but if we raised our heads the least bit, the enemy, who
      were behind the rifle pitts would blaze away at us and we could hear the bullets whiz
      all around us. it was devilish aggrevating to a fellow to be obliged to lay there flat on the ground and hear the rebs moveing about behind their works talking and whistling and apparently enjoying themselves
      first rate, &nbsp;during the afternoon they amused themselves by fireing at us with Artillery, first they tried a solid shot, that just skimed the ground in front of us, and passed a few inches over our heads, next they tried
      a percussion shell but they could not depress their guns enough and the shell struck
      and exploded just to the rear of us &nbsp;they next fired a fuse shell but they dare not
      cut the fuse short enough (for fear the shell would explode in the gun) and it passed
      over our heads doing no damage, &nbsp;finaly they tried a charge of grape but were just as unsuccessful as they were in their
      other kind efforts, and they gave it up in despair. We lay there untill about 12 Oclock at night when we fell back crossed the pontoon bridge and went back
      to our old camp on the Bell Plains road, &nbsp;During the night all the troops retreated
      across the river to the Falmouth side, bringing all their Artillery and Baggage, and
      so ended the great battle of Fredericksburg which was lost in my Opinion soley throug incompetant Generalship &nbsp;for I am certain, never did men fight harder or better.<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n31" id="r31">31</a></sup> &nbsp;Dec 16th &nbsp;fixed up our old camp and took things quietly &nbsp;the whole regt going on

      at Cincinnatti Ohio about 8 P.M. &nbsp;had a fine supper in the Market home furnished by the citazens, Staid there in the street untill about 12 Oclock at night (as no one seemd to have a very clear idea where we were to go or what was to be done with us) and
      then marched down to the Ferry and went on board the boat, and crossed the Ohio river
      to Covington Ky, marched to the Car Depot &nbsp;took posession of a train of cars and went to sleep &nbsp;March 31st &nbsp;turned out about daylight &nbsp;went
      to a Hotel and had some breakfast, left Covington about 4 P.M. by the Kentucky Central
      R.R. Staid in the cars all night and in the morning we found ourselves at a place
      called Paris,<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n35" id="r35">35</a></sup> where we left the cars, marched about a mile and pitched our tents, as we were told
      we were to stay here, but on the evening of April 2d we were ordered to be ready to
      march early the next morning &nbsp;April 3d &nbsp;struck tents and started about 8 A.M. &nbsp;passed
      through the Villiage of Middletown and bivouaced about ½ a mile from the Villiage of Mt. Sterling about 7 P.M. haveing marched 22 miles to day. &nbsp;April 4th &nbsp;Marched through the town and encamped about
      a mile on the other side of it, where we staid doing picket duty until April 14th
      when we had a little excitement in the shape of rapid marching. As I was sitting in
      my tent writing (about 12 O clock at night) I heard one of Gen Ferreros staff ride
      into camp and give the Col. orders to have his men ready to move, with one days rations
      and in light marching order in an hours time. In five minutes all was bustle in the
      camp and about 1 A.M. on the morning of the 15th we fell in and started &nbsp;after going
      a short distance we were joined by the 51st Penn so that we were all right for anything
      that might turn up. No one knew where we were going, but we all surmised that we were
      on a hunt after Guerrilas, a kind of animal that we were all curious to see, &nbsp;we had a native guide to conduct
      us and just about daylight we halted to rest a few moments just outside the Villiage [of] Sharpsburg, as we had marched about 12 in 4 hours, &nbsp;After resting a moment,
      we started on again &nbsp;throwing out a company of skirmishers and after we reached the
      Town, our Regt. went along the outskirts on one side, and the 51st Penn on the other,
      leav[ing] pickets every 200 feet until we met in the rear of the town, so that when
      the citazen[s] woke up in the morning they found the place completely surrounded but
      nary Guerilla could we find in the place. We arrested quite a number of citazens, who were noted secessionists, &nbsp;all those that [were] willing to take the [oath]
      of aleagance we [ &nbsp; ] but several who [refu]sed we brought away [an]d I believe they were sent
      to Cincinnatti, to Gen Brunsides Head Quarters. About 5 P.M. we started back to camp where we arrived
      about 9 P.M. pretty well tired out, It seems that from some information they received
      the Union people of Sharpsburg supposed that the rebel Guerillas were about to make
      a [raid] on the town (duri[ng] the night of our visit) a[s they] had done several
      ti[mes] before. April 17th &nbsp;left Mt. Sterling about 4 A.M. and marched 15 miles and
      encampe[d] near Winchester Ky &nbsp;April 18th &nbsp;Received our pay for the months of Nov,
      Dec, Jan &amp; Feb &nbsp;April 19th &nbsp;Receiv[e]d notice from Col. LeGendre that it was the wish
      of the men that I wou[ld] take the money (that they wished to send home) to Lexington
      and Express it for them, &nbsp;April 20th and 21st &nbsp;I was kept buisy receiving the mens money and takeing the directions of the persons they wanted it sent to &nbsp;April 22d &nbsp;I started about
      5 p.m. on horseback, with about 11000 dollars &nbsp;went as far as the villiage, sent the horse back to camp &nbsp;stopped at the Hotel all night and about 7 A.M. on
      the 23d I took the stage for Lexington &nbsp;after riding about 18 miles reached Lexingto[n]
      went straight to the Office of the Addams Express Co had my money put in the safe
      &nbsp;got a receipt for it and then went to a hotel and got dinner, then went back to the
      Express Office and commenced putting the money up in packages. found it was going
      to be a pretty heavy job as the money had all to be put up in packages of from 10
      to 50 dollars, directed and receipts taken for each seperate package &nbsp;I had a clerk to help me and we both worked hard untill dark, when I went to the Broadway Hotel, had supper, went to the Theater (a one horse
      affair) came back and went to <em>bed</em> &nbsp;April 24th &nbsp;After breakfast went to the express Office and went to work, worked
      until 1 O clock, then went and had dinner and then went back to the Office and worked
      untill night, &nbsp;after tea took a short walk about the City and came back and went to bed,
      &nbsp;April 25th &nbsp;went to the Office again and finished putting up the money. Straitened
      up my receipts &nbsp;found the money all came out right to a cent, took a walk about the
      City &nbsp;was quite surprised to see it so much larger than I expected, liked the place
      first rate, bought a few things that I wante[d] &nbsp;went back to the hotel &nbsp;had dinner
      and about 2 P.M. took the stage back for Winchester &nbsp;the farms along the roads were
      the finest I have ever seen, and the crops looked splendid &nbsp;in a great many fields

      and we were ordered to Strike tents and get ready to move at once, &nbsp;We pulled down
      our tents &nbsp;loaded everything on the wagons, and then the regt. fell in &nbsp;marched about
      a mile, lay down on the road and slept untill daylight and then marched back and put up our tents again and staid there doing Provost

      we were overtaken by a large train of Army wagons that were going to Nicholasville

      started on, &nbsp;June 13th &nbsp;Stopped an hour at Millikens Bend where we saw quite a number
      of Niger Regts encamped. &nbsp;June 14th &nbsp;Arived and went on shore at Shermans Landing,
      Louisana (about 4 miles below Vicksburg.) &nbsp;could see the Mortar Boats blazing away at the
      City &nbsp;it was a splendid sight at night as you could see the shells from the time they
      left the boats untill they exploded. &nbsp;June 15th &nbsp;Left at 5 A.M. marching about 3 miles (across the narrow
      neck of land where the great Canal that was to leave Vicksburg an inland town had
      been attempted<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n40" id="r40">40</a></sup>) untill we struck the river below Vicksburg, went on board the boat &nbsp;crossed the Mississippi
      river landing at Warrenton Miss, about 3 miles from Vicksburg &nbsp;had a sight of the
      city as we were crossing the river &nbsp;Staid at Warrenton about 2 hours when we were

      Sailed up the Yazoo river about 14 miles and landed at Snyders Bluff, Miss. &nbsp;June
      17th &nbsp;Went on shore &nbsp;marched about 2 miles and encamped, heard Artillery fireing constantly at Vicksburg, Sometimes very heavy, &nbsp;Our Camp was situated about 8 miles
      in the rear of Vicksburg, and between the Yazoo and black rivers. Our whole Corps
      encamped about here and immediately went to work fortifying and getting ready to receive
      Johnson (if he should attempt to make his threat good of raising the Seige of Vicksburg<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n41" id="r41">41</a></sup>). We dug miles of rifle pitts, cut down a great deal of timber &nbsp;made breastworks
      and Redouts for Artillery, and fixed things in such a shape that had Johnson dared
      to attack us I feel confident we would have either killed or captured his whole force.
   </p>
   
   <p>June 18th to July 4th &nbsp;heard heavy fireing at Vicksburg every day and sometimes all night. Nearly every day we had all sorts
      of rumers about the Rebel Gen Johnson, &nbsp;sometimes we heard that he had crossed the
      Black River with 40 or 50,000 men and was marching to attack us, and then again he
      was collecting a terrible force at Jackson, and was soon comeing down here to eat us all up but we paid no attention to these stories but kept steady
      at our work and minded our own buisness &nbsp;July 4th &nbsp;Got the news of the surrender of Vicksburg and about 12 M received orders
      to be ready to march a 4 P.M. with 10 days rations &nbsp;3 days to be carried in haversacks
      and 7 in wagons.
   </p>
   
   <p>Started at 6 P.M. &nbsp;marched about 7 miles and bivouaced &nbsp;Weather terrible hot and roads awful dusty &nbsp;July 5th &nbsp;Marched about 10 miles and
      bivouaced within a couple of miles of the Big Black River. Dust horrible and weather hot. &nbsp;July
      [6th?] &nbsp;Laid in camp all day waiting for the pioneers to build a bridge across the
      river as it was found to be to deep to ford, as we had intended the rebel pickets
      who were posted on the opposite side of the Big Black river (a small muddy creek about
      150 ft wide) &nbsp;fell back as soon as our forces came in sight. &nbsp;July 7th &nbsp;Started about
      2 P.M. &nbsp;crossed the river weather very hot. Several men sun struck and two or three
      died from the effects of the heat &nbsp;men suffered considerably from the scarcity of
      water, about 8 P.M. had a terrible thunder Shower &nbsp;never saw such sharp lightning
      almost blinded a fellow &nbsp;it was so dark you could not see an inch before you and we
      had to halt in the road, and stand and take the whole of it. About 9 P.M. it stopped
      raining, but the dust that had laid in the road like flour 4 or 5 inches deep was
      now made into mortar and we strugled on for a mile or two and then had to give it up, and turned off by the side of the
      road and bivouaced &nbsp;we were all soaked through and through so we built a fire and dried up a little
      and then sat down on the ground and went to sleep. &nbsp;July 8th &nbsp;Left in the afternoon
      and marched untill 3 Oclock on the morning of the 9th &nbsp;was on the road nearly all day but the weather
      was so hot we could not get along much.
   </p>
   
   <p>July 10th &nbsp;marched nearly all day &nbsp;heard Artillery fireing ahead, &nbsp;arrived within sight of Jackson (where we supposed we were going to have
      a big fight with Johnson) about 4 P.M. and halted untill about 6 Oclock P.M when we went up to the front and took position and lay down in
      line of battle and slept, all night. &nbsp;July 11th &nbsp;went up to support skirmishers &nbsp;changed
      our position about 1 P.M. went to the extreme left of our line, &nbsp;my Co and 3 others
      were deployed as skirmishers &nbsp;we forwarded about 500 yards untill we were on a line of the other regts and then halted, and kept a bright look out
      for the rebs but as we were in a wood we could not see the enemy although the bullets
      flew around quite lively, &nbsp;had quite a shower just before night, got wet through &nbsp;had
      nothing to eat since early in the morning but for my supper I borrowed a cracker,
      and made believe I had a good supper, although the prospect was not very fair for
      passing a comfortable night as I was wet to the skin &nbsp;tired hungry and on picket,
      in the woods and the night was so dark you couldent see an inch from your nose, &nbsp;we had one man wounded to day. &nbsp;July 12th &nbsp;My Co was
      releived at 8 A.M. and were to act as a reserve for the other skirmishers &nbsp;that is we fell
      back about 100 yards to a place where we were protected by a high bank but we had
      to keep all our equipments on and be ready to assist our skirmishers if they were
      hard pressed. Our batteries worked pretty for a while to day &nbsp;July 13th &nbsp;Our Regt
      was releived at daylight by the 9th New Hampshire and our whole regt was held in reserve, &nbsp;we
      had several alarms during the day and two or three times at night we had to fall in,
      when the fireing was heavy. &nbsp;July 14th &nbsp;our regt was releived this morning and we marched about a mile to the rear and encamped. &nbsp;July 15th &nbsp;Went
      down to a pond &nbsp;took off my clothes &nbsp;washed them &nbsp;wrung them out and put them on to
      day. When we left camp we only took the clothes we had on us &nbsp;every thing else had
      to be left in camp. &nbsp;July 16th &nbsp;Our regt. went up to the front again at 2 Oclock this
      morning, takeing our old position &nbsp;heard the sound of heavy wagon trains during the night and made
      up my mind the enemy were either skedaddling or moveing Artillery down to the right of their line (in front of us) I couldent tell which) &nbsp;July 17th &nbsp;About 2 Oclock in the morning our regt was ordered to change
      their position and we moved about ¾ of a mile to the right and were ordered to support
      the 35th Mass. who belonged to our brigade and were posted in rifle pitts that they had dug during two or three nights they had been there. Just about daylight
      a white flag was hoisted on the rebel breastworks (as we afterwards found by the citazens) and we found that the enemy had all left during the night and we marched in and
      took posession of the Town. &nbsp;The 35th Mass, being the first and our regt being the second inside
      the rebel works<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n42" id="r42">42</a></sup> &nbsp;quite a number of houses were on fire (supposed to have been set on fire by our
      Shells) and the place looked pretty hard, for the Capitol of a state, &nbsp;still you could
      see that it had been a very handsome place, &nbsp;The state buildings were standing but
      they looked as if they had seen hard times lately. Most all of the houses were deserted
      and closed and although we put guards on a good many of the houses, the place was
      completely ransacked as soon as the western troops came in there. &nbsp;We took 2 or 300
      prisoners and found that the rebs had left (in their hury to get away) quite a number of rifles &nbsp;a large amount of ammunition and 2 seige guns,
      &nbsp;about 4 P.M. the 16th Corps took posession of the town and we marched back to our old place and bivouaced.

   <p>July 20th &nbsp;Started at 6 A.M. for our old camp at Milldale &nbsp;passed through Clinton
      and halted for 3 or 4 hours and then started and went 5 or 6 miles more and bivouaced &nbsp;Marched to day about 16 miles &nbsp;July 21st &nbsp;Started at 4 A.M. &nbsp;passed through Brownsville.

      all standing just as we left them, had a good wash &nbsp;changed my clothes, and took things
      comfortably as we were all completely tired out, and I made up my mind that takeing into consideration the hot weather that since we left camp on the 4th of July it
      had been about as hard a 19 days as I had seen since I had been in the Army<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n43" id="r43">43</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00487_n100">1. From sometime in September
      1861 until September 6, 1863, George Whitman recorded his war experiences in a
      pocket diary. &nbsp;After he was captured on September 30, 1864, the diary was among
      the contents of a trunk sent on to his mother's home in Brooklyn, where it
      arrived on December 26, 1864. Walt Whitman read the diary and recorded the
      following thoughts in his own diary for that day:"It is merely a skeleton of dates, voyages, places camped in or
      marched through, battles fought, &amp;c. But I can realize clearly that by
      calling upon even a tithe of myriads of living &amp; actual facts, which go
      along with, &amp; fill up this dry list of times &amp; places, it would
      outvie all the romances in the world, &amp; most of the famous histories
      &amp; biographies to boot. It does not need calling in play the imagination
      to see that in such a record as this lies folded a perfect poem of the war
      comprehending all its phases, its passions, the fierce tug of the
      secessionists, the interminable fibre of the national union, all the special
      hues &amp; characteristic forms &amp; pictures of actual battles with colors
      flying, rifles snapping, cannon thundering, grape whiring, armies
      struggling, ships at sea or bombarding shore batteries, skirmishes in woods,
      great pitched battles, &amp; all the profound scenes of individual death,
      courage, endurance &amp; superbest hardihood, &amp; splendid muscular
      wrestle of a newer large race of human giants with all furious passions
      aroused on one side, &amp; the sternness of an unalterable determination on
      the other" (Manuscripts of Walt Whitman in the Collection of American
      Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University;

   <p id="loc.00487_n40">40. General Thomas
      Williams, who had been in command of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and who was killed
      August 5, 1862, had in the early summer of that year made a survey of the
      stronghold at Vicksburg, and had projected a canal across the neck of land
      opposite Vicksburg, with a view of turning the channel of the Mississippi River
      into a new route—which would have left Vicksburg an inland town, or at most one
      with a deep and sluggish bayou in front of it. The plan failed because the canal
      built for this purpose was inaccurately located. Later, Grant made similar
      attempts—including the construction of a canal that began at Milliken's Bend,
      about twenty-five miles above Vicksburg and Grant's headquarters during the
      Vicksburg campaign. Heavy rains, however, defeated this attempt as well as
      others. Schmucker, pp. 566-67.<a href="#r40">[back]

      Fifty-first in the forces under Gen. Grant, operating against Vicksburgh. On the
      fall of that stronghold they were pushed off under Sherman as part of a small
      army toward Jackson, the capital of Mississippi. This was a tough little
      campaign. The drought and excessive heat, the dust everywhere two or three
      inches thick, fine as flour, rising in heavy clouds day after day as they
      marched, obscuring everything and making it difficult to breathe, will long be
      remembered. The Fifty-first was the second regiment entering Jackson at its
      capture, July 17, 1863." (Emory Holloway, ed., <em>The Uncollected
