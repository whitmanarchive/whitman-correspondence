      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of 20th 
      recd—At this present writing I don't think the <em>Tribune</em> will print
      your letter at all<sup><a href="#nyp.00440_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—if it 
      dont
      
       appear next Sunday,
      I doubt if it appears at all—the course of the T[ribune] towards me I think
      has been left to Wm Winter, who I have no doubt writes the squib in 
      T.
      
       of 24th May—&amp; also wrote (may be in conjunction with R H Stoddard,)<sup><a href="#nyp.00440_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> the notice of L of G in 
      T.
      
       four or five months
      ago—After Stedman's <em>Scribner</em> article a year or two ago
      the 
      T.
      
       extracted half a column of his condemnatory views &amp; opinions on my
      treatment of amativeness in L of G.<sup><a href="#nyp.00440_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—a few days
      afterward, an extract, offering third of a column from Mrs Gilchrists <em>Woman's Estimate</em> was sent Reid, but he refused to print
      it<sup><a href="#nyp.00440_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I think, at present at any rate, that
      indicates their stand—(expediency, popular current &amp;c)—carrying
      out the old enmity of Bayard Taylor,<sup><a href="#nyp.00440_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp;c
      &amp;c—
   </p>
   
   <p>Have you seen Dr Bucke's letter in <em>Springfield Republican</em> of
      May 23—and the vigorous editorial same number?<sup><a href="#nyp.00440_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> The
      Boston <em>Herald</em> May 24 (Supplement) takes the same ground<sup><a href="#nyp.00440_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>—both editorials would satisfy you
      perfectly—Shouldnt
      
       at all wonder if your guess about Rev T W Higginson<sup><a href="#nyp.00440_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> hits the nail—one nail—exactly on the
      head.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your line about the Emerson talk on the Common<sup><a href="#nyp.00440_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> &amp;c is
      very opportune—it was as you say—the <em>essential</em>
      matter, at the spine or abysm of all, such as the Bible often presents &amp; in all
      primal poetry &amp; attempt at returning to Creation's birth-innocence—let
      alone my attempt at the same result, based on modern science, biology &amp;
      physiology—was not touched upon at all by Emerson—but it was a splendid
      &amp; most sincere unfolding of the technical esthetic &amp; conventional &amp;
      technical literary points applicable—But you know, dear friend, my plan
      (hobby) is never to shirk the 
      enemys
      
       fullest tactics but to state them over again if
      possible better than ever—<em>I shall mind your admonition
         though</em>—
   </p>
   
   <p>As things are, I don't feel any resentment at all toward Osgood &amp; Co. A sharp
      friend here suggests that they themselves (O &amp; Co) had some hand in the
      Marston-Stevens proceeding &amp; rather egged it on—that they were losing,
      paying me 25 cts royalty, &amp;c &amp;c—<em>But I 
         havn't
         
          the least idea of any such thing</em>—I only mention it because
      I shouldn't wonder if it came up that way &amp; you will hear it broached—
   </p>
   
   <p>Dr Bucke is absent in Ottawa, Canada—from there he goes to
      Cincinnati—John Burroughs I suppose is in England—(he went off in a 
      depress'd
      
       humor—blue as indigo)—
   </p>
   
   <p>As I write—Thursday forenoon—it is raining again, with east wind &amp;
      the heavens all lead-colored—but I am feeling well as usual &amp; in good
      spirits—Sometimes I feel to welcome any <em>whack</em> that
      breaks the stupid monotony even of life's prosperous evenness—&amp; as to this
      last &amp; in some sense most marked buffeting in the fortunes of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>—why—if it 
      cant
      
       stand it &amp; throw it off
      &amp; go on better than ever, why let it go under—of which I 
      havn't
      
       the
      slightest idea though—but I feel sure the book will gather added, perhaps a
      main part, interest, from what it has gone through, from association—&amp; I
      shall too—I tickle myself with the thought how it may be said years hence that
      at any rate <em>no book on earth ever had such a
         history</em>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall keep you advised if I hear any thing—</p>

   <p>I have just had the Tribune of to-day, in which I find <em>the
         letter</em>—I don't know but Charles Eldridge was right<sup><a href="#nyp.00440_n12" id="r11">11</a></sup>—Being so much interested perhaps I am not a
      fair judge—but if ever Jupiter went into the press hurling the lightnings
      (&amp; yet a sort of Jovian continence) <em>this letter</em> has
      got him in—It is apparently printed with wonderful correctness—don't
      need a single alteration—it will live in literature at least as long as
      Junius—God bless you<sup><a href="#nyp.00440_n13" id="r12">12</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00440_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd May 29/82." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service Bureau
      | Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Philadelphia | Pa. | May 25 82 | 7
      PM.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00440_n2">2. But see the latter part
      of the letter.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00440_n3">3. Winter, the drama critic
      of the New York <em>Tribune</em>, and Stoddard, a writer and
      reviewer, were old enemies of Whitman (see Whitman's letter to O'Connor of ). The brief note in the
      newspaper on May 24 consisted chiefly of adverse comments from the Boston <em>Transcript</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00440_n4">4. "Walt Whitman's
      Naturalism," consisting largely of quotations from Stedman's article, appeared
      on November 7, 1880 (see the letter from Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of ).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00440_n5">5. Edwin Haviland Miller
      writes that it is difficult not to be irritated at times by Whitman's carping at
      people like Reid, who gave him considerable space in the New York <em>Tribune</em> during these years, and who printed O'Connor's
      attack on the poet's critics on May 25. On 
      O'Connor quoted what Reid had written to him: "I took great pleasure in printing
      your letter, because it was so cleverly done, and because, besides, I could not
      help having sympathy with it" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em> (New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914), 3:284).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00440_n6">6. Another favorite target
      of the Whitmanites.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00440_n7">7. The editorial in the
      Springfield <em>Republican</em>, entitled "The Prurient Prudes and
      'Leaves of Grass,'" quoted Whitman: "There is no bad personal feeling at
      all—W. W. considers himself treated by Osgood &amp; Co throughout with
      courtesy and even liberality." The newspaper again defended the poet on May 28
      and on June 11.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00440_n8">8. On  Fred R. Guernsey, of the Boston <em>Herald</em>, asked Whitman to write to the editor, E. B.
      Haskell, "in acknowledgment of his defence of you." The <em>Herald</em> supported Whitman against the Boston censors on May 24 and 28,
      and on June 2 it quoted Oscar Wilde's defense.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00440_n9">9. Colonel Thomas Wentworth
      Higginson (1823–1911), reformer and author, was a consistently hostile
      critic of Whitman. His first denunciation of the poet, "Unmanly Manhood," in <em>The Woman's Journal</em> on February 4, 1882, charged that
      Whitman, "with all his fine physique and his freedom from home-ties, never
      personally followed the drum, but only heard it from the comparatively remote
      distance of the hospital." O'Connor suggested on  that "Reverend" Higginson was an "instigator" of the whole Boston
      affair. He promised "in due time [to] plant a javelin where it will do him
      good."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00440_n10">10. The famous 1860 stroll
      in the Boston Common (see the letter from Whitman to Abby M. Price of ). On  O'Connor advised Whitman to "be careful in what you say of
      Emerson's position."<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00440_n12">11. On  O'Connor informed Whitman that Eldridge, who
      had read the manuscript of his letter to the New York <em>Tribune</em>, considered it "the best thing I have done."<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00440_n13">12. On  O'Connor expressed his gratitude for
      Whitman's praise: "I shall get nothing worth so much as your heartful 'God bless
      you,' flashing from the finale of your postscript" (Traubel, 3:282).<a href="#r12">[back]
