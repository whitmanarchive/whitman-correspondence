   <p>Although you hear from us so seldom yet we do not forget you—I expected to get to
      Camden before this<sup><a href="#loc.00474_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—but business prevented—We have had lots of political trouble here this spring and
      summer and the end is not yet—how it will affect me I am unable to even guess now—sometimes
      it looks bad and then again as if it would blow over—at any rate it cannot be long
      before it will decide itself one way or another<sup><a href="#loc.00474_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Tis a long while since we have heard from you—how are you getting along &nbsp;now and then
      we see some little thing in the papers—the last was that you were engaged in getting
      up another book<sup><a href="#loc.00474_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I was glad to know that you were feeling well enough—
   </p>
   
   <p>How is George and Loo. I hope well &nbsp;Is George busy still on the pipe question &nbsp;We
      are having very hot weather for the last few days—On Thursday next Hattie and Jessie
      depart for Iowa or Wisconsin for a month or two—Jess and Hat have grown quite up and
      begin to look like young ladies—they keep to school pretty close and study well—
   </p>
   
   <p>Let me hear form you when you can—if matters change here I shall make you a visit
      for awhile—I should endeavor to get a job in Baltimore as I see they are getting ready
      to build works there—
   </p>
   
   <p>Love to all—not forgetting Ed</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00474_n1">1. Jeff had visited Walt
      Whitman at least twice since the last extant letter: in September 1873 and June
      1874 (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961-77], 2:241, 306).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00474_n2">2. In April 1875 a new
      Board of Water Commissioners was appointed. Jeff's close friend Henry Flad, a
      member of the board since 1867 and president since 1873, was among those
      replaced. Because one of the new appointees was Joseph Brown, the former mayor,
      Jeff may be concerned that politics is exerting too much influence over the
      waterworks. He may also be anxious about the vote on the new state constitution
      scheduled for August 1875 in which St. Louis would be granted home rule. See
      .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00474_n3">3. In the spring of 1875,
      Walt Whitman began work on his so-called "Centennial Edition" of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The
         Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</em> [New York:
      Macmillan, 1955; rev. ed., New York University Press, 1967], p. 463).<a href="#r3">[back]
