   <p>Yours 
      rec'd, &amp; glad to hear from you. Wonder if you—or you &amp;
      Guernsey<sup><a href="#ucb.00057_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—couldn't help me a little. I am
      coming on to Boston in ten or twelve days to remain about two months—&amp; I
      want a plain boardinghouse or good furnished room secured, so I can go right
      there—Let me give you fuller particulars. Osgood &amp; Co: are going to
      publish a complete &amp; new volume of my poems, &amp; I am coming on to see to
      &amp; oversee it, every page—will take six or eight weeks. <em>I
         want quarters near, or eligible to get at, their printing office</em>, so I can
      be there two or three hours every day, handy—What I want of you is to
      ascertain (if you 
      dont
      
       know already—is it Cambridge?) where their printing is done,
      &amp; then secure me either board in full, not more than 6, 7 or $8 a
      week—or a nice furnished room handy as I said. I trust you or Guernsey to know
      what would suit me &amp; do for me—Try to write me here, so I can get it by
      first of next week, say 15th or 16th—as I shall want to be coming on within
      two or three days after that—If you go to Osgood's show them this letter. I am
      well as usual of late—have been jaunting about the Long Island &amp; Jersey
      shores &amp;c. last two weeks.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="ucb.00057_n1">1. Sylvester Baxter
      (1850–1927) was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>.
      Apparently he met Whitman for the first time when he delivered his Lincoln
      address in Boston in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and
      Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many
      newspaper columns in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to
      obtain a pension for the poet.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="ucb.00057_n2">2. Like Baxter, Frederic R.
      Guernsey was associated with the Boston <em>Herald</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
