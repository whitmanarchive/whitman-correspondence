   <p>Tho't I w'd send a line as you prob. want to know—I think I shall pull through, but
      it is really the toughest whack of all coming on the rest, &amp; the condition I am &amp;
      have been in—one of the best points is a good bowel discharge an hour ago, the
      first of a week—fortunately too the weather is favorable again—sweat freely—eat
      little or nothing—drink milk punch—have g't thirst—phlegm accumulations in throat
      &amp; chest pretty bad still but not as bad (half strangling me at night) as they
      were—I am at this moment sitting here in big chair, some headache &amp;c but more
      comfortable than might be expected—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
