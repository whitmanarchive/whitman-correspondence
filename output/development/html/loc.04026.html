   <p>Though I am pretty well physically it is very lonesome &amp; dreary to me here, &amp; I have
      been thinking all day how much I would like to come over &amp; see you all, &amp; stay awhile
      with you. Herbert, see about the stove &amp; have put up soon as convenient—&amp; have some
      dry oak wood sawed the right length, split, &amp; carried up there, &amp; piled in the room.
      Send me word before the end of the week. I wish much to come—Love to all—
   </p>

      when I come over)
