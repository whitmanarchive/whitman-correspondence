      <br></br><br></br>Friend Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your kind letter came to hand in due time. And as this is Christmas night and I alone
      in my Shanty will improve it in writing You althouth there is not much new to write Yet I will make the Endeavor. I have been away all
      day as this is a day that all Niggers Should be free. and haveing an invitiation out to Eat roast Turkey of course excepted it and had a verry nice time yet I think had I been in New York or Brooklyn that I would enjoyed My-Self much better and Shall be glad to
      get back there once more as a citizen for to go there on a leave of absence is only
      an agrivation as the time is always So Short that one cannot heardly turn before he has to come back
   </p>
   
   <p>I Suppose that you have heard that we have a new Colonel Commissioned in our regt.
      who is none other than Capt. McKiben Bronets Brig. Genl. And I heard that there had
      been a Commisson issued as Lt. Col. to Some out Sider, I don't know how true it is, Yet I think it
      is a Shame to run over all of our Officers that are now Priosners of War  Who have Served and fought in the regiment Since the Orginization and for my part I Shall resign if what I hear is true. So You need not be Surprised
      if You hear that Your humble Servant has put in his Unconditional Surrender, and retires
      to Private life
   </p>
   
   <p>We have Sent Your Brother Georges large Trunk home to Your Mothers Address by Express
      So if you have not already received it You Can look out for it
   </p>
   
   <p>Hopeing to hear from you Soon</p>
