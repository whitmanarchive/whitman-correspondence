      The motto that you send for the title-page<sup><a href="#med.00756_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> would do extremely
      well<sup><a href="#med.00756_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—meantime I had picked out one from <u>Lucretius</u> as follows:
      
      Quae cum magna modis multis miranda videtur
      <br>gentibus humanis regio visendaque fertur,
      <br>rebus opima bonis, multa munita virum vi,
      <br>nil tamen hoc habuisse viro praeclarius in se
      <br>nec sanctum magis et mirum carumque videtur.
      <br>carmina quin etiam divini pectoris eius
      <br>vociferantur et exponunt praeclara reperta
      <br>ut vix humana videatur stirpe creatus.<br><br>   
      
      which being interpreted is:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> 
      Now though this great country is seen to deserve in many ways the
      wonder of mankind and is held to be well worth visiting, rich in all good
      things, guarded by large force of men, yet seems it to have held within
      it nothing more glorious than this man, nothing more holy marvellous
      and dear. The verses too of his godlike genius cry with a loud voice and set forth
      in such wise his glorious discoveries that he hardly
      seems born of a mortal stock.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      It is vulgarly supposed that by "this great country" Lucretius
      meant <u>Sicily</u> and by "this man" <u>Empedocles</u>; but it is plain enough that
      he really meant America and Walt Whitman—Any one can see that
      "Vociferantur" must have been intended to apply to the "barbaric yawp".
      Isn't it so?

      <br></br><u xmlns="">RMB</u>.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Should I take the motto from Lucretius I am uncertain whether to use the latin or
      the translation—the latin of course wd be the best but unfortunately so few read it.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00756_n1">1. Although only the final
      two pages of this letter have survived, it may be dated with some certainty. On
      June 10, 1882, Whitman made the following entry in his Commonplace Book: "sent
      letter to Dr Bucke, ab't 'motif' of his book / &amp; ab't printing in Phila"
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Whitman's letter to Bucke of June 10,
      1882, is listed among the lost letters in <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller (New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77), 3:437. If the normal pattern of delivery and
      response was followed, Bucke would have received the letter on June 12, 1882,
      and probably would have answered the same day. On June 17, 1882, Whitman wrote
      to Rees Welsh &amp; Company of Philadelphia about the publication of Bucke's
      book (<em>Walt Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
      1131).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00756_n2">2. Since Whitman's letter
      to Bucke is lost and Bucke's <em>Walt Whitman</em> was published
      without an epigraph, it is impossible to determine Whitman's "motto." Whitman
      rejected the quotation from Lucretius (<em>De Rerum Nature</em>,
      1, ll. 726–33), and Bucke acquiesced (see the letter from Bucke to Whitman
      of ). Bucke was, however, fond of the
      quotation, and after Whitman's death he used it—in English—for the
      title page of <em>In Re</em> (1893). It is important to note that
      Bucke selected an epigraph from Lucretius, one of the most prominent of the
      materialist philosophers.<a href="#r2">[back]
