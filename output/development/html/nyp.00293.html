      <br></br><br></br>Dear John Burroughs,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have had another severe spell the last five weeks—head troubles, &amp; stomach troubles,
      
      &amp; <em>liver</em> troubles—the doctor thinks the latter the seat &amp; basis this time of all, or nearly
      all—head-swimming, faintness, vomiting, &amp;c—but for three or four days past have been
      easier—am up—didn't go out for three to four weeks, but am venturing out a little
      now—hope 
      &amp; quite expect to get at least as well as I was before this spell—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Eldridge has made me a call of two or three hours, (on his return from Boston to Wash'n)—Seems to be nothing very new among our friends at Wash'n—Marvin<sup><a href="#nyp.00293_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> has written me twice—he has been reading your "Notes," 
      &amp; is quite possessed with them—also "Dem. Vistas"—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am writing very little—have a piece, a <em>melange</em>, 
      prose &amp; verse, in the "<em>Christmas Graphic</em>"<sup><a href="#nyp.00293_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—(comes out in a week or so,) in which I say a brief word about Emerson—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To eke out my letter I send a scrap from paper about death of a young friend of mine<sup><a href="#nyp.00293_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—also another scrap—also another from <em>London Academy</em>,<sup><a href="#nyp.00293_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> (which latter only please return when you write)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Best love to 'Sula—<em>Merry Christmas</em>—do you get in the new house? 
      Write me a good long letter—I wish I was with you—
   </p>

   <p id="nyp.00293_n1">1. The executors dated this
      letter 1873. However, that 1874 is the correct year is evidenced by the
      following notes.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00293_n2">2. Joseph B. Marvin had been
      co-editor of the <em>Radical</em> in 1866–1867; see Frank
      Luther Mott, <em>A History of American Magazines</em> (Cambridge:
      Harvard University Press, 1938–1968), 3:78n. Later he was employed in the
      Treasury Department in Washington. On , Marvin wrote to Whitman: "I read and re-read your poems, and the
      'Vistas,' and more and more see that I had but a faint comprehension of them
      before. They surpass everything. All other books seem to me weak and unworthy my
      attention. I read, Sunday, to my wife, Longfellows verses on Sumner, in the last
      Atlantic, and then I read your poem on the Death of Lincoln. It was like
      listening to a weak-voiced girl singing with piano accompanyment, and then to an
      oratorio by the whole Handel Society, with accompanyment by the Music Hall
      organ" (The Library of Congress). His veneration of Whitman is also transparent
      in an article in the <em>Radical Review</em>, 1 (1877),
      224–259.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00293_n3">3. "A Christmas Garland"
      consisted of miscellaneous observations on various subjects and occasional
      poems; it is reprinted in <em>The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of
         Walt Whitman</em> (1921), ed. Emory Holloway, 2:53–58.<a href="#r3">[back]
