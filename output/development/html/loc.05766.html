      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I promised you I would send you fifty dollars four times over for your portrait by
      Hine,<sup><a href="#loc.05766_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> but the thought has occurred to me that your
      moving may make it desirable to have some extra cash just now, and so I send you my
      check for one hundred dollars and will send the balance before you need it, I trust;
      if not a gentle reminder from you will fetch it. 
   </p>
   
   <p> As I looked at your things packed up for moving, I wondered if you had in any way
      by
      will or otherwise secured their safe care when you have passed away. Some one who
      loves you should have them to give to the world in proper shape. I do not consider
      myself the proper one, although I hope some day to tell the world "what I know about
      Walt Whitman," but the safe care of your literary remains I feel anxious to have in
      right hands. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Mr. Montgomery<sup><a href="#loc.05766_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> was wonderfully delighted with meeting you, and talked of nothing
      else all day and evening. He is a man of very marked ability, who will be heard of
      before long in politics and literature. I think he has a wonderfully well-balanced
      mind. Alma<sup><a href="#n3029" id="r3">3</a></sup> was sorely disappointed at my not bringing you home
      with us Sunday and hope you will very soon visit us. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I want you to write me the full history of the painting by Hine—when, where,
      how, &amp;c &amp;c. 
   </p>

      Sincerely yours, 
      <br></br>J. H. Johnston

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05766_n1">1. Charles Hine
      (1827–1871) did an early oil painting of Walt Whitman, the engraving of
      which was the frontispiece for the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>. In 1889 Whitman observed of Hine's portrait: "the best of all"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      [1906–1996], 9 vols., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.58.html">4:378</a>).<a href="#r1">[back]
