   <p id="loc.01717_n1">1. This draft letter is endorsed, "sent Thos.
      O'Kane"; "Letter to O'Kane | April 22 | '74."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0454">2. O'Kane, a New York book dealer, took over the books
      still in the possession of Michael Doolady (a bookseller to whom Whitman wrote
      on ) on April 22, 1874. On
      December 29, 1873, Walt Whitman withdrew his books from O'Kane, and also
      dismissed Piper, the Boston outlet. At the same time he entrusted the whole
      matter to Asa K. Butts &amp; Co., which went into bankruptcy in the following
      year. Though Walt Whitman wrote cordially to O'Kane on , he later became hostile. Citing only the initials,
      Richard Maurice Bucke, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (1883), in his
      "official" biography (46), averred that O'Kane and Somerby, Butts's successor,
      "took advantage of [Walt Whitman's] helplessness to embezzle the amounts
      due—(they calculated that death would soon settle the score and rub it out.)"
      This sounds like an interpolation composed by the poet himself; note also
      Whitman's , letter to Jeannette
      Gilder, in which he wrote, "every one of the three successive book agents I have
      had in N. Y. has embezzled the proceeds." In an address book (The Library of
      Congress #108) Walt Whitman scrawled on a piece of O'Kane's stationery,
