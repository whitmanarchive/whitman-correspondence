   </p>
   
   
   <p> What revelations of the last 18 months! </p>
   
   <p> How soul-sickening! </p>
   
   <p> What "joy of suffering" there from! In the summer of '80, my oldest son (of this,
      my
      second wife,) being then a well-grown, strong, and healthy boy of 17 years 4 months,
      took a notion he must go to Texas. He did tolerably well then for two years. He
      become large sized and extra strong.....A woman 2 years his senior, a sort of
      "heiress" (in a small way,) began to think she must have a husband; and after a
      failure to get another young fellow (a kinsman of ours) to come from there,) opened
      up a correspondence with our
      boy. At the same time she coquetted with another young man nearer home. Our boy came
      home, and seemed to become crazed for  a person of no accomplishments or
      charms (whatever) unless a seductive pretence or fancy of attachment—while the
      very climax of indecision and inconstancy. In spite of all I could say—in
      spite of the "Body Electric" with its grand "old man, a common farmer"—in
      spite of all a "philosopher" could say or plead (from stores of reading &amp;
      reflection) they married—or rather consorted. Straightway he went to hardest
      work like the wildest fanatic. Building, building, &amp;c—not too much tho'
      except that his foundation was—SAND! 20 months hardest work (and
      wretchedness.) 20 months supreme idling, "gadding", tales to "Ma!" To
      others—"he would be good to me if I would let him."  Result—a deliberate,
      soldier-like suicide! He kept his troubles almost entirely concealed from his
      parents—we thoughts things were going just a little bad. The woman's people
      knew much more. Her four brothers of whom two were larger men, one as large, and
      one smaller, were a lot of jealous, stingy, envious fellows, who concealed their
      ill-will. (They had before maltreated a brother-in-law and a stepfather, and it
      doubtless mortified them for people to know they could'n't do the muscular and
      giant-willed young lion in the same way.) He was kind to them as if they were
      babies! They had to have their revenge (after his death) on <u>his
         creditors</u> and his innocent father.   They made the widow repudiate all
      of his debts—tho' universally known that his improvements on her land were
      worth as much as the debts, and there was much added to her personal effects. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
      
      After long and patient reasoning the "old man" defied one of them to combat (with
      nature's weapon's)—he accepted—then weakened, "wilted", then took up a
      fence rail (having once killed a man with one at a single blow,) and made a most
      deliberate, long-continued attempt to kill. Well! he didn't kill, frighten or
      drive—and in all ways exhausted himself. Never was a sublimer scene. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Yet the most manifest, unblushing corruption (official and semi-official)<sup><a href="#loc.02407_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and a
      total lack of manliness all around us seems about to excuse the offender 
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p> I am at our Circuit Court—been here some days. Since that young man was taking
      a <u>law</u> advantage of myself and other creditors of my dead
      son, after he went back on his agreement for a pugilistic encounter, I determined
      to
      only parry his many blows with steadfast demeanor 'till reflection [
      <span class="unclear">could?</span>]
       stop him;
      but he stopped only from exhaustion, (as proven by his retreat within a gate in
      search of more effective weapons—and finding nothing but one something to
      throw at me, he left off, the picture of a miserable despair.) Yet with all his and
      his folks' subsequent wretchedness, they could not master their niggardliness to do
      anything for anybody except a few least needy creditors. These last got vague and
      indirect promises—doubtless to prevent or secure inffuence. 
   </p>
   
   <p> What a miracle or strange happening—that <u>he</u> should be <u>drawn</u> and <u>passed</u> as a grand juror at the court
      succeeding! Some other suggestive and ugly facts. 
   </p> 
   
   
   
   
   <p> The cold-hearted young widow who had witnessed and consented to her handsome (and
      for her, every way noble) husband boring a hole through his own broad and generous
      breast with a double load of buckshot, also witnessed without any remonstrance the
      attempt to demolish the gray-haired father-in-law. 
   </p>
   
   <p> After brutal insults put on me in his brother's house, and in presence of two of
      his
      big and silent brothers (when I was still reasoning the matter,) and some months
      more of waiting, I went to his (bachelor) home, to challenge him. The corrupt and
      the unmanly make this their excuse, and say a petit jury would (as they fear) fail
      or refuse to execute the plain letter and
      spirit of the law. 
   </p>
   
   <p> My kin, always recognized as of superior honesty, have shown themselves in all this
      matter immeasurably sluggish and spiritless (as I wrote you some years ago that they
      were.) 
   </p>
   
   <p> Dear Walt, write to me at "Mid." </p>
   
   
   <p>My kin are much allied with those bad people by marriages. Our broad estates are all
      adjoining.<sup><a href="#loc.02407_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.
