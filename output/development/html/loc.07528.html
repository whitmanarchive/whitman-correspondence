   <p>Some days now since I have written—but nothing notable or
      different—rather a bad dull time the last two days—indigestion—bad
      weather—muggy warm, the air a sort of diluted tar—a promise of better

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0590">3. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="n4302">5. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on
      Osler, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitman-dev.unl.edu/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_202.html">Osler, Dr. William (1849–1919)</a>," <em>Walt

      dropped a line to the poet: "Herald wanted to do you a favor by early notice of
      your new book. Sorry you didn't get the idea." On September 23, in an article
      entitled "Walt Whitman's Words," a <em>Herald</em> reporter,
      probably John Habberton, quoted the following from his "notes of Whitman's
      opinions, which were revised by him": "I am an old bachelor who never had a love
      affair. Nature supplied the place of a bride, with suffering to be nursed and
      scenes[?] to be poetically clothed." Walt Whitman denied that he had revised the
      article (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.76.html">Friday, September 28, 1888</a> and <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). Despite the inaccuracies, the poet found
      the piece "friendly"; (see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.74.html">Wednesday, September 26, 1888</a>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.75.html">Thursday, September 27, 1888</a>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.87.html">Tuesday, October 9, 1888</a>, and <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.90.html">Friday, October 12, 1888</a>).<a href="#r7">[back]
