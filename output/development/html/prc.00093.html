      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Linton,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I think of wanting this<sup><a href="#prc.00093_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> engraved (exactly this size, and
      general design) for a frontispiece for my next edition of "Leaves of Grass." Do you
      think it would make a good picture?—Would it suit you to do it for me? If yes what
      would be the price?<sup><a href="#prc.00093_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I shall be here for some two weeks
      yet—then to return to Washington—
   </p>
   
   <p>—Send me word by mail, &amp; if convenient appoint an hour, day, &amp; place in
      New York, where we could meet &amp; talk it over—Bring this picture with you. I
      will be there as you appoint.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William J. Linton
      (1812–1897), a British-born wood engraver, came to the United States in
      1866 and settled near New Haven, Connecticut. He illustrated the works of John
      Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, and
      others, wrote the "indispensable" <em>History of Wood-Engraving in
         America</em> (1882), and edited <em>Poetry of America,
         1776–1876</em> (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Whitman's
      poems as well as a frontispiece engraving of the poet. According to his <em>Threescore and Ten Years, 1820 to
         1890—Recollections</em> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Whitman
      in Washington and later visited him in Camden (which Whitman reported in his
      , letter to Peter Doyle): "I
      liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, . . . a true poet
      who could not write poetry, much of 
      wilfulness
      
       accounting for his neglect of form."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00093_n1">1. Though the copy Whitman
      enclosed is now lost, this was no doubt a copy of the portrait Whitman later
      identified as "Photograph'd from life, Washington, 1871, by G. C. Potter, and
      drawn on wood by W. J. Linton" (<em>Leaves of Grass</em>, 1876,
      vi).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00093_n2">2. Linton's response is
      missing, but apparently he asked for a large sum of money to do the engraving,
      because on , Whitman replied: "I
      have been delaying to write you about the portrait in answer—wanting <em>you</em> to do it—&amp; wanting, if I could arrange it,
      to give you the full price—I will not have the job done by any
      second-rater, &amp; have concluded to give it up for the present—unless it
      could be done by you for $50." Linton agreed to the price.<a href="#r2">[back]
