      Dear Driend Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It has been along time since I have heard from you so I thought that I would write
      you aline and let you know that I am well and enjoying good health and I hope that
      you may receive the same Blessing I have writen to you three before but have received no answer. Now Walt I have not forgoten you. I look at the picture I fancy that it looks just like you every time I look
      at if I wish you are here that I might shake hands with you I [

   </p>
   
   <p>if you get this I think you will write to me</p>            
   
   
   <p>Well Walt I must tell you the news nothine so very new. Walt on the 19th day of aug last I took A pardner for life. She proves very kind to me so far and I trust that
      She will tide out. Walt I dont say much about Edition so adont think of much to write as this makes the third that I write to your one. &amp; so good
      luck to you if we never see each others face again but trust to providence. I will
      draw to a close so good by.

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George M. Williamson was a New York
      book collector who contacted Whitman several times about purchasing manuscripts,
      and later published <em>Catalogue of A Collection of Books,
         Letters, and Manuscripts written by Walt Whitman, in the Library of George
         M. Williamson, Grand View on Hudson</em> (New York: The Marion Press, 1903).
      Other items in Williamson's collection, which was sold at auction in 1908,
      included George Washington's copy of <em>Don Quixote</em>, a
      presentation copy of Longfellow's "Evangeline," Hawthorne's annotated copy of
      <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, and "a very remarkable collection
      of Walt Whitman's works" (<em>The George M. Williamson
         Collection</em> [Anderson Galleries, Inc., 1908]).
