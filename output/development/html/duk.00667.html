   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>In a ,
      letter, Walt Whitman offered "Song of the Redwood-Tree" to Henry M. Alden,
      editor of <em>Harper's Monthly Magazine</em>. Of "Song of the
      Redwood-Tree" Rudolf Schmidt observed: "It is your old great theme in a simple
      and powerful stile, embracing the holy and original nation of the far West"
      (Syracuse University; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], 4:464). For digital images of the poem as it
      appeared in <em>Harper's Monthly Magazine</em>, see "."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00667_n1">1. Since Alden's acceptance
      of this poem is unmistakably dated November 1, 1873 (Clifton Waller Barrett
      Collection, University of Virginia), either the date of this letter (which may
      be a draft) or of Alden's is incorrect. The poem appeared in the <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00015.html">February 1874</a> edition of <em>Harper's New Monthly
         Magazine</em>. Alden (1836–1919) was managing editor of <em>Harper's Weekly</em> from 1863 to 1869 and editor of <em>Harper's New Monthly Magazine</em> from 1869 until his
      death.<a href="#r1">[back]
