      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Whitman;
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Herewith you will three dollars, the price of the copy of Leaves of Grass which I
      have just received—I am greatly obliged for this copy, but still more thankful
      to you for having written the Book. I know that the narrow minded of this world will
      depreciate &amp; condemn it,— let your consolation be that the world is
      growing &amp; will at last appreciate the great thoughts contained in it—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You say that every thing is going on in the
      office as when I left—Have you not
      received a permanent place? I have deeply  regretted the fact, that I did not
      know your place to be temporary till after my resignation—I most earnestly
      desired Mr. Stanbery to give you an
      office—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>It is very agreeable to receive much kind remembrances from the gentlemen in the
      office—I am sure that I have not more of their esteem and love than they have
      of mine —
      Bee
      
       good enough to say so to them—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will deliver your message to
      Charley—He
      is hard at work in a drug store with a very sore eye from carelessly handling of
      some acid—
   </p>
   
   <p>The late elections in the Northern States have  made a profound &amp; I trust an
      improving impression in Ky—
   </p>

      attorney general by Abraham Lincoln in 1864. He continued to serve under Andrew
