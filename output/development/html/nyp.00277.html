      He duly received the previous ones also, making three letters from you.<sup><a href="#nyp.00277_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> 
      He is entirely satisfied with your action, &amp; with Mr. Hotten's,<sup><a href="#nyp.00277_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> 
      in regard to the London selection &amp; reprint, and seems pleased with 
      the condition into which that enterprise has been shaped. 
      He spoke with deep appreciation of you &amp; your letters.

   <p id="nyp.00277_n1">1. 
      This letter's envelope bears the address, "William O'Connor, | Light House
      Bureau."<br><br>
      Perhaps because O'Connor's correspondence with William Michael Rossetti had
      preceded his own, Walt Whitman encouraged his friend to reply to Rossetti's
      letter of . When O'Connor
      wrote to Rossetti on January 20, 1867, he included Whitman's paragraph with
      only a few unimportant alterations; see <em>Rossetti
         Papers</em> (London: Sands &amp; Co, 1903), 342.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00277_n4">3. John Camden Hotten
      (1832–1873) printed Swinburne's <em>Poems and Ballads</em>
      when another publisher withdrew after the book caused a furor. Perhaps because
      he had lived in the United States from 1848 to 1856, Hotten introduced to an
      English audience such writers as Lowell, Artemus Ward, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
      and Bret Harte. After his death, his business was purchased by Chatto and
      Windus. In his letter to Conway on December 5, 1866, O'Connor had suggested
      Hotten as the English publisher of Walt Whitman: "Seems to me the courage that
      prints Laus Veneris might dare this" (Yale). Whitman consented to the sale of
      Hotten's English edition of <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/british/rossetti.html">Leaves of Grass</a></em> in his  letter to Moncure D. Conway.<a href="#r3">[back]
