      This letter's envelope bears the address, "John Burroughs, | Esopus, Ulster
      co | New York." It is postmarked: "Camden | Oct | 12 | N.J."<br><br>
      Since Whitman went to Washington on November 8, 1875 (see Whitman's , and  letters to Peter Doyle), 1875 appears to be a
      plausible date.<a href="#r1">[back]
