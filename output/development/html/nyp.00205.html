      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I got both your letters—the last one has just come—It is too bad to be so troubled
      about a house—but then, Mother, there might be troubles a great deal worse than that—Mother,
      when you get there, &amp; feel able, you must write me a few lines, &amp; give me the No.
      of the house, &amp; the right address, &amp;c.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, mother, you must all try to get along the best you can. Try to take it easy
      as possible.
   </p>
