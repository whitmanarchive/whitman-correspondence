      "1874," evidently by Reid.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.02347_n2">2. Whitelaw Reid
      (1837–1912) was the editor of the New York <em>Tribune</em>
      from 1872 to 1905. He met Whitman in the hospitals during the Civil War. Of his
      relations with the poet Reid later observed: "No one could fail then [during the
      War] to admire his zeal and devotion, and I am afraid that at first my regard
      was for his character rather than his poetry. It was not till long after 'The
      Leaves of Grass' period that his great verses on the death of Lincoln conquered
      me completely"; see Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, Gorham Press, 1915), 213, and
      <em>Studies in Bibliography</em>, 8 (1956),
      242–249.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02347_n3">3. Reid apparently did not
      publish this unidentified article.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02347_n4">4. Seemingly in a lost
      letter to Reid, Whitman had protested what he considered a slurring reference to
      his health in a news item in the <em>Tribune</em>. In apologizing
      on , Reid promised to "have a
      paragraph within a day or two, which will I think relieve you of the idea that
      we had any such intention." A complimentary notice appeared in the issue of
      December 26, 1874; In his  letter
      to Ellen O'Connor, Whitman referred to this notice as "the most flourishing puff
      yet given me—&amp; from <em>them!</em>"<a href="#r4">[back]
