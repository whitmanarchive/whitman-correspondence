      <br></br><br></br>Dear Bee
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter came an hour ago, &amp; we have all read it with deepest interest—praying
      that all will go well with your dearest mother—&amp; having no doubt it will—Hattie has
      been quite unwell for two nights, &amp; yesterday—a sort of <u>Cholera</u> <u>morbus</u> &amp; fever—but is pretty well to-day,—is dress'd &amp; down stairs again—the rest all well—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I rec'd a letter from Herby—he said he had written to you all, at the same time with mine—He
      had arrived at Esopus, &amp; was having good times—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>—As I was down by the market here three hours ago I met Mr Stafford, &amp; have had a
      talk &amp; a short ride with him—he came up with a load of cabbages, which he sold, &amp;
      has just started for home—All are well, (although Mrs S is hardly so, either, I think
      overworked &amp; too much tasked &amp; nervous)<sup><a href="#upa.00058_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>—I have rec'd I think from Edw'd Carpenter the <u>Daily News</u> (London) with a long very fine <u>resumé</u>-article on <u>Thiers</u>—which I will bring or send you, for yourself &amp; (by &amp; by) your mother's reading—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I am feeling comfortable—go out some hours every day, enjoying the fine Sept: weather—</p>
