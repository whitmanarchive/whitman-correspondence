   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00428_n12">1. 
      Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the date October 26, 1863 to this letter on an
      accompanying slip of paper held in the Trent Collection (not reproduced
      here). Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77], 1:374). Because this letter echoes Walt Whitman's
      description of his new boarding arrangement with Eliza S. Baker, the letter
      must be in response to his 
      letter. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote on the Monday (she dated the letter
      "Monday evening") following her receipt of Walt's letter, so the date
      October 26, 1863 is correct.

   <p id="duk.00428_n8">2. Walt Whitman's concerns
      about his mother's health were raised by Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's  letter to Walt: Jeff described her
      as "failing rapidly."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">3. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00423_n7">4. The church is Henry Ward
      Beecher's Plymouth Church. Beecher (1813–1887), Congregational clergyman
      and brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, accepted the pastorate of the Plymouth
      Church, Brooklyn, in 1847. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son Edward attended
      Beecher's church.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00428_n11">5. Walt Whitman had moved to
      456 Sixth Street West near Pennsylvania Avenue, and he wrote that his room
      "looks south" (see his  letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman). He boarded with Eliza S. Baker, a widow, and her
      granddaughter (see Kim Roberts, "A Map of Whitman's Washington Boarding Houses
      and Work Places," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 22.1
      [November 2004], 24).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="duk.00422_n2">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="duk.00465_n9">7. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York

   <p id="duk.00467_n1">8. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n6">9. Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
