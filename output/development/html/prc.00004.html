   <p>Dear Sir: The price of "1861," if you print it, is $20. You are at liberty to make
      any verbal alterations. The envelope is of course to return it in, if you cannot use
      it.<sup><a href="#prc.00004_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours truly</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Lowell was editor of the
      <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> from 1857 to 1861. No admirer of
      Whitman, he evidently printed Whitman's poem at Emerson's suggestion; see Gay
      Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of
         Walt Whitman</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1955; rev. ed., New York University
      Press, 1967), 238. For other correspondence with the <em>Atlantic
         Monthly</em>, see Whitman's letter from 
      . Portia Baker analyzes
      Whitman's relations with this magazine in <em>American
         Literature</em> 6 (November 1934), 283–301.

   <p id="prc.00004_n2">2. On October 8, 1861,
      Lowell wrote to James T. Fields: "I enclose . . . three [poems] from Walt
      Whitman. '1861' he says is $20. the others $8. each"; see M. A. De Wolfe Howe,
      ed., <em>New Letters of James Russell Lowell</em> (New York:
      Harper, 1932), 102. On October 10, 1861, the editors of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> declined "the three poems with which you have favored
      us, but which we could not possibly use before their interest,—which is of the
      present,—would have passed" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1906-1996], 9 vols., 2:213).
      When Horace Traubel asked Whitman in 1888 for the titles of these poems, he
      replied: "I don't just remember: I do remember that the idea that their interest
      was of the present struck me as being a bit odd: I always have written with
      something more than a simply contemporary perspective" (2:213). "1861" appeared
      in <em>Drum-Taps</em> (1865).<a href="#r2">[back]
