   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).

   <p id="loc.03931_n2">3. On this date Whitman
      recorded the following in his Commonplace Book: "To day I begin my 69th
      year—almost altogether disabled in walking power &amp; bodily
      movement—writing &amp; composition power fair—hand-writing power
      pretty good—appetite fair—sleep fair to middling, not markedly bad,
      &amp; not really good—weigh 200 over—. . . I sit in the big arm
      chair nearly all the time—read &amp; (partially) write much or rather most
      of the time—Sidney Morse here sculping the full length sitting figure in
      rocking chair from life—seems to me I like it well—O'Connor in So:
      California, sick—frequent visitors &amp; some dear friends call to see
      me—" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). A photograph of the
      sculpture is the frontispiece to Traubel's third volume of <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
