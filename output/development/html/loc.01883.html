      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. [illegible]
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your letter with much pleasure. The facts about Whitman are briefly these.
      He lives with his brother, &amp; is (I hope &amp; believe) free from any real finish of poverty:
      but he has little or nothing of his own, &amp; the American public continues to reject
      his books. He sent me over, for [
      <span class="unclear">re?</span>]
      publication in England, an American newspaper notice setting forth in strong terms
      the unfavorable
      
      side of his position: this I got published in the Atheneum of 11 March. Buchanan saw
      it there, &amp; sent his letter to the Daily News followed (14 March) by another letter
      of mine—wh. I infer you have not seen. It said that a friend &amp; I had already written to Whitman
      bespeaking various copies of his forthcoming books; that I had then asked Wh. whether he wd. like me to push a similar or any other scheme among his admirers here; &amp; that I was
      (&amp; still I am) awaiting his reply.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Since my D.N. letter several people have written to me offering to buy the books,
      or subscribe money: about £25 altogether: &amp; Buchanan has received other similar offers.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I did not see the article in the Standard: there was a very offensive one (not so
      however to me personally) in last Saturday Review.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I write presently about these matters to Wh—shall apprise him of your letter. When I receive his reply, I shall know exactly
      what—or whether anything—further shd. be done.
   </p>

      With best regards
      <br></br>Very truly Yours,
      <br></br>W. M. Rossetti.

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
