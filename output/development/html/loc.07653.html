   <p>A mark'd &amp; good &amp; welcome change of temperature the first thing in the
      morning—a merino undershirt &amp; socks—&amp; a coat—it is just
      right to-day &amp; it helps me—now past for nine days uninterrupted hot &amp;
      sweltering—frequent rains (evn'gs or nights) but not the least
      relief—(good they say for the corn crop)—I have been the last hour and
      over with the proof of "Elias Hicks," the concluding paper in the <em>Boughs</em><sup><a href="#n3999" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Shall have to wait &amp; slowly subside into some verdict
      (literary &amp; personal) for myself about it all—am not certain whether I am
      satisfied or no—Have just sent the <em>Herald</em> (at their
      request) a short poem for Sheridan's burial<sup><a href="#loc.07653_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I
      expect it will be in H. 12th<sup><a href="#loc.07653_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—

   <p>Saturday—toward noon—Aug. 11.—
      Delightful day—am sitting here ab't as usual—had my breakfast ab't
      9—(get my dinner ab't 4 or ½ past)—nothing very notable—rec'd
      a letter from Mrs. Costelloe<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup>—nothing very
      special—but I enclose it as you might care to hear—I also send proof
      pages 119 to 127—part of "Elias Hicks"<sup><a href="#loc.07510_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup>—In a few days shall send 118
      &amp; all the rest—I send my best remembrances &amp; respects to Mr
      Harkness<sup><a href="#loc.07653_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup>—I believe Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r8">8</a></sup> is coming soon back to America—quiet day here—

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      read: "H. Saturday 11th (possibly 12th)." On the following day Whitman struck

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">5. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
