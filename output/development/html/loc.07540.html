   <p>Seems curiously quiet for election day,<sup><a href="#loc.07540_n6" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; has been all the time here—At my
      proposal Ed Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r3">3</a></sup> went over to Phila: from 12 to 3 &amp; took
      a note I sent to Tom Donaldson<sup><a href="#syr.00024_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—(Ed says D treated
      him like a prince)—I am feeling better still—weather fine to day, sunny,
      rather warmish—I am trying to write a very short <em>concluding
         note</em> to the big book<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r5">5</a></sup> but it holds fire, don't suit me—&amp; this is
      all that keeps matters back—but <em>n'importe</em>—we are
      in no way hurry—
   </p> 
   
   <p>Yours came to-day<sup><a href="#loc.07540_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup>—it is indeed queer you don't hear from Wm Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r7">7</a></sup> at all ('twas me I should be uneasy)<sup><a href="#loc.07540_n2" id="r8">8</a></sup>—Tom Harned<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n1" id="r9">9</a></sup> was here last evn'g—Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r10">10</a></sup> too—a good deal ab't the election &amp;
      "politics"—(the whole contest ab't high tariff &amp; free trade is <em>too
         previous</em> &amp; sophomorical at present—too abstract—But it will be a
      great point one of these days)—Whatever is done or happens at present the U S
      will prosper, grow, advance, in the nature of things, these ages—
   </p>
   
   <p><em>Wednesday A M Nov. 7</em>—Don't seem to be defined yet who is elected President—you will
      probably know before this reaches you—Fine weather still—I continue pretty
      well—No Osler<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r11">11</a></sup> for ten days—Ed Wilkins pleases me<sup><a href="#loc.07540_n3" id="r12">12</a></sup>—Did you get the Phil: <em>Times</em> Oct
      27 with a quarter column notice of Nov. B?<sup><a href="#loc.07540_n4" id="r13">13</a></sup>—If not I will send it you—As I write I
      am sitting here as usual in the big chair by the stove—window a little open—every

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07540_n1">1. This letter is addressed:

   <p id="loc.07540_n6">2. The presidential election of
      1888 pitted incumbent Democratic president Grover Cleveland against Republican
      challenger Benjamin Harrison; Harrison lost the popular vote but won the
      electoral college and became the nation's twenty-third president. Tariffs were a
      major issue in the campaign, with Harrison on the side of industry (who wanted
      high tariffs) and Cleveland on the side of consumers (who benefited from low
      tariffs).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">3. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="syr.00024_n3">4. Thomas Donaldson
      (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
      introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
      the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
      carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt
         Whitman, the Man</em> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see
      Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_111.html">Donaldson, Thomas (1843–1898)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">5. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n4284">7. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="loc.07540_n2">8. Gurd, the coinventor of
      the meter, had gone to New York in order to obtain financial backing. On , Bucke complained that Gurd had
      "only written one letter in 2½ weeks." On  Bucke had heard from Gurd—"All is going fine with him and the
      meter."<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="loc.03745_n1">9. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel, was Horace Traubel's
      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4267">10. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="n4302">11. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on

   <p id="loc.07540_n3">12. On , Bucke commented: "I am real glad
      you seem pleased with Ed. W. I knew he would suit you or I would not have sent
      him so far—he was with me here a long time and I know him well—he is
      just what he looks, a good, simple minded, quiet, honest country boy—just
      the kind you like." On , Whitman
      commented to Traubel: "I am coming to see that he is just the man I needed: he
      is my kind: he is young, strong" (see Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.8.html">November 8, 1888</a>).<a href="#r12">[back]
