      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>You were so good as to call yourself so, in my book,—that I value more than you
      guess,—and may I not claim you now?
   </p>
   
   <p>If you received all the letters I write you <u>mentally</u>, you
      would have sufficient kindling for a long Winter. I do even begin them upon paper,
      but words, that I know how to put together, seem so weak against the truth of which I wish to
      speak, that the unfinished letter goes into the waste basket, first torn into inch
      pieces. On yesterday I sent some flowers to speak for me. They know how to talk
      without tiring you. They can speak of divine things without mockery. They can speak
      of tenderness, without annoying you. They can talk with you of "India"—of
      "more than India"—and you will understand each other. I do not know what
      flowers you love best. If I were arranging flowers for your room, I should have
      masses of one kind, if I could. In this case, I thought a few sprays of the more delicate
      miracles, quite a variety of them, might enable you to fancy you had left your room,
      and were picking them as you walked. I wanted to see them put in the box, but the
      kind hearted man who held them in his care assured me they had better remain
      unpacked till just before the express train left Boston. The dear little crocuses
      I
      picked from my own tiny spot of earth, and sent each one laden with
      loving wishes. May they carry their messages safely.
   </p>
   
   <p>I wonder if you have an idea how much I enjoyed being with you—or how hard it
      was for me to leave you.
   </p>
   
   <p>(I worried after leaving, lest I had stayed too long a time and wearied you.) I have
      longed to see you as I never longed to see the Alps. There seemed no prospect of my
      going. The way seemed hedged. Then—a friend opened the gate and let me through. I
      have not called on Mrs. Fairchild<sup><a href="#har.00049_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> yet. I have been too
      busy, but am anticipating the pleasure soon. How good it will be to speak with her
      of you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good bye—good bye—</p>
   
   <p>God bless you ever—ever—!</p>
   
   <p>Sometime America will know what you have done for her. In the meantime, souls, here
      and there, in sorrow<sup><a href="#loc.03950_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> and in gladness, think of you and
      love you.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ada H. Spaulding (b. 1841),
      née Pearsons, was a socialite and active member of various
      reform-movements and women's clubs. She served as the President
      of the Home Club of East Boston and was a member of the Women's Educational
      and Industrial Union. She married Ebenezer Spaulding, an Assistant Surgeon
      during the Civil War, and, later, a homeopathic physician and surgeon who practiced
      in Boston.
      Spaulding read and admired Whitman's poetry, and she wrote the poet
      a number of letters in his final years. For more on Spaulding, see Sherry Ceniza,
      "Women's Letters to Walt 
      Whitman: Some Corrections," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 9 (Winter 1992),

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="har.00049_n3">1. Elizabeth Fairchild was
      the wife of Colonel Charles Fairchild, the president of a paper company, to whom
      Whitman sent the Centennial Edition on March 2, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). He mailed her husband a
      copy of <em>Progress</em> in April, 1881, shortly after his visit
      to Boston, where he probably met the Fairchilds for the first time (Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r1">[back]
