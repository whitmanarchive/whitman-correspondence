      <br></br><br></br>My dear Friend and Guide.       
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Today I have had a note from Ruskin.<sup><a href="#n3013" id="r2">2</a></sup> This is a copy:—
   </p>
   
   <p>'London 3rd April</p>
   
   <p>Dear Riley</p>
   
   <p>Your letter was sent on here. I am very glad to know that I can give some pleasure
      to such a man. I will write to him directly. Send the book to Brantwood' [His residence
      in the 'lake district'] 'All you tell me is more frightful than I care to write of.
   </p>
   
   <p>Ever very Gratefully Yrs</p>
   
   <p>J. Ruskin'</p>                
   
   
   
   <p>You will require a little explanation respecting some parts of the note. When I wrote
      and told him the book had come, I also told him that you had been dismissed from office
      in Washington, and that the American publishers will not publish your works. This
      intense stupidity of the publishers is, I think, the 'frightful' fact of all. <u>I</u> was amazed when I read of the fact. The 'pleasure'
      
      
      I think is the greeting he can give you. He is the most eminent judge of <u>Scripture</u> and painting in Europe, and his stamp upon any work is regarded as being as infallible
      as the 'Goldsmith's Hall' stamp on British gold ware.<sup><a href="#n3014" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>He has no 'publisher,' though he could choose among the whole lot in England. His
      works are published by an old servant, and the price of his books is
      
      
      the same to a 'retail' as to a 'wholesale' buyer—I mean that there is no discount.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>(I am writing very hastily, as I must go out and dig again as soon as possible, as
      the weather is favourable, and the 'season' is late.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I can do little, but something <u>must</u> be done, whilst you are living, to increase the knowledge of your works.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Soon <u>I</u> also must have some photographs, and I think there is no one who
      
      
      so nearly worships you as I do, and nobody who would more willingly stick by you as
      long as we live.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The papers I should have sent, were <u>not</u> sent. Perhaps they will be sent to-day. (They are merely to show you the sort of
      writings I have penned.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope you will be as glad as I am that Ruskin can see, and <u>has</u> seen your meaning.
      
      
      He is a stern critic, and as honest as God—or a tree.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Loving you for your human nature, and reverencing your divine nature.</p>

      I remain yours <u xmlns="">Faithfully</u>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3005">1. William Harrison Riley
      (1835–1907) was a British socialist who addressed Whitman as "My dear
      Friend and Master" in a letter on . Twelve
      years earlier he had found a copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> "and
      saw a Revelation.... In all my troubles and successes I have been strengthened
      by your divine teachings" (<em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin
      Haviland Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1964], 3:148 n17).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3013">2. John Ruskin (1819–1900) was
      one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
      via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
      of ). Ruskin, according to Whitman,
      expressed "<em>worry</em> [...] that [<em>Leaves</em> is] <em>too personal</em>, too emotional,
      launched from the fires of [...] spinal passions, joys, yearnings" (see the
      letter from Whitman to William O'Connor of ). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my
      Ruskin with some qualifications." Still, Ruskin "is not to be made little of: is
      of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.4.html">Thursday, January 24, 1889</a>).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n3014">3. To recieve the 'Goldsmith's Hall'
      stamp, gold had to conform to the standard of at least 18 of gold to 6 of alloy.
      The <em>sterling</em> standard required 22 of gold to 2 of alloy.

      Bradbury, Evans &amp; Co., 1867), 4:1014.<a href="#r3">[back]
