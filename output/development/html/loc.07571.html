   <p>Glad to see you—the doctor prohibits callers nearly altogether—but I suppose
      because they <em>talk</em> too much—wh' I find you do not—but I can only say Hail—&amp; good
      bye—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Little is known about these
      correspondents who seemingly visited Whitman in Camden. Whitman likely wrote
      this note to communicate with his visitors, who could neither hear nor
      speak.
