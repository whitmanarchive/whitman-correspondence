      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>On receipt of your card, to-day, stating the time of your intended start, I
      telegraphed so as to be sure to reach you with word in time. I now give you the
      details. O'Reilly has arranged matters at the Revere
      House, &amp; you are to be a guest there during your
      stay. As I am not now in Boston, but out here (20 miles away), I cannot be at the
      station to meet you, &amp; must therefore ask you
      
      
      to go right to the Revere, where you will be well taken care of. I will come &amp; 
      see you Friday forenoon; not expecting to be in town before then. Etherige I have
      written to but have been too busy to see (having been away in N.Y.), &amp; he will
      doubtless come to see you punctually.
   </p> 
   
   <p>Mrs. John T. Sargent (at whose house the Radical
      or Chestnut Street Club meets) has, I learn, issued cards for an informal reception
      to
      you on Friday at 3 P.M. This you would best go to, unless it will annoy you or in
      any
      way interfere with your comfort in lecturing that evening;                       
      
      
      
      &amp; bear in mind that we expect you around at the St. Botolph after the lecture, &amp; nothing must
      be done which will tire you too much for that.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have sold a fine lot of tickets.</p>
   
   
   <p><u>Au revoir</u> on Friday.
   </p>

      Faithfully yours
