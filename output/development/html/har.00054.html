   <p>I have sent you to-day by ocean mail, a copy of my latest printed <em>Leaves of Grass</em>—not knowing whether you have received the package forwarded for you by a friend<sup><a href="#har.00054_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> of mine last November. I should be well pleased indeed to hear from you. My address

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ferdinand Freiligrath (1810–1876) was a German
      poet and translator and friend of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In his  letter to Rudolf Schmidt, Whitman
      wrote that Freiligrath "translates &amp; commends my poems." His review in the
      Augsburg <em>Allgemeinen Zeitung</em> on April 24, 1868 (reprinted
      in his <em>Gesammelte Dichtungen</em> [Stuttgart: G. J. Göschen,
      1871], 4:86–89), was among the first notices of Whitman's poetry on the
      continent. A translation of the article appeared in the <em>New
         Eclectic Magazine</em>, 2 (July 1868), 325–329; see also Gay Wilson
      Allen, <em>Walt Whitman Abroad</em> (Syracuse: Syracuse University
      Press, 1955), 3–7. A digital version is available in Walter Grünzweig's
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/german/introduction.html">Whitman in the German-Speaking Countries</a>," which collects several
      examples of German reception of Whitman's poetry. Freiligrath had promised his
      readers "some translated specimens of the poet's productions," not a complete
      translation. William D. O'Connor and Whitman were applying pressure. A
      sympathetic article on Whitman in the New York <em>Sontagsblatt</em> of November 1, 1868, mentioned Freiligrath's admiration
      for the American poet. A translation of this article, which Whitman had a
      Washington friend prepare, is now in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="har.00054_n2">1. William D. O'Connor acted as
      emissary between Whitman and Freiligrath. Whitman's  letter to O'Connor indicated that O'Connor had
      provided Whitman with Freiligrath's address, and in his  letter, Whitman asked O'Connor to write a letter to
      Freiligrath to follow a package Whitman sent to Freiligrath on November 11,
      1868.<a href="#r1">[back]
