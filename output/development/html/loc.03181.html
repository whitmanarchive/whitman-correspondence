      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt;
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Last night was my first real attempt at the kind of splurge we have talked about.
      Bust &amp; photo exhibition; clay modeling and talk. I came off at the Presbyterian
      Ch. before the <u>Tuesday</u> Club—I have met nowhere a
      more intelligent company. There were some 200 present. I began by a ten minute
      reading as a sort of <u>"prayer"</u> or <u>prelude,</u> &amp; then turned to my clay &amp; modeled &amp; talked for a
      half or three quarters of an hour, producing a tolerably good head of old John
      Brown.<sup><a href="#n3169" id="r1">1</a></sup>
       I was able to
      keep up a continuous interest. Then I explained casting in plaster, &amp; the
      reproduction in marble. Then I drew some chalk pictures on blackboard, &amp; gave
      some reminiscinces of Emerson,<sup><a href="#n1044" id="r2">2</a></sup> yourself &amp; Dr. Holmes.<sup><a href="#n3024" id="r3">3</a></sup> I had your photos there—&amp; many others, with my busts
      of Hicks,<sup><a href="#n0301" id="r4">4</a></sup> Sumner,<sup><a href="#n0606" id="r5">5</a></sup> Emerson, &amp; my little
      head of mother—We kept up the business till near ten o'clock. I guess it was a
      <u>success.</u> At all events, the <u>thanks</u> were profuse and hearty. Several ministers were there &amp; in
      perfectly  good
      humor. I now feel sure I can make this sort of thing <u>all</u>
      over the country. But I want to reduce the bust exhibition business to a magic
      lantern performance. It will not be so picturesque, but more convenient, &amp; much
      less expensive. It would cost like sin to tote several large busts about the
      country. I wish I had photos of my big busts of you &amp; of the statuette,
      negatives small size fit for stereopticon. I <u>must</u> have
      them some way. Next Sunday's Register will print my opening remarks &amp; give a
      account of the evening  I shall send you a copy.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am worried about Harned.<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n1" id="r6">6</a></sup> Horace<sup><a href="#n3041" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      just wrote me a word &amp; sent the <u>Posts</u> two weeks ago,
      &amp; that's all I've heard. I hope the affair has not been serious.
   </p>
   
   <p>And I hope you are comfortable. I should like to stop in &amp; see you all. I'm
      trying to get the Hicks bust plastered before sending. Will send it by 1st of next
      week. I rather wanted to make the most of it here, &amp; so have delayed. What about
      the lecture for the <u>Fidelity</u>?
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Kind regards to Mrs. D.<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n6113" id="r8">8</a></sup> Let her read this
      &amp;
      <br></br>Yours ever,
      <br></br>Morse

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3169">1. The famous abolitionist John Brown
      (1800–1859) began pursuing a violent guerilla war against slavery in
      Kansas and Missouri in 1856. In October 1859, Brown stormed a federal armory at
      Harper's Ferry but was captured by marines under the command of Robert E. Lee.
      Brown's execution ten days later transformed him into a martyr for the
      abolitionist cause (see Robert McGlone, "John Brown," <em>American
         National Biography Online</em>).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1044">2. Ralph Waldo Emerson
      (1803–1882) was an American poet and essayist who began the
      Transcendentalist movement with his 1836 essay <em>Nature</em>.
      For more on Emerson, see Jerome Loving, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_1.html">Emerson, Ralph Waldo [1809–1882]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3024">3. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.
      (1809–1894) was a Bostonian author, physician, and lecturer. One of the
      Fireside Poets, he was a good friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson as well as John
      Burroughs. Towards Whitman's poetry, Holmes remained ambivalent. He married
      Amelia Lee Jackson in 1840 and they had three children, including the later
      Supreme Court judge Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. For more information, see
      "Holmes, Oliver Wendell (1809-1894)," (<em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, eds. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 280).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0301">4. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker from Long
      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his
      influence on Whitman, see David S. Reynolds, <em>Walt Whitman's
         America</em> (New York: Knopf, 1995), 37–39.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0606">5. Charles Sumner (1811–1874), a Massachusetts
      politician, was most famous for being beaten unconscious on the Senate floor by
      South Carolinian Preston Brooks, who was outraged by Sumner's denouncing the
      Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1856. Sumner would go on to be an influential member of
      the Senate's Radical Republicans during the Civil War and Reconstruction. He
      died of a heart attack on March 11, 1874.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03745_n1">6. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel, was Horace Traubel's
      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3041">7. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was a close acquaintance of Walt Whitman and one of the poet's literary
      executors. He met Whitman in 1873 and proceeded to visit the aging author almost
      daily beginning in mid-1880s. The result of these meetings—during which
      Traubel took meticulous notes—is the nine-volume collection <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/index.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em>. Later in life, Traubel also
      published Whitmanesque poetry and revolutionary essays. He died in 1919, shortly
      after he claimed to have seen a vision of Whitman beckoning him to 'Come on'.
      For more on Traubel, see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. (1858–1919)</a>, <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, ed., (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 740–741.<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="n6113">8. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
