   <p>I send you the Carlyle piece as requested<sup><a href="#nyp.00422_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Mail me a
      proof, if possible—if Tuesday forenoon I can return it Tuesday night—If
      not possible pray read proof with extra care by copy—It ought to make just a
      page—I want without fail fifty impressions of just that page. It can easily be
      done in the printing office—Another thing I forget to mention before (&amp;
      perhaps is not strictly needed any how) I reserve the right to print any of my
      pieces in future book—&amp; to make it clearer, would you &amp; J B<sup><a href="#nyp.00422_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> kindly, after signing, return to me the accompanying
      page?
