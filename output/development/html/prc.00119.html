   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Robert Collyer
      (1823–1912) was born in Yorkshire, England, and emigrated to the United
      States in 1837. He became a lay minister in the Methodist church but later
      converted to Unitarianism and preached at various churches in Chicago. Collyer
      took over the ministry of the Unitarian Church of the Messiah in New York in
      1879. In 1888, Walt Whitman described to Horace Traubel an argument in which
      Collyer got the better of him, conceding "Collyer's not deep but he's damned
      cute" and summarized him as "a kind of reduced Beecher—a Beecher with much
      of the grace lopped off" (Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em> [1906-1964], <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.41.html">Tuesday, May 8, 1888.</a>).
