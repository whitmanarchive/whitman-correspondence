      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sister
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been quite unwell, a bad spell with my head, worse than usual, nine or ten
      days—I kept up, but had no comfort—the last two days it is easier, &amp;
      it is passing over apparently, for the present<sup><a href="#mhs.00017_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Lou I think I would like to have you or George put up my letters (not the books or
      papers) in a package, &amp; send them to me here, 2316 Pine street,—if it 
      dont
      
       make too big a package, <u>send by mail</u>, (postage will
      be 6 cts an ounce by mail)—(or if George thinks best, send by
      express—that is if the parcel is too big)—please do it soon as
      convenient—there is brown wrapping-paper &amp; string in my room—I shall stay
      here perhaps two weeks longer—It is very hot here for this season, indeed as
      hot as we had it in July there in Camden—I go out most every day, Jeff has
      taken me out riding very often, &amp; I have been everywhere within several miles,
      &amp; in all the outer parts of the City which are the roomiest &amp; the
      pleasantest by far of any city I have ever seen—Jeff is very kind indeed,
      &amp; I am agreeably fixed here—&amp; since I am here so far, &amp; shall
      probably never come again, I have concluded to stay awhile—The girls are well
      &amp; hearty &amp; send their love—Hatty is down stairs piano-practising as I
      write—I have not written any thing for publication yet here, as I have not
      felt well, but I want to, before I leave, as this trip is a great revelation,
      especially the Colorado journey, &amp; the mountains—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Lou your letter was 
      rec'd, &amp; very glad to get it—Write again soon after receiving
      this—I have written to Hannah<sup><a href="#mhs.00017_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and Mary<sup><a href="#mhs.00017_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> from here—I have just written to the Camden post
      office to send my letters on here for the present—Lou this is a wonderful,
      wonderful country, &amp; the richest city upon the whole (thousands and
      thousands of fine comfortable 5 or $6000 well built brick or stone houses, with
      gardens around them) &amp; streets ahead of Chestnut st<sup><a href="#mhs.00017_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      &amp; more crowded, &amp;c &amp;c—but there are just <u>two things</u> here you &amp;
      I 
      w'd
      
       never get used to, &amp; would spoil all,—that is the air you breathe is
      always tainted with coal smoke &amp; pungent gas—&amp; a perpetual dust &amp;
      smut &amp; little black motes, that forever smut your clothes &amp; hands &amp;
      face, all the time, night &amp; day—So you see there are always some bad
      points, even to the greatest &amp; best—But the folks here don't seem to mind
      it, or think it is any thing<sup><a href="#mhs.00017_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      So good bye for the present Lou dear &amp; love to all—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="mhs.00017_n1">1. Whitman had a serious
      relapse while he was in the West, and was not able to return to Camden until
      early in January, 1880.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="mhs.00017_n2">2. On , Hannah Heyde had written a letter to Whitman, in
      which she expressed her concern that her husband Charles had written with
      negative things to say about her. She insisted that he "cannot or does not say
      <em>one word of truth</em>." Charles Heyde was infamous among
      the Whitman family for his querulous letters and his bad treatment of
      Hannah.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="mhs.00017_n3">3. Though Whitman wrote
      several times a year to Mary Cabot and never failed to send her a Christmas
      gift, usually $5, few of his letters to her are extant, and only two of her
      letters are known. See <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections</em>,
      ed. Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver (Durham: Duke University Press, 1949),
      207–208; Appendix C, December 23, 1883 (Yale Collection of American
      Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="mhs.00017_n4">4. Chestnut Street in
      Philadelphia.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="mhs.00017_n5">5. In <em>Specimen Days</em> Whitman made no references to these liabilities (ed.
      Floyd Stovall [New York: New York University Press, 1963], 228).<a href="#r5">[back]
