      From H. L. Traubel
      <br></br>Camden,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">July 3, '79
      
      <br></br><br></br>To W.W
      <br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I'll write you a few
      words again—for this warm weather
      enough of a "plentiful suffering" to
      tax your patience, I doubt not.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>When I read in the
      last <u>Index</u> of you having spoken on
      Garrison at the [illegible] Memorial I was
      warmly curious to know what you could 
      have said. My curiosity has not abated by
      one jot and I would esteem it a favor
      if you would let me know at
      least the <u>substance</u> of your matter.
      Was it published? If not you ought
      send it to the <u>Index</u>: at this I would
      be overjoyed, for I could then see &amp;
      appreciate it without putting you
      to any trouble. Will you do so if it has
      not already been printed?
      
   </p>
   
   <p>About your mail here
      (or in Philadelphia), I am not forgetful. In
      
      this delightful weather I think so often of the
      pleasurable walks and chats we could have
      in the Park if you were only here to make
      the second party! Must I ever hope against
      hope? Fiddlesticks and gridirons! what a
      little deceiver hope <u>can</u> be! Yet, <u>will</u> you
      come? I yearn along in a devil-care sort
      of a way for that lecture from you, &amp;
      those keen bits of wisdom, and a trifle of
      your sarcasm. But if I even think all
      this, I do not for a twitch forget that you
      owe me nothing—no such pleasure or gratification—and
      that if it ever really comes, I am the
      lucky dog and you the Sir Beneficence. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>On the hour-cars the
      other night I fell in with an ex-professor
      of a theological seminary somewhere out
      of Philadelphia. We talked a long while. I 
      quizzed and he discoursed. This lasted well nigh
      an hour, and at last, when his religious questions
      got more personal, I had to let out that I
      was a pagan. He looked askance and a trifle
      
      stern with brows drawn, but I speedily taxed his
      toleration and he relaxed. Finally he went
      his way and I mine—and the Sagacious 
      Unknowable himself but knows when we'll
      meet again! Still, I found the man very
      tolerant—as befits a reader of Goethe, Schiller
      Lessing and his royal brothers-in-Truth—and
      the conversation may last in memory.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have waded through another novel—Charles
      Reade's "It's never too late to mind."
      Excepting a chapter here and there, I do
      not fancy it much. My bias is for Dickens.
      I like a good [
      <span class="unclear">aim?</span>]
       of pathos in a novel—nothing
      maudlin but all natural. I think Dickens
      supplies this about as good as the next. William
      Black is good, usually, in the respect, though apt
      to overdo. It always seems to me that
      only a hard-headed man can read, for a 
      case, in "David Copperfield," Pegotty's account
      of his search on the Continent
      for Little Emily—without tearful eyes.
      To think of it alone often makes me sad—makes me anxious in a way that does me good. I think I could almost like the poet
      Gray, live in an atmosphere of novels forever—devour them, figuratively speaking.
      'Tisn't the solidest food at all times, and I ought not thus exaggerate; but I have
      a sincere passion for the best among them, and can't honestly deny it. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>When you write I would like to have you tell me about that Goethe-Schiller matter.
      I think I referred to it in one of my last letters.
   </p>

      Write soon!
      <br></br>Yours hastily,
      <br></br>H. L. T.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>My regards to —— those [illegible]: Emerson, Whitman, Major [
