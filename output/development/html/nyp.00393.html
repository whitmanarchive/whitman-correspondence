      Albert G. Knapp to WW, 
      Rochester,
      April 2, 1876
      <br></br><br></br>D[ear] Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Early in the year 1863—I think in the final month—I lay on a cot in Mother Whippy's
      Ward at Judiciary Sqre Hospt.in Washington D.C. sick "Nigh unto death" when there came in one day, with charitable
      intent, a stalwart man of genial appearance &amp; seemingly past the middle age since
      his hair &amp; face beard were plentifully sprinkled with white. This man (whose frame,
      as I afterward found, was no mean type of the generous heart within) came to my bed,
      sat down, &amp; after some talk with me wrote a letter to my parents in Michigan. This
      act secured my gratitude &amp; we became intimately acquainted &amp; close friends—Being furloughed
      in July '63 &amp; discharged while in Mich. I lost sight of my friend &amp; I am not sure that I even heard of him until I returned
      in '64 with an ugly bullet hole through my left lung that time finding a lodgment
      at Armory Sqr. Hospt..
   </p>
   
   <p>My friend was still in Washington, we met, &amp; our intimacy was renewed and again abruptly
      broken off in the summer of '65 when I was transferred to New Haven &amp; soon afterward
      discharged from the service. Although I have never since heard a word from my quondam
      friend, still the name Walt Whitman is a household one in our family &amp; the picture
      (by Schaff) with the autograph, Walt Whitman 1863 written in pencil in the margin
      to the right is lying here on the table having been brought down stairs a little while
      ago to be compared with one which appears in Leslie's for April 8th &amp; which I brought
      up Friday with the Sunday N.Y. papers.
   </p>
   
   <p>The question that naturally comes to us now is this, Is <em>this</em> Walt Whitman,—"the Poet of health &amp; strength," <em>our</em> Walt Whitman of old? Everybody who has seen the two pictures says they are of the
      same man—If it indeed be true, I am very glad for I shall, I know, hear from my old
      friend—I am married, live here, (my mother living with us) &amp; have charge of one of
      the public schools (No. 13) of the city.
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall take a lively interest in the arrival of the postman for some time hereafter
      in the hope that I am what the rest so confidently assert:
   </p>
