      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Here you are! Good, too! I managed to get down to the Congressional this morning,
      and copied the 
      enclosed from the Areopagitica. I think it makes a capital epigraph.
   </p>
   
   
   <p> It will add force to the argument to print it as I have copied it, with the full
      title of the treatise
      appended, since "unlicensed printing" is the subject of our story. I think you will
      agree that the passage
      fits the case also in other ways, and I hope you will like it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Winter has a characteristic dirty squib in today's Tribune anent of Doctor Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r1">1</a></sup> book. I hope the 
      dose I have given him in the Introductory may be appreciated by him. Goodbye. Faithfully
   </p>

   <p>[Enclosure] "As good almost kill a man as kill a good book; who kills a man kills
      a reasonable creature, God's image; but he who 
      destroys a good book, kills reason itself, kills the image of God, as it were in the
      eye. Many a man lives a burden to the earth, but a 
      good book is the precious lifeblood of a master-spirit embalmed and treasured 
      up on purpose, to a life beyond life. 'Tis true no age can restore a life, whereof
      perhaps there is no great loss; but revolutions of ages 
      do not oft recover the loss of a rejected truth, for the want of which all nations
      fare the worse. We should be wary, therefore, what 
      persecution we raise against the living labors of public men; how we spill that seasoned
      life of man preserved and stored up in books,
      since we see a kind of homicide may be thus committed, sometimes a martyrdom."
   </p>
   
   
   <p> W. exclaimed: "That should be carved over the door of every library, every publishing
      house, every public place whatsoever:
      children should be taught it: grown-up people should be forced to remember it: it
      is precious, sacred, everlasting: William was right:
      it fits our case, our struggles against adversity: few people know what we have had
      to go through to get even where we are today—
      which is none too far. Horace,<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r2">2</a></sup> read it again before you stick it in your pocket." I did so. He exclaimed "Amen!
      Amen!" when I was 
      through.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
