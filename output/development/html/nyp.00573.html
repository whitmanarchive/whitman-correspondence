      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The $16.50 on acc't of photo. sales, came safely to hand &amp; this is the
      receipt—with best thanks—
   </p>
   
   <p>Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> hurried off, &amp; I did not have a chance to
      mention to him ab't the London agency for the photos. I should suggest however the
      selection of some established shop or name in London as the best place—some
      place where such things are in their line—
   </p>
   
   <p>I like best Nos. 3, 6 and 8 of the photos. Would send those only—</p>
   
   <p>Am ab't as usual—</p>
