   <p id="med.00442_n2">2. Although the New York <em>Tribune</em> had printed Whitman's review of his own books
      earlier in the year (see Whitman's  letter to Whitelaw Reid) as well as sympathetic reports on
      January 29 and February 25, 1876, and excerpts from <em>Two
         Rivulets</em> on March 1, 1876, the newspaper, probably through the
      influence of Bayard Taylor (see Whitman's , to Taylor), began to publish hostile notices. On March 28, 1876,
      the London correspondent assailed Buchanan's article in the London <em>Daily News</em>. An editorial on March 30, 1876, also attacked
      the recklessness of Buchanan's charges, and maintained that Whitman failed to
      save money from his Washington days, "the cause thereof was certainly not
      'persecution.' " Another hostile editorial appeared on April 12, 1876.
      Burroughs' defense was published on April 13, 1876. On April 22, 1876, O'Connor,
      Walt Whitman's estranged friend, wrote an extravagant, and garrulous, encomium.
      Later the <em>Tribune</em> resumed its friendly attitude toward
      Walt Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="med.00442_n3">3. Franklin B. Sanborn
      (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
      he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
      the U.S. Senate, Walt Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
      reviewed <em>Drum-Taps</em> in the Boston <em>Commonwealth</em> on February 24, 1866 (Miller, <em>Drum-Taps</em>, lviii). He was editor of the Springfield <em>Republican</em> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
      his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
      appeared without Sanborn's name in the Springfield <em>Republican</em> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K.
      Walker, "Sanborn, Franklin Benjamin (Frank) (1831–1917)," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
