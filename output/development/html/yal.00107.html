      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you saw my letter to William O'Connor, a week since, with notice of my safe
      arrival home, &amp; account of one thing &amp; another up to that date. I have
      called at the American News Company store. They have not sold many of the
      Notes—not more than a hundred. It seems to be well-known, however, &amp; often
      talked about. I have procured &amp; given Henry Clapp
      
      a copy, at his particular request. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have seen F. P. Church, who treated me with great courtesy—he was anxious
      about the article on <em>Democracy</em>—wishes to have it for
      the December number—said he would publish the little piece <em>Ethiopia Commenting</em><sup><a href="#yal.00107_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—but thought it best to keep it back till after the Democracy article
      had appeared.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have not done anything further to the latter-named piece—but shall try to
      have it ready in time for the December number. I think it likely I shall return last
      of this week to Washington. I have not received any letter at all from Washington.
      H. J. Raymond<sup><a href="#yal.00107_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> is home from Europe.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Give my best respects to Mrs. Burroughs—as I am coming back so soon, I will
      mention then what I have to say on the shirt question. I am living at 1194 Atlantic
      st. opposite Hamilton street. There is nothing specially new or important among my
      folks—they all wish me to give their best regards to you.
   </p>
