      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received a few days since your last letter. It is very pleasant to me to find you
      liked my 
      Shakspere
      
       book, but much more to know that you are not indifferent to me, myself,
      &amp; do not think of me as a stranger.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The report of your health makes us both hopeful &amp; anxious. I do not know whether
      your American Summers are as health–bringing as our Summers, but I should
      suppose they have a decided advantage over your winters in this respect
      (notwithstanding all John Burroughs says of Winter Sunshine) for an invalid; so it
      is chiefly from the summer that we shall look for an advance towards recovery
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>The newspaper statement of the attitude of the American public towards you is a
      surprise &amp; a disappointment
   </p>
   
   <p>We had been misled by a correspondent of <u>The Academy</u>, which
      is a paper always friendly to you, into quite a different view of things—I am
      waiting until next Saturday to see whether Rossetti has
      inserted this statement in the Academy. If he has not, I will write to him &amp; try
      to get it printed there.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Two friends, Professor Atkinson of 
      Trin. Coll.
      
       Dublin, &amp; Stoker, who writes to you, have asked me to get copies of
      your <u>Three</u> volumes, 
      L of G
      
      , Two Rivulets &amp; Memoranda. But I do not doubt that half–a dozen
      of my friends will wish to have the  books, so I should be obliged if you would send a parcel
      containing six copies of Each book—the Authograph 1876–Edition. Stoker
      wishes me to ask you to put, if you do not object, his name (Abraham Stoker) &amp;
      your own in the copies for him&amp;
   </p>
   
   
   <p>He has told you perhaps of a very lively debate we had at our "Fortnightly Club" on
      "The genius of Walt Whitman" last Monday Evening 
      Feb
      
       14 <u>th</u> A most savage,
      but ill–planned, attack opened the discussion. I followed with a speech which
      consisted in the main of apt selections from 
      L. of G.
      
       &amp; Democratic Vistas, &amp; these were felt by my hearers to be a very
      effective answer to the previous speaker's extravagant statements. Men, to my
      surprise &amp; great satisfaction, followed speaker  after speaker on the Whitman
      side,—a barrister, a young clergyman, a man in business, &amp; others, while
      the remaining speakers were three, one who placed you below Victor Hugo on the
      ground of alleged deficiency of <u>form</u> &amp; beauty in your
      poems, one who announced that he had never read your books but was sure you could
      have written nothing as good as Burns' "Cotter's Saturday Night", &amp; a third
      recently introduced to 
      L. of G.
      
       &amp; who confessed to having discovered some few great poems, but much
      that baffled him, &amp; that should be challenged.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The result was on the whole highly satisfactory. It was the 2nd Evening occupied by you during the present session.</p>
   
   
   <p>These little skirmishes, however, are only occasional incidents in the quiet progress
      which as I said before I am  convinced your writings are making.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was very glad to hear of Burroughs. I still owe him a letter of thanks for his <u>Winter Sunshine.</u></p>
   
   
   <p>I Enclose a draft for the Equivalent of <u>sixty dollars</u>.
      Please send the parcel to me at the following address
      
      <br><br>Winstead
      <br>Temple Road,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Rathmines.
      <br>Dublin.
      
      And now, dear friend, goodbye. Be sure that any tidings of you, good or the reverse
      of good, will always be of great concern to me, &amp; write a line when it suits
      you, but at no other time.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours always,
      <br></br>Edward Dowden
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>P.S. If you have any Magazine articles why not try <u>The
         Gentlemans Magazine</u>—if a poem, or—better—if prose <u>The Fortnightly Review</u>?
   </p>
   
   <p>But have a 2<u>nd</u>hi&gt; copy of
      the MS made to avoid the risk of its being lost—
   </p>
   
   <p>I strongly incline to think Morley of the Fortnightly Review would be glad to
      hear from you, if you have anything suitable.
   </p>
   
   <p>It also occurs to me that some arrangement might be come to with 
      Messrs
      
       Chatto &amp; Windus to publish your Two Rivulets &amp;c., &amp; give
      you a royalty on copies sold. I will writ to Rossetti about this.

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>).

      Garland Publishing, 1998).
