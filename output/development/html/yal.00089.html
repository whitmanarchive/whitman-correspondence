   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00089_n2">1. Lewis Kirke Brown
      (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
      August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
      transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in
      February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on
      February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come
      and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on
      January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary
      (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was employed in the
      Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's letter from 
      . The following
      September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief
      of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until his retirement
      in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was prepared by Brown's
      family and is now held in the Library of Congress.)<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="yal.00089_n3">2. Mary Felton, a nurse in
      Armory Square Hospital, was the daughter of Harvard president Cornelius Conway
      Felton, who had died on February 26, 1862. At the close of the war, she helped
      organize the Howard Industrial School, a trade school in Cambridge aimed at
      training former slaves into industrial jobs in the North.<a href="#r2">[back]
