      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>In your letter to Mother you say that you have written a letter to the Eagle and want
      me when it is publis[hed] to send you some copies.<sup><a href="#loc.00411_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I have neglected writing you thinking every day that it would appear and that I would
      be able to advise you that I had sent them (Eagles) and the pictures as you wanted.
      I now begin to think that it will hardly be printed but still I will keep a lookout
      for it and if it does will send them to you at once. Do you wish me to send the pictures
      without the papers?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00411_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> received your letter on Thursday morning and sent you $5. the same day and to day
      he sent you $6 more. I should not wonder if we were able to drop you a few $ every
      now and then, right along &nbsp;I hope so any way. Everything is going on finely at home.
      Mother is quite well and Mat is as usual well and hard at work. Sis is growing like
      a weed and as wild as a hawk. To day Mat happened to look out in front and found her
      trying by force of arms, to drive a little boy, bigger than she was however, off the
      front stoop. They say that she was wonderfull indignat at being stopped. She seems to remember you and is very anxious that I should always
      remember to write you that she has been a nice girl
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We do not hear much from George. I suppose that he is farther away from mail communication
      than he has been heretofore. In his last letter he seemed to be glad to get away from
      Va.<sup><a href="#loc.00411_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> and I dont blame him. Andrew, I think, is getting better, slowly, I dont think that he takes very good care of himself even yet. If he would I am sure that
      he would get better rapidly &nbsp;We have not heard from Han since the letter that I sent
      you, I suppose she is about the same &nbsp;Mother speaks of sending for her &amp;c and then
      says she hardly knows what to do. Tis rather a puzzling question I confess. I hope
      however that she will come home herself before long. It certainly is a great relief
      not to be cursed with letters from Heyde every few days.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose, dear Walt that you will have more to do in the Hospitals than ever pretty
      soon. I hardly can see how you can stand seeing so much of the heart-breaking &nbsp;I certainly
      could not do it. I am sure it would make me sick enough to die. Last Thursday I met
      Bill Hart.<sup><a href="#loc.00411_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> He is Major in the 88th N. Y. V. and had been hurt at Kelleys ford. He seemed very
      glad to see me and said had he known that you were in Washington he certainly should
      have seen you before this. I gave him your address and he will call on you when he
      goes through Washington on his return. He looks better than he did when he used to
      be around Brooklyn. Monday A. M. &nbsp;Yesterday Andrew was at the house &nbsp;he, I think,
      is somewhat better. Everybody else is getting along as usual, and all send their love.
      Write.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00411_n1">1. Walt Whitman's letter
      never appeared in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>. Edwin
      Haviland Miller thinks it was eventually submitted to the <em>Brooklyn Daily Union</em> (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:105 and 1:95, n.3). In addition to requesting ten copies of the <em>Daily Eagle</em>, Walt asked Jeff in a letter dated  for "5 more of my pictures, (the big
      ones in the last edition 'Leaves'), &amp; a couple of the photographs carte
      visites (the smaller
      ones,)."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00411_n2">2. Moses Lane
      (1823–82) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00411_n3">3. On , George wrote Jeff, "Kentucky is the
      most beautiful country I ever saw, the people seem much more inteligent, and
      every way better, than in any other part of the South I have ever been. I like
      Ky first rate…there is none of that devilish, Virginia mud to travell
      through."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00411_n4">4. William G. Hart, a
      captain and acting assistant adjutant general in Company K of the Eighty-eighth
      New York Volunteers, suffered a gunshot wound in the right forearm on December
      13, 1862, and was granted twenty days sick leave on December 15. Recently
      promoted to major, William G. Hart was granted several leaves of absence from
      March 2, 1863, through June 1863. He had received a spinal injury at Kelly's
      Ford, a camp near Falmouth, Virginia.<a href="#r4">[back]
