      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thank you for the papers sent the other day. I sent you one yesterday, with various
      opinions on immortality. I [illegible]
      Davidson says one of the strongest proofs is that we can't prove it!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How comes on the preface to the stories? is it nearly done, or not begun, or how?
      or
      am I "too previous" in assuming that you are doing, or to do it? I only know what Dr.
      Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r1">1</a></sup> wrote me, as I have not heard from you on the subject
      at all. My plan is, &amp; do you like it? My plan is to put the <u>six</u> published stories, &amp; the new one, "The Brazen Android" in one
      volume,—with the sketch or preface, or whatever you may think best, &amp; feel
      to do. Then you know that Appleton proposed to publish the "Carpenter" as an illustrated story
      for the next Christmas, &amp; Dr. Bucke says the illustration must be a picture of
      <u>you</u>. I hope that the death of O. B. [
      <span class="unclear">Burce?</span>]
       has not changed the
      plan, he was the one who had it in hand. You know dear Walt, that they begin early
      to get up the books for Christmas, &amp; I want to have the volume out early, &amp;
      am having "The Brazen Android" put in type now, by a typewriter, as there was but just the one
      copy in the world; &amp; I would not risk that in the mail. So, if you are in the
      mood, I shall be very glad of your part as early as you can let one have it, if I
      am
      to have it; which is for you to say. I have told you what a great help it will be
      to
      me in many ways, so shall not enlarge upon that now. I feel that <u>you</u>, &amp; <u>you only</u>, are the one person in all the
      world to say the right thing about William O'Connor.<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>If you have any suggestions to make about the volume I shall be very glad of them,
      for I feel that I am &amp; have been very much working in the dark. If you feel like
      it, I should like you to confer with Horace Traubel,<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; see
      if he likes the plan of republishing in one volume.
   </p>
   
   <p>How are you these hot
      days? We have had it very hot, an old fashioned June.
   </p>
   
   <p>In some weeks I had two school girls with me, &amp; we went out several times in the
      evening &amp; took long horsecar rides; &amp; it brought back to mind the old days
      when you &amp; William, little Jeannie,<sup><a href="#n4138" id="r4">4</a></sup> Charles Eldridge<sup><a href="#n0210" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; I used to go in the same way. I am alone again, but not
      for long, I
      think.
   </p>
   
   <p>I enjoyed the visit from Dr. Bucke much.</p>
   
   <p>I wish I could see you—</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4138">4. Jean was the daughter of William D.
      and Ellen O'Connor. William speaks often in his letters of Jean, calling her by
      her nicknames of "Jenny" or "Jeannie."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0210">5. Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
