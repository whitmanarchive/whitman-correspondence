      breakfast) it has been very hot here and so
      much cloudy unwholsome  weather i have felt

      but these two or three mornings back i have
      felt better) george<sup><a href="#duk.00556_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> has not been home since i

      hey haveent  he says he has to work real hard
      out there so many pipe to handle but he feels
      pretty well has a good appetite he says he has
      the rheumatis in his legs and hip i dont  think
      its the rheumatis<sup><a href="#duk.00414_n14" id="r4">4</a></sup> at all i think its the affects
      of his fever when he was a prisoner in the war<sup><a href="#duk.00581_n22" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      
      well walt i have had a letter from

      along finely matty sent me two 25 cent bills<sup><a href="#duk.00581_n12" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      quite a lift wasent  it walt well walt i dont  want
      to complain of any body but i doo  think sometimes
      they might send me a few dollars but to send
      50 cents i thought it rather small when i think
      of what i have done for them i dont  think
      i would be indebted if they was to
      send me considerable) Jeff<sup><a href="#duk.00422_n2" id="r8">8</a></sup> sent a letter to
      George after he left for camden  wanted an
      immediate answer) now walt i will tell you
      all about the affairs between george and jeff
      i think you will understand it in the first place
      jeff let george have 500 dollars<sup><a href="#duk.00581_n15" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      george gave him a note
      forit and then he let him have 500 hund more he gave him
      a note for that that made 1000 dollars one was given 
      last august  and the other last september  and when
      matt was on here
      george lent her 50 dollars<sup><a href="#duk.00581_n14" id="r10">10</a></sup> she told
      jeff to pay george but he dident  so george thought
      it could go to pay the interest of the notes or toward
      it) when jeff was on i said to him couldent  he
      let george have what money he would want to
      build with and take a mortgage on this house i
      thought it would be an advantage to jeff as well
      as george so he asked george how much he would
      want and george told him three thousand dollars
      jeff said he would let him know when he went
      back and george said when the other house was
      sold he would pay off the two notes and only 
      have the three thousand stand well jeff sent
      drafts at different times till he had sent it all
      but 600 dollars<sup><a href="#duk.00581_n4" id="r11">11</a></sup>
      that was to make out the mortgage
      you see walt and then he stopped dident  send
      any more finally the mortgage was made out
      and executed and left at the recorders office
      and six hundred wasent  received so when george
      was home he said that six hundred he should
      keep to pay you<sup><a href="#duk.00581_n13" id="r12">12</a></sup> 
      and when the house was sold
      he should have some coming and would make
      up enoughf  to pay off the notes to jeff) well this
      letter to george was to see if george couldent  pay
      the notes off as  jeffy wanted to go into some speclulation 
      in an iron furnace manufactory but he said for
      george to not sell the house by any means
      so i wrote a letter to him that george was away
      
      and would be home in 2 weeks and that he
      had transfered the 1000 dollar mortgage on the
      steers property to the mason that done the work)<sup><a href="#duk.00515_n4" id="r13">13</a></sup> jeff
      wrote to know if george held that mortgage yet
      so i dont  know how it go)
      if you cant  understand
      walter dear you must read it over two or three
      times)<sup><a href="#duk.00581_n5" id="r14">14</a></sup> when matt wrote to me she generally
      asks how walt is and they would like to have
      you come on there well i dare say they would

      sends edd<sup><a href="#duk.00425_n13" id="r15">15</a></sup> and me our daily substance i
      thought afterwards maybe they would think
      it was a hint to them but i thought i dident  care

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00581_n11">1. This letter dates to June
      23, 1869. June 23, the date in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, fell on a
      Wednesday in 1869, the year assigned to the letter by Richard Maurice Bucke. In
      the letter, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote that John Burroughs had visited her
      "yesterday tuesday." Edwin Haviland Miller cited Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:367). Louisa's summary of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's
      loans to George Washington Whitman—he received the first loan of $500
      "last august"—is consistent with Jeff Whitman's  letter to George and further confirms the year of
      Louisa's letter as 1869.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00581_n1">2. John Burroughs was one of
      Walt Whitman's closest friends in Washington. The "friend" that accompanied
      Burroughs is not known. See <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">"Burroughs, John (1837–1921) and Ursula
         (1836–1917)."</a><a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n3">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00414_n14">4. Rheumatism or arthritic
      rheumatism, which Louisa Van Velsor Whitman also spells "rheumattis" or
      "rhumatis," is joint pain, which was attributed to dry joints. See <em>Health at Home, or Hall's Family Doctor</em> (Hartford: J. A.
      S. Betts, 1873), 704.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00581_n7">6. The letter is not extant.
      Martha Mitchell Whitman (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of
      Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two
      daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved
      to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead
      to her death in February 1873. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed.,
      <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New
      York: New York University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="duk.00581_n12">7. The United States issued
      fractional currency during the Civil War, which was known as Postal Currency
      because the designs copied postage stamps. Various issues continued in
      circulation until the mid-1870s. See Arthur L. Friedberg and Ira S. Friedberg,
      <em>Paper Money of the United States: A Complete Illustrated
         Guide With Valuations</em>, 18th ed., (Clifton, New Jersey: Coin &amp;

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">8. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="duk.00581_n15">9. For Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's initial $500 loan to George Washington Whitman, see Jeff's  letter to George.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00581_n14">10. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman began an extended visit to Brooklyn for medical treatment in mid-October
      1868 (see Walt Whitman's  letter
      to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman). Mattie and Jeff returned to St. Louis in
      mid-December. For the $50 that George Washington Whitman lent Mattie, see Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's 
      letter to Walt.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00581_n4">11. The meaning of "all but 600
      dollars" is that George had received from Jeff the two $500 loans plus $2400 in
      exchange for the mortgage valued at "three thousand dollars." Also see Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's  letter for the
      mortgage made out to Thomas Jefferson Whitman.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00581_n13">12. In mid-March 1869 Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman had asked Walt to lend George $600, and Walt apparently
      agreed (see Mrs. Whitman's  letter
      to Walt; see Jeff Whitman's  letter
      to Walt).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00515_n4">13. Margret Steers, her husband
      Thomas Steers (1826–1869), and their four children Thomas (b. 1853),
      Caroline (b. 1857), Louisa (b. 1862), and Margret (b. 1865) moved into the
      Atlantic Avenue building in November 1868. Thomas Steers operated a bakery, and
      his wife, who would become a close friend of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,
      continued the business when he died in January 1869. After Thomas Steers' sudden
      death, Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman replied to an early 1869 letter from
      Louisa (not extant) with concern that "Mr. Steers' death had quite an effect on
      you." George Washington Whitman sold a property to Margaret Steers in January
      1871, and the property had title trouble with regard to unpaid assessments (see
      Mattie Whitman's February? 1869 letter to Louisa in Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1977], 67; Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman; "Died,"
      <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, January 22, 1869, 3; <em>United States Census, 1870</em>. New York, Brooklyn Ward 7,
      Kings, District 1; and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00581_n5">14. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman wanted his brother George Washington Whitman to sell the mortgage on the
      Steers property and repay him $1,000, which would allow Jeff to invest in the
      iron furnace manufacturer. George could not sell the Steers property because he
      had already transferred the mortgage note to the mason. Louisa was probably
      frustrated that Jeff's demand for an immediate payment altered the terms that
      George had expected. Jeff initially agreed to lend George $1,000 and had agreed
      to lend an additional $3,000 in exchange for a mortgage. But Jeff had only sent
      George $2,400 toward the mortgage. Now Jeff wanted to be repaid the initial
      $1,000 immediately and ceased making monthly $200 payments on the promised
      $3,000 while $600 short of $3,000. Because Louisa was writing to Walt Whitman,
      she was probably implying that George should first repay the $600 loan to Walt
      (above George "said that six hundred he should keep to pay you") because Jeff
      had not sent George the full amount to which he had agreed and told George not
      to sell the house: Jeff, Louisa implies, could wait until George sold another
      house to be repaid the initial $1,000 in full. Louisa like George wanted the
      $1,000 to remain outstanding. By recasting George's loan of $50 to Mattie at
      Christmas as a servicing payment for Jeff's initial $1,000 loan, George could be
      considered to have paid interest due on the loan.<a href="#r14">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n13">15. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r15">[back]
