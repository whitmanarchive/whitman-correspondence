      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I got your pleasant letter, and thank you for the attention you paid my note through
      Mr. Cummins I feared our aggressiveness (perhaps my mulishness) on
      the 20 percent and other mooted questions had obliterated on your side, our
      friendship. I am happy in begging your pardon. &amp; I have not seen Townsend since his return over the water, but I had a talk with his
      beautiful and intelligent wife in 
      Phila
      
       &amp; she said that not only did Townsend admire you and yours but that he
      had also weaned  her
      from a prejudice. I do not believe that man exists whom Townsend is more anxious to
      know intimately than lusty Walt Whitman. You will both be gratified one of these
      days, for it is your and his Destiny. I wonder if I will lose two "bully" friends,
      when you two come together?
   </p>
   
   <p>Cummins is a whole [
      <span class="unclear">sound?</span>]
      , but erratic, fellow, and a good companion. He regards his
      friendships warmly. I'm glad you met him.
   </p>
   
   <p>I should like to see Burrough's&gt; book on
      you, &amp; will pay the price &amp; postage if he will
      send it to me. However I expect to be in Washington in a couple of weeks &amp; I can
      secure the  essay then.
      The health of self &amp; family is better than for sometime past—thanks to the
      pure air of the mountains. I think I never appreciated the country before—its
      flowers, its trees its rocks &amp; its brooks, to say nothing of the greenness of
      the grass or the perfumed air. I have looked for the name in the corner of the
      Lord's pockethandkerchief many times here &amp; I dare not say I have not found
      it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Write me again before I see you.</p>
   
   <p>The Ramsdell family here 
      send
      
       nothing short of love to Walt Whitman.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Hiram J. Ramsdell (1839–1887) was a clerk in
      Washington; in a hospital notebook (Henry E. Huntington Library), Walt Whitman
      called him "chief clerk."Ramsdell was the Washington correspondent for the New
      York <em>Tribune</em> and the Cincinnati <em>Commercial</em>. On , Ramsdell
      reported the high praise that George Townsend, the journalist (1841–1914),
      accorded to Walt Whitman—"a stupendous genius," "the song of a God." On
      , he asked Walt Whitman to do
      whatever he could for Judge Milton Kelly, of Idaho, against whom charges had
      been brought by "a very bad man," Congressman Edward Dexter Holbrook
      (1836–1870), a Democrat from the Idaho Territory. Actually, on July 12,
      1867, Walt Whitman had submitted to the Attorney General a "Report on the <em>Charges</em> submitted by <em>Hon. E. D.
         Holbrook</em>, Del[egate] from Idaho Terr[itory], <em>against</em>
      <em>Hon. Milton Kelly</em>, Asso[ciate] Just[ice] Supreme Court of
      Idaho" (National Archives). To this forty-one page summary of the evidence, all
      in Walt Whitman's hand, there is appended a letter signed by attorney general
      Henry Stanbery (1803–1881) but written by Walt Whitman, dated July 20,
      1867: "The Conclusion in the preceding Report is hereby adopted by me, &amp;
      ordered to stand as the decision of this Office in the Case, so far as now
      presented." On July 22, 1867, Ramsdell apologized for his "aggressiveness."
      (Ramsdell's letters are in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.) Judge Kelly
      wrote to Walt Whitman on June(?) 21, 1867 (National Archives), and again on  (Yale). On November 15, 1875,
      Ramsdell, among others, petitioned Benjamin H. Bristow (1832–1896),
      Secretary of the Treasury, that Walt Whitman "be appointed to a position in the
      Treasury Department" (National Archives).
