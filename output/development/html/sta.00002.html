      <br></br><br></br>My dear Trowbridge,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter has reached me—my best thanks for your contribution to the wounded &amp; sick,
      &amp; shall be applied in most needy cases. You speak of seeing Dr. Russell<sup><a href="#sta.00002_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—has he not rec'd a N. Y. Times of two months since containing a sketch of my Visits
      to Hospitals<sup><a href="#sta.00002_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I thought one had been sent him. If he has not had one I should like to send one
      to him. The paragraph in the Gazette by Mr Shillaber is very kind. I do not wish you to send me any of the papers. Nothing new or special
      with me—I believe I told you I was working a few hours a day, a sufficiently remunerative
      desk in Indian office—I spend a couple of hours day or evening in the hospitals. Farewell.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Townsend Trowbridge
      was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
      Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
      Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
      Eldridge edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He again met Whitman
      in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Treasury Secretary Salmon P.
      Chase in order to gather material for his biography, <em>The Ferry
         Boy and the Financier</em> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described
      their meetings in <em>My Own Story</em>, (Boston: Houghton and
      Mifflin, 1903), 360–401, with recollections of noted persons. On December
      11, 1862, Trowbridge had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending
      Whitman; see Emerson's letter from . Though Trowbridge was not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to
      William D. O'Connor in 1867: "Every year confirms my earliest impression, that
      no book has approached the power and greatness of this book, since the Lear and
      Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A. Coleman, "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 [1951–52], 327). For
      Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.71.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> (1906–1996), 3:506. See
      also Coleman, "Trowbridge and Whitman," <em>PMLA</em>, 63 (1948),
      262–273. For several weeks in 1863, Trowbridge stayed with Whitman in
      Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William D. O'Connor.

   <p id="sta.00002_n2">2. Whitman's reference is to
      "Our Wounded and Sick Soldiers—Visits among the Hospitals," which appeared in
      the New York <em>Times</em> on December 11, 1864. The piece was
      reprinted as "Hospital Visits" in Richard Maurice Bucke, ed., <em>The Wound Dresser: A Series of Letters Written from the Hospitals in
         Washington</em> (Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Company, 1898) and Bucke, ed.,
      <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> (New York, G.
      P. Putnam's Sons, 1902), 7:101–127. On , O'Connor had informed Whitman that he had read this letter
      "with a swelling heart and wet eyes. It was very great and touching to me. I
      think I could mount the tribune for you on that and speak [a] speech which jets
      fire and drops tears. Only it filled me with infinite regrets that there is not
      a book from you, embodying these rich and sad experiences. It would be sure of
      immortality. No history of our times would ever be written without it."<a href="#r2">[back]
