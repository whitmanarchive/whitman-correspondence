      <br></br><br></br>Dear John,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have 
      look'd
      
       over the Emerson notes<sup><a href="#uva.00369_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—read them all over
      once—am precluded from any thing more or giving any very deep or elaborate analysis
      of
      them, in connection with the Emerson question, (as my brain is in a state not allowing
      thought, argument or study)—but still I will give you my first impressions of your
      pages: 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In their totality, they produce a not agreeable notion of being written by one who
      has been
      largely grown &amp; ripened &amp; gristled by Emerson, but has at last become dissatisfied
      &amp; finnicky about him, &amp; would pitch into him, but cannot—perhaps dare
      not—and so keeps running around in a sort of circle of praises &amp; half praises,
      like a horse tied by a tether. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your Notes also seem to me (to be plain) a good deal too diffuse, &amp; too Emersony in
      themselves—I should select <em>about one third of the 
         MS.
         
          as first rate</em>, (including the opening part)—My opinion is that you
      had perhaps better work it all over, &amp; leave out at least half—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>About the allusions to me, my off–hand thought is that my name might be brought in,
      in one or two places, as foil or suggestive comparison—<em>but my name
         only</em>, without any praises or comments, (only the silently inferred ones)—to my
      friends, &amp; circle, who know the relations &amp; history between me &amp; Emerson, the
      mere mention of the name itself, in that way, will be significant—(&amp; it might give
      pungency to the sentence)<sup><a href="#uva.00369_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have had a bad time the last two weeks—head &amp; belly—&amp; I almost wonder
      I stand it so well—for I <em>do</em> stand it—I go out most every
      day, a little—John Swinton<sup><a href="#n0611" id="r3">3</a></sup>, from N. Y. has been to see
      me—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00369_n1">1. Burroughs published "A Word or Two on
      Emerson" and "A Final Word on Emerson" in the <em>Galaxy</em> in
      February and April, 1876; the essays were reprinted in <em>Birds
         and Poets</em> (1877), 185–210. For Whitman's final verdict on the
      articles, see his  letter to
      Burroughs.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00369_n2">2. Deferring to Whitman's wishes, Burroughs
      deleted a paragraph expressing "wonder" that Emerson had ever accepted Whitman.
      The passage was restored in <em>Birds and Poets</em>. See Clara
      Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston:
      Houghton Mifflin, 1931), 135–136.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0611">3. John Swinton (1829–1901), a journalist and
      friend of Karl Marx, became acquainted with Whitman during the Civil War.
      Swinton, managing editor of the <em>New York Times</em>,
      frequented Pfaff's, where he probably met Whitman. Whitman's correspondence with
      Swinton began on . Swinton's
      enthusiasm for Whitman was unbounded. On , Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly impressed with the great
      humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you. I read this afternoon in
      the book. I read its first division which I never before read. I could convey no
      idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more to me than all other books and
      poetry." On , Swinton wrote what
      the poet termed "almost like a love letter": "It was perhaps the very day of the
      publication of the first edition of the 'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of
      it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street, Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it
      with wonder, and felt that here was something that touched on depths of my
      humanity. Since then you have grown before me, grown around me, and grown into
      me" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.13.html">Tuesday, April 10, 1888</a>). He praised Whitman in the <em>New York Herald</em> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke,
      <em>Walt Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
      36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
      for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <em>New York Sun</em>, and for the next four years edited the
      weekly labor journal, <em>John Swinton's Paper</em>. When this
      publication folded, he returned to the <em>Sun</em>. See Robert
      Waters, <em>Career and Conversations of John Swinton</em>
      (Chicago: C.H. Kerr, 1902), and Meyer Berger, <em>The History of
         The New York Times, 1851–1951</em> (New York: Simon and Schuster,
      1951), 250–251. See also Donald Yannella, "Swinton, John
      (1829–1901)," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed.
