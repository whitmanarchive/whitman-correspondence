      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mary Costelloe 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I will write you a few lines without any thing to say, but because the spirit moves
      me &amp; every thing is so beautiful &amp; peaceful in the nearly declined but
      dazzling sun—The little children are playing out on the walks, a mocking-bird
      is singing over the way, &amp; a young just-bursting magnolia blossom, (sent me an
      hour ago by the grocery woman at the corner) fills the room
      with its spicy fragrance, from its glass of water on the window-sill—I have
      been somewhat under a cloud physically the last week, but feel better to
      day—&amp; the best of it is a sort of consciousness (if it don't deceive me)
      of being better for good—at any rate for the time, wh. is as much as could be
      asked for—
   </p>
   		
   <p>I have written &amp; sent a poem to <u>Lippincotts</u>—wh. has been accepted, &amp; I have got the money for it, 
      		(&amp; great good it does me, coming now)—Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> is here—he is drawing &amp; painting my portrait to-day—Sidney Morse<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r3">3</a></sup> has modelled a 
      large (colossal I suppose) head of me—I think perhaps the best thing yet—Love to your
      father, yourself &amp; Alys,<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> the baby dear, &amp; all—as I end, after my supper, 
      (mostly strawberries) I see glimpses of a fine sunset in the west &amp; the boys out in
      Mickle Street are playing base ball—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
