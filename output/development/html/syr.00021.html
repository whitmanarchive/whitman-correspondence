      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>After I telegraphed you today, I got the proofs, mailed from Washington, and immediately
      sat down
      and have spent most of the day proof reading. I return the sheets with this
      evening's mail, and as I shall not probably see another proof, I hope you will see
      that  the
      corrections are carefully made, since I loathe typographical errors.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish you would see that the printer puts all names of books into <u>italics</u>, as my copy indicated. I don't like to see a page
      so dotted with guillemets or quotation marks. Besides, this was the plan followed
      in
      the pamphletâ€”"The Good Gray Poet."
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>One thing I must beg, that you will restore to its place in the text so much of
      Emerson's letter as my <u>MS</u> gave. I had a tussle with Dr. Bucke about this, and he gave in,
      and allowed that there was no reason why the letter should not appear twice, or even
      three times in different parts of the book, for different reasons. It is absolutely
      necessary to my point on Cook that the letter should  stand right up there and face him
      in the context, and I beg you to have this done.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Be sure and let me have (sent here, until further notice) the proofs of the <u>Good Gray Poet</u>. There is a bit of it appended to these slips,
      and I notice that my first footnote has been changed, not entirely to my taste. What
      I wrote explained the 
      somewhat too enigmatic "sad pleasure" of the text, and the
      revised version ignores the point. I thought what I wrote perfectly deserved,
      besides, for Lowell
      is a perfect cad, and deserves the kick I gave him in my footnote. His interference
      with that letter was an extraordinary piece of  meanness and impudence, for which
      he deserved a sharper thrust than I gave him.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am not sure, thinking it over, but that I may, when I see the proofs, take out three
      or four lines on the last page of the <u>
         G.G.P</u>.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I write in a hurry, so as to catch  the mail, and not
      disappoint you. Jeannie is very ill, confined to her bed, perhaps never to be
      well again. I don't know, the prospect is distracting and gloomy.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been quite ill ever since I came here, and have read these proofs in a state
      of feebleness and confusion. It is  probable that my state is reaction
      from the severe work of the winter at Washington.
   </p>

   </p>
   
   
   <p>P.S. If I <u>can</u> see a revise, I should like it.
