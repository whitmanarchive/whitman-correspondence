   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00121_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Thos: J Whitman | 2437 2d Carondelet Av: | St. Louis Missouri. It is postmarked:
      Camden, N.J. | June | 8 PM | 87.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00121_n2">2. <em>Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</em> paid Walt Whitman $50 for his poem
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00138.html">November Boughs</a>" and published the cluster in November 1887.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00121_n3">3. Boston friends were
      raising money to buy a summer cottage they hoped would improve Whitman's failing
      health. Whitman eventually used the money to build his extravagant mausoleum in
      Harleigh Cemetery—to the shock and dismay of those who had worked hardest
      to solicit money.<a href="#r3">[back]
