      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend Walter
      
   </p>
   
   <p>it is with the greatest of pleasure that I sit down to write to you in answer to the
      letter you sent me as it is some time since I heard from you, I am happy to inform
      you we are all well at present and sincerely hope this will find you the same  young
      Walt Whitman is well and hearty out of doors almost all day long rideing down Hill
      with his little sled he will be 7 years old if he lives till spring  he is much pleased
      with the Card you sent him he chose the dark one it is a good one your boy is smart
      to learn he has never been to school as the school is about 2 miles off but he can
      read right smart.
   </p>
   
   <p>my Father &amp; Mother are smart considering their age they are still keeping House.
      George has been out here since last May he is stout he has done considerable work
      for me and we have had some nice rides going to the Political meetings last fall and
      we have elected our Man and I hope and pray he will with Gods help settle this trouble
      before long<sup><a href="#nyp.00175_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>.
   </p>
   
   <p>Walter I am sorry to inform you that I never got the paper you sent me and I think
      you better come out here yourself and give us the particulars yourself we would be
      very happy to see you, we all send our best respects to you and all your friends.
   </p>
   
   <p>you will see my pen and ink are both poor and myself a poor writer—so I will close
      by wishing you a happy New Year from your true friend

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Herman Storms, a driver,
      visited Whitman with other drivers in 1876. Whitman lists Storms's address as
      "Pascock p.o. Bergen co. N.J." in his notebook (Edward F. Grier, ed., <em>Notes and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–84], 2:481).

   <p id="nyp.00175_n2">1. Storms's relation to George
      is unclear; they were probably brothers. George Storms was a New York driver,
      father of Walt Whitman Storms, with whom Whitman corresponded in the 1870s. (See
      Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:363, 364, 371, 372; 3:431,
