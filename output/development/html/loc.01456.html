      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was glad to see again once more a scrawl from you, even in a paper. I felt also
      glad to see there is someone else more gifted 
      then
      
       me trying to honour you and make your <u>Work</u>
      
      know
      
       in our Old land. I noted the French Review—
      fein
      
       would I have read it, but alas I can only read my own tongue. I <u>often</u> and <u>often</u>—wish one
      could conjure up some spirit to give one the meaning of much I see in other tongues,
      but alas though I <u>often</u>
      <u>call</u>
      [
      <span class="unclear">no?</span>]
       spirit
      alas—comes to aid me at my call. Well to [
      <span class="unclear">cause?</span>]
       I got your
      Essay on Burns reprinted here in two local papers. I enclose one rejoinder from a
      [
      <span class="unclear">canny?</span>]
       Scot, a
      decent soul, a man that came here a Journeyman and now is the working Manager of 500
      men. he is also a [
      <span class="unclear">
         Ryhmer
         
         ?</span>]
       one little Sketch of his I enclose you. you will see he is
      of a narrow school of thought, wants <u>width</u>, <u>he has</u> got a <u>good</u>
      <u>heart</u>
      <u>though</u></p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>I must confess I felt 
      disapointed
      
       somewhat in the Burns. I fear you are not well up in Burns' Life. he was
      to all intents and purposes a Nature akin to yours. true not so wide, not so
      democratic, still a democrat. he lost [
      <span class="unclear">promotion?</span>]
       through his sympathy with the French Revolution
      1793—he sent some guns to them which were stopped. that speaks for the man's
      sympathy with the <u>cause</u> of man. Carlyle's Essay on him and
      his Poems is by far the justest I have read with 
      Lockheart
      
      's Life of him. feeling how much there's of real Kinship between your two
      natures I felt sorry to find you had not fully grasped the hand of my Hero of
      Scotland in 1793. <u>A man's a man for ah that."</u> what a
      cheering voice that is to any soul that is able to read it. then again his idea that
      even "auld Nick" might be saved if he only would take a thought and mend "as the
      widest sketch of true charity I find in any—Poetry. I find his poetry comes
      home to the heart of all human Kind. I find in my travels and talks with men, many
      of [
      <span class="unclear">their poor?</span>]
       hard
      toiling souls to whom his Poems are the very gospel of consolation and hope.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>I hope you will look it up again for us if possible. He will repay some thought I
      think I only wish I had you here beside me, then we could talk it over together so
      nicely. the stray notices I could place into your hands would enable you to see the
      full <u>man</u>. I feel glad you have done what you have, but
      yearn for <u>more</u>. give us Essays on Emerson &amp; Tennyson.
      I often try to make out for myself what you really think of these two men. you are
      so dear to me, I often wish I was by your side. I feel there is so much I sympathize
      and love in Literature,—that we could chat over, and I think 
      where
      
       it so, how many nice Essays would be done that would rejoice the hearts of
      brothers in the same grand school of human sympathy. the great hearts of our Time
      are beginning to wake up—we are beginning to shake 
      of
      
       the bondage cast over us by the Jewish Race through their Books and the
      priesthood that has arisen from them.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I learn with sorrow and deep regret, your Poems are still a venture of your own. are
      your pupils too poor? What are we think you? if our prophet starve? excuse me being
      
      to
      
       bold. The great heart of America surely cannot [
      <span class="unclear">long?</span>]
       allow this to be true? or is it the
      penalty all prophets pay for being such to a people? Well I hope <u>sunshine</u> will come, and that soon. If I can in any way be
      helpful let me know. I can at least try. we are far apart that is true. yet even
      here something I might do as a manifestation of my love and fellowship. I enclose
      some cuttings that have been saved for your reading. with a kind of loving care I
      have gathered them. I would have sent them by news post, only I was afraid they
      would get lost, so thought this way was the best. I write you these few lines,
      simply as a quick reply to your scrawl, not by any means all I hoped to write you.
      If [
      <span class="unclear">silent?</span>]
       never once
      think you are forgotten even by one of the Old land.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Dixon (1831–1880), a corkcutter of
      Sunderland, England, was one of Walt Whitman's early English admirers. In 1856
      he had bought copies of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> from a book
      peddler; one of these copies was later sent by William B. Scott to William
      Michael Rossetti. Dixon vigorously supported cultural projects and represented
      the ideal laborer of John Ruskin, who printed many of his own letters to the
      corkcutter in <em>Time and Tide</em> (1867). See <em>Autobiographical Notes of the Life of William Bell Scott</em>, ed. W. Minto
      (1892), II, 32–33, 267–269; Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt
         Whitman in England</em> (1934), 15–17; <em>The Works of
         John Ruskin</em>, ed. E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn (1905), XVII,
