      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Friend—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am greatly obliged for your Book and have been exceedingly interested<sup><a href="#n1017" id="r1">1</a></sup>—also I 
      rec'd
      
       the Paper—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The hospitals during the War, were in my mind and heart so much I could but feel the
      distress of the homesickness of the poor fellows—when the news came
      to me, that my Boy was wounded, I said "Oh tell me that he is dead. I can stand that—for it would be my own
      suffering, but I cant endure to think of Percy as
      wounded in the Hospital and homesick—it was at night the news came to us
      that he was wounded, perhaps fatally and all the night I lay in such
      distress—but the next morning—when I was hurrying them off to Pontiac
      my son in law came to me (I saw that no horse was [
      <span class="unclear">hot?</span>]
       out of the Stable)—and
      he laid his head on my shoulder and said, "Mother you said you could bear to hear
      that Percy was dead—but not that he was wounded and living"—"Yes" I
      said, "I could"—then he said, "he is dead" and I felt a sort of
      thankfulness to know that it was my sorrow not his—
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope that you 
      recd
      
       my story of "Leaves of Grass"—I and my family had hoped to have
      seen you before this—and now—we are unexpectedly call'd away—for some weeks—&amp; we shall
      still
      hope to see you—when we can—I will let you know, for I want to welcome
      you to our home—before you leave Canada
   </p>

      With thanks I am yours truly
