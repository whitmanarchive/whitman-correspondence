      <br></br><br></br>Dear Nelly,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will write you just a line—it is still the same with me—the same strange alternations—not
      perhaps quite as well, of late, (the last ten or twelve days)—&amp; yet I dont abandon 
      my anchorage of heart &amp; hope—dont <em>feel to</em>, which is a main thing with me—I have a good deal of pain, more or less steady, in
      my left side—in addition 
      to the bad spells in the head—To-day has been pleasant, &amp; I was out hobbling around
      
      from 10 to 12—probably overdid matters—as I came back sick &amp; have been so since—(though
      not enough to prevent me from eating some nice stewed oysters in moderation 
      for my dinner, a half hour since)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So dont be needlessly apprehensive, Nelly dear—for I shall get better, &amp; we will meet yet—</p>
   
   
   <p>When you write tell me about my dear Mr &amp; Mrs. Ashton—I wrote them a line off-hand,
      
      which I suppose they rec'd. Tell me all the news—tell me about Charles Eldridge—&amp; all my other friends.
      
   </p>
