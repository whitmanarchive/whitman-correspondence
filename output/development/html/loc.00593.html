      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>You will find the article you sent will be in the Times of this morning, when it is
      published. I have crowded out a great many things to get it in, and it has taken the
      precedence of army correspondence and articles which have been waiting a month for
      insertion. It is excellent—the first part and the closing part of it especially. I
      am glad to see you are engaged in such good work at Washington. It must be even more
      refreshing than to sit by Pfaff's privy<sup><a href="#loc.00593_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> and eat sweet-breads and drink coffee, and listen to the intolerable wit of the crack-brains.
      I happened in there the other night, and the place smelt as atrociously as ever. Pfaff
      looked as of yore. I read your article in proof and hope it's all accurate enough.
      "The field large—the reapers few" is the finest paragraph. Everything in New York
      moves on pretty much as usual. It's the old town—only different.
   </p>
   
   <p>My brother William<sup><a href="#loc.00593_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> sailed for Port Royal ten days ago—to be present at the attack on Charleston—if it
      is to be attacked.<sup><a href="#loc.00593_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you know Conway of Kansas?<sup><a href="#loc.00593_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> He is a good man If you don't know him, and if he would be of any service to you
      in any way, I know he would be rejoiced to serve you, if you mentioned my name to
      him.
   </p>
   
   <p>The article has some things in that I could recognize you by, but not many. I like
      it better on that account than I should otherwise.—Hoping that Vicksburg may soon
      fall.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Swinton (1829-1901),
      managing editor of the <em>New York Times</em>, frequented Pfaff's
      beer cellar, where he probably met Whitman. On January 23, 1874 (Whitman said
      "1884"), Swinton wrote what the poet termed "almost like a love letter": "It was
      perhaps the very day of the publication of the first edition of the 'Leaves of
      Grass' that I saw a copy of it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street, Brooklyn.
      I got it, looked into it with wonder, and felt that here was something that
      touched on depths of my humanity. Since then you have grown before me, grown
      around me, and grown into me" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel,
      <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, [New York: Rowan and
      Littlefield, 1905], 1:24). He praised Whitman in the <em>New York
         Herald</em> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke, <em>Walt Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883], 36-37).
      Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party for the
      mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <em>New
         York Sun</em>, and for the next four years edited the weekly labor journal,
      <em>John Swinton's Paper</em>. When this publication folded,
      he returned to the <em>Sun</em>. See Robert Waters, <em>Career and Conversations of John Swinton</em> (Chicago, 1902),
      and Meyer Berger, <em>The History of The New York Times,
         1851-1951</em> (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1951), 250-251.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00593_n2">1. This refers to Charles
      Pfaff's beer cellar located in lower Manhattan. For discussion of Whitman's
      activity there, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/walt_whitman/bohemian.html">The Bohemian Years</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00593_n3">2. John Swinton's brother
      William Swinton (1833–1892) was war correspondent of the <em>New York Times</em>. His hostility to Union generals and his unscrupulous
      tactics led to his suspension as a reporter on July 1, 1864. Whitman did not
      have a high opinion of William's journalism; see his letter from . He was professor of English at the
      University of California from 1869 to 1874. Thereafter he compiled extremely
      successful textbooks, and established the magazine, <em>Story-Teller</em>, in 1883.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.00593_n4">3. The First Battle of
      Charleston Harbor, an advance of ironclads under Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du
      Pont, finally began on April 7, 1863.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.00593_n5">4. Martin F. Conway was the
      first U.S. Congressman, a Republican, from Kansas. He had served as a vocal
      opponent to slavery—and even spent January 1, 1863, the day the Emancipation
      Proclamation went into effect, in Massachusetts with Ralph Waldo Emerson,
      William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, and Julia Ward Howe. That same month,
      he introduced a resolution before Congress calling for recognition of the
      Confederacy, so that war with the South might be fought as a war between
      nations.<a href="#r4">[back]
