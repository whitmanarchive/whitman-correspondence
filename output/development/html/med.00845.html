   <p>Yes—the fixing up of the sheets—placing of the plates, &amp;c &amp;c—all right and the
      paper-bound specimen satisfactory—But I think you can do it <em>better</em> for
      me—<em>try</em>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I want fifty (50) copies bound in good strong paper covers—w'd it do in some
      handsome <em>marble</em> paper? W'd that be better? (I leave mainly to y'r taste &amp;
      judgment)—if you have anything better as <em>strong</em> backs (stitching &amp;c) as can
      consistently be made—uncut &amp; untrimm'd like this sample (I like this sample even as
      it is pretty well)—
   </p>
   
   <p>☞ <em>I will send you the label to put on the backs</em>—<em>I am now having them
         printed</em>—(will also have the 550 copies in handsome costlier stiff bindings
      afterwards.)

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Frederick Oldach was a German
      bookbinder whose Philadelphia firm bound Whitman's <em>Complete
         Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), a volume that included a profile photo of the
      poet on the title page. The nearly 900-page book was published in December 1888.
