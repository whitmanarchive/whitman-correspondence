   <p>I express'd the plaster head<sup><a href="#n4123" id="r1">1</a></sup> to you last evening pre-paid,
      address'd to you, care of Sylvester Baxter<sup><a href="#n6000" id="r2">2</a></sup>, Herald office, 255
      Washington st. Boston—it is in a stout rather heavy box—I myself like
      the head muchly—it is what we call the 2d head—Morse<sup><a href="#duk.00863_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> made one, the 1st, with more brooding repose &amp;
      dignity, more of the antique spirit &amp;c. wh' many like best—it <em>is</em> good, &amp; attractive but tho' I like the 1st decidedly I
      am quite clear <em>this</em> is the typical one, modern, reaching out,
      looking ahead, democratic, more touch of animation (perhaps unsettledness) &amp;c.
      &amp;c.—not intended to be polished off—left purposely a little in the
      rough—
   </p>  
   
   <p>I suppose you rec'd my cards—You and S B think over what I say ab't giving the
      head to some Boston Art Institution or (if you prefer) other depositary,
      appropriate.<em>You &amp; he have absolute power to dispose of it
         in that way</em>—It ought to be ready for you there at the Herald office,
      Friday or Saturday morning—I also sent you by mail to Belmont the Cox
      photo<sup><a href="#duk.00863_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> you requested—hope you will write me
      Tuesday (or Wednesday) ab't all, the meeting &amp;c. details<sup><a href="#duk.00863_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I am ab't as usual, health &amp;c—pretty
      dull &amp; heavy—M D Conway<sup><a href="#duk.00863_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> has been to see
      me—No word from O'C[onnor]<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r7">7</a></sup>. Morse is here. I expect to
      see Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r8">8</a></sup> soon. I get word from Dr B[ucke]<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r9">9</a></sup> often. Sunshiny out to-day—I think of going forth with
      horse &amp; rig after dinner—God bless you and wife—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4123">1. The sculptor Sidney H. Morse
      (1832–1903) made two plaster busts of Whitman. Here, Whitman is referring
      to the second bust.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6000">2. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00863_n3">3. Sidney H. Morse was a
      self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to 1872,
      editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden many
      times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier bust by
      Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan, <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art, 1850–1920</em>
      (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2006), 57–84; and
      David Reynolds, <em>Walt Whitman's America: A Cultural
         Biography</em> (New York: Vintage Books, 1996), 546–590.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00863_n4">4. George Cox proposed selling
      signed copies of his photographs of Whitman. However, when the September 1887
      issue of <em>Century</em> appeared with an advertisement, Whitman
      still had not seen proofs, much less signed the photographs. He wrote John H.
      Johnston on , "He advertises...to
      sell my photo, with autograph. The latter is forged, &amp; the former illegal
      &amp; unauthorized." The disagreement was quickly resolved, and Whitman signed
      photographs for Cox and returned them.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00863_n1">5. See the letter from Walt
      Whitman to William D. O'Connor and Richard Maurice Bucke of .<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00863_n2">6. On November 12 Walt
      Whitman had a "visit from Moncure D. Conway with a carriage, to take me over to
      R P Smith's for a few days. (I do not go)" (Whitman's Commonplace Book; Charles
      E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">7. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03310_n1">8. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">9. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r9">[back]
