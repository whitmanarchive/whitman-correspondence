      <br></br>Dear sir:—
      
   </p>  
   
   <p> </span><span class="handshift">The Constitutional Centennial Commission was organized
      for the purpose of providing for the proper celebration of the first Centennial
      anniversary of the framing and promulgation of the Constitution of the United
      States. The Commission is composed of Commissioners appointed by the Governors of
      all the States, and was formally organized at Philadelphia upon the 2nd of December,
      1886. The printed matter which I forward to you under a separate cover will
      sufficiently inform you of the character of the programme determined upon, and I can
      add that every indication of a brilliant success is now assured. 
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">In the name of the Commission I write to ask you for your kind offices in the
      composition of a patriotic poem commemorative of the triumph of popular institutions
      and a century of federal constitutional government. We are well aware that the time
      is short, and that we are placing ourselves under peculiar obligations to you, but
      we appeal with confidence to your patriotism and will highly appreciate a favorable
      reply. Should you be unable to read in person 
      
      your poem be kind enough to advise
      us so that it may be read with due order in the programme by a skillful
      elocutionist.<sup><a href="#loc.01308_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
