      <br></br><br></br>Dear madam:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>No doubt you and Frank's friends have heard the sad fact of his death in hospital
      here, through his uncle, or the lady from Baltimore, who took his things. (I have
      not seen them, only heard of them visiting Frank.) I will write you a few lines—as
      a casual friend that sat by his death-bed. Your son, Corporal Frank H. Irwin, was
      wounded near Fort Fisher, Virginia, March 25th, 1865—the wound was in the left knee,
      pretty bad. He was sent up to Washington, was receiv'd in ward C, Armory-square hospital, March 28th—the wound became worse, and on the
      4th of April the leg was amputated a little above the knee—the operation was perform'd by Dr. Bliss, one of the best surgeons in the army—he did the whole operation himself—there
      was a good deal of bad matter gather'd—the bullet was found in the knee. For a couple of weeks afterwards he was doing pretty
      well. I visited and sat by him frequently, as he was fond of having me. The last ten
      or twelve days of April I saw that his case was critical. He previously had some fever,
      with cold spells. The last week in April he was much of the time flighty—but always
      mild and gentle. He died first of May. The actual cause of death was pyaemia, (the
      absorption of the matter in the system instead of its discharge). Frank, as far as
      I saw, had everything requisite in surgical treatment, nursing, &amp;c. He had watches
      much of the time. He was so good and well-behaved and affectionate I myself liked
      him very much. I was in the habit of coming in afternoons and sitting by him, and
      soothing him, and he liked to have me—liked to put his arm out and lay his hand on
      my knee—would keep it so a long while. Toward the last he was more restless and flighty
      at night—often fancied himself with his regiment—by his talk sometimes seem'd as if his feelings were hurt by being blamed by his officers for something he was
      entirely innocent of—said, "I never in my life was thought capable of such a thing,
      and never was." At other times he would fancy himself talking as it seem'd to children or such like, his relatives I suppose, and giving them good advice; would
      talk to them a long while. All the time he was out of his head not one single bad
      word or idea escaped him. It was remark'd that many a man's conversation in his senses was not half as good as Frank's delirium.
      He seem'd quite willing to die—he had become very weak and had suffer'd a good deal, and was perfectly resign'd, poor boy. I do not know his past life, but I feel as if it must have been good.
      At any rate what I saw of him here, under the most trying circumstances, with a painful
      wound, and among strangers, I can say that he behaved so brave, so composed, and so
      sweet and affectionate, it could not be surpass'd. And now like many other noble and good men, after serving his country as a soldier,
      he has yielded up his young life at the very outset in her service. Such things are
      gloomy—yet there is a text, "God doeth all things well"—the meaning of which, after
      due time, appears to the soul.
   </p> 
   
   <p>I thought perhaps a few words, though from a stranger, about your son, from one who
      was with him at the last, might be worth while—for I loved the young man, though I
      but saw him immediately to lose him. I am merely a friend visiting the hospitals occasionally
      to cheer the wounded and sick.
