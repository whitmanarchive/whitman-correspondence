      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your kind letter of Dec. 6, rec'd—&amp; much welcomed<sup><a href="#nyp.00553_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I thank you deeply &amp; Mr Lovering also<sup><a href="#nyp.00553_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—but do not consent to being an
      applicant for a pension, as spoken of—I do not deserve it—Send word to
      Mr Lovering, or show him this—I thank him deeply—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am living here in my shanty, in good spirits, but sadly disabled
      physically—(have a hard job to get from one room to the next)—Am
      occupied in getting ready the copy of a little book—my last—to be called
      "November Boughs"—the pieces in prose and verse I have thrown out the last
      four years—
   </p>
   
   <p>Best love to you &amp; to all my Boston friends—</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00553_n1">1. Baxter had outlined the
      pension plan in his letter from , at the
      conclusion of which Whitman wrote: "Answer'd &amp; sent on at once peremptorily
      declining, &amp; forbidding the pension application W W." William Sloane Kennedy
      had mentioned the possibility of a pension to Whitman as early as : "If this humbug government were
      worth a copper spangle it wd have settled a handsome pension on you, an honorary
      life salary—as a recognition of your unparalleled services during the war.
      But it wd probably be odious to you to even have the subject whispered of?" In
      his letter Baxter also referred to a "Whitman Society" that he was forming with
      John Boyle O'Reilly, Truman Howe Bartlett, and Mrs. Charles Fairchild, and to
      his article, written with W. Q. Judge, "Poetical Occultism: Some Rough Studies
      of the Occult Leanings of the Poets," <em>The Path</em> 1
      (December 1886), 270–274, a discussion of Whitman's mysticism.<a href="#r1">[back]
