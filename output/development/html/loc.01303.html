   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard W. Colles was
      probably one of the many students of Edward Dowden who became fervid admirers of
      Whitman. For more, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_93.html">Dowden, Edward (1843–1913)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
