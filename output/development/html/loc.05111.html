      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was in hopes we should have seen you here before this time—our grounds are 
      beautifull
      
       now, the trees are just in full leaf and they have that delicate fresh
      look which is so charming—the place is full of birds singing from early
      daylight all day long. A great many of your friends here are looking out anxiously
      for you (I have told them I expected you). I hope your health is not worse—I
      must say I am more afraid of that old complaint (something like laziness) keeping
      you away from us, than I am of your bodily health. But if you are still unwell
      remember that is all the more reason you should come here. I wish you would drop me
      a postcard. I am getting anxious about you
   </p>
