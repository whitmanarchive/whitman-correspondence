   <p>You know how I left you at the station to-day. I have thought of it and cannot get
      it off my mind, so I have come up to ask your forgiveness. I know how I have served
      you on many occasions before. I know that it is my falt and not yours. Can you forgive me and take me back and love me the same I will try
      by the grace of God to do better. I cannot give you up, and it makes me feel so bad
      to think how we have spent the last day or two; and all for my temper. I will have
      to <u>controol</u> it or it will send me to the states prison or some other bad place. Cant you take me back and love me the same.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      based on Edwin Haviland Miller's introduction to volume three of <em>The Correspondence</em>, in which Miller also discusses the
      occasionally troubled relationship between Whitman and Stafford (Walt Whitman,
      <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New
      York: New York University Press, 1964], 3:1–9). The letter appears on the
