   <p>From to-day I enter upon my 64th year. The paralysis that first affected me nearly
      ten years ago, has since 
      remain'd, with varying course—seems to have settled
      quietly down, and will probably continue. I easily tire, am very clumsy, cannot walk
      far; but my spirits are first-rate. I go around in public almost every day—now
      and then take long trips, by railroad or boat, hundreds of miles—live largely
      in the open air—am sunburnt and stout, (weigh 190)—keep up my activity
      and interest in life, people, progress, and the questions of the day. About
      two-thirds of the time I am quite comfortable. What mentality I ever had remains
      entirely unaffected; though physically I am a half-paralytic; and likely to be so,
      long as I live. But the principal object of my life seems to have been
      
      accomplish'd—I have the most devoted and ardent of friends, and affectionate
      relatives—and of enemies I really make no account.<sup><a href="#med.00655_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00655_n1">1. No entry in Whitman's
      Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) provides a clue to the
      identification of this person whom Whitman called in <em>Specimen
         Days</em> "a German Friend." However, in his letter of , Whitman called the letter to
      Knortz's attention. Knortz (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the
      U. S. in 1863. He was the author of many books and articles on German-American
      affairs and was superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from
      1892 to 1905. See <em>The American-German Review</em>, 8
      (December, 1946), 27–30. Knortz's first published criticism of Whitman
      appeared in the New York <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on
      December 17, 1882. In 1883, Knortz was living in New York City. In his letters
      to Whitman that year Knortz frequently included "German renderings" of poems in
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Later he assisted Thomas W. H.
      Rolleston in <em>Grashalme</em> (Zurich, 1889), which "marks the
      real beginning of Whitman's influence" in Germany (<em>Walt
         Whitman Abroad</em>, ed. Gay Wilson Allen [Syracuse: Syracuse University
      Press, 1955], 17).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="med.00655_n2">2. Whitman could never
      resist the pose of the benign poet indifferent to his enemies. His publicity
      campaign after the banning of the Osgood edition hardly confirms the
      pose.<a href="#r2">[back]
