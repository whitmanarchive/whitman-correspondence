   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Gordon Bennett Jr.
      (1841–1918) was the editor and publisher of the <em>New York
         Herald</em>, founded by his father in 1835. Julius Chambers
      (1850–1920) was an American author, investigative journalist, and travel
      writer; after working as a reporter for the <em>New York
         Tribune</em>, he became an editor of the <em>New York
         Herald</em> and, later, managing editor of the <em>New York
         World</em>. For more on the <em>Herald</em> and the many poems
      by Whitman that were published in it, see Susan Belasco, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_titles/per.00104.html">The <em>New York Herald</em></a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03238_n2">1. This top part of the letter was written by author 
      John Habberton (1842–1921), at the time the literary critic at the <em>New York Herald</em>, and indicates that he had just
      printed the notice of Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> in his September 17 "Some New Books" column.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0301">2. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker from Long
      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his
      influence on Whitman, see David S. Reynolds, <em>Walt Whitman's
         America</em> (New York: Knopf, 1995), 37–39.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03238_n1">3. Whitman sent a copy of his
      <em>November Boughs</em> essay on Elias Hicks to the New York
      <em>Herald</em>, which printed a note on Whitman in its
      September 17, 1888, "Some New Books" column, noting the publication of <em>November Boughs</em> and quoting from the Hicks essay.<a href="#r3">[back]
