   </p>
   
   <p>I 
      rec<u>d</u>
      
       the books all right, also your letter &amp; card.<sup><a href="#loc.01154_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I am just back from Roxbury where I went a week ago to make sugar in the old
      woods of my boyhood; had a pretty good time, though too much storm. Only my brother
      is now upon  the
      old farm. I have to go back there at least twice a year to ease my pain. Oh, the
      pathos of the old place where my youth was passed, where father &amp; mother lived
      &amp; died, &amp; where my heart has always been! 
   </p> 
   
   <p> I have been pretty well since I saw you, except that I have been off my sleep a good
      deal. Just now I am having a streak of sleeplessness. I do not quite know what to
      make of it. To-day is  my birth-day, too, I am 49 today. I hope spring finds you
      better. I lately heard from you through J. W. Alexander, the artist. I think he will
      make a good picture of you.<sup><a href="#pru.00001_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> He is a fine fellow. I am
      glad to hear of the projected new book.<sup><a href="#loc.01154_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I hope it is to be a reality. The title is
      good. My book "Signs &amp; Seasons" will be out this month. I do not think much of
      it,—the poorest of my books, I think. No news with me. I hope to see you in  May, as I go to
      Kentucky. I hope you will not try to face the summer again in Camden. It is very
      imprudent. A bright afternoon here, with remains of last nights snow still
      lingering.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Vols. of your Emerson so long detained" to Burroughs on .<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="pru.00001_n1">2. For three days beginning
      on Monday, February 22, Whitman sat for a portrait by Alexander. On April 17,
      1891, Alexander informed Whitman that one of the poet's admirers had purchased
      and presented the painting to the Metropolitan Museum of Art: "I am delighted to
      have been the means of giving to future generations a portrait of you that is
      certainly one of my best works" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). Burroughs, however, termed the portrait "a Bostonese
      Whitman—an emasculated Whitman—failing to show his power and
      ruggedness" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
      261). Whitman himself was not impressed (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, 9 vols. [1906–1996], 1:132, 284).<a href="#r2">[back]
