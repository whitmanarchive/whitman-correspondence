      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I received the other day from a "Breckinridge Democrat," now converted, the inclosed
      sum of twenty dollars, after he had read your letter.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have not lately made any requests of my friends for more thinking you perhaps were
      well supplied for the present. I shall be happy to hear from you again, &amp; I think
      I can find more friends hereafter if you should need them.
   </p>
   
   <p>I send this by a check &amp; I presume they will cash it for you at Willards<sup><a href="#tex.00134_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> where they know me.
      
   </p>

      Very truly yours,
      <br></br>L. B. Russell.
