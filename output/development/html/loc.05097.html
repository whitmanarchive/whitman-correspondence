   Yours

    this morning.
   
   <p>I write in haste<sup><a href="#n1027" id="r1">1</a></sup> to say that
      Lee has suddenly left Dresden, having received an
      unexpected appointment in England. So if your letter did not catch him before he
      left (last Tuesday) it is probably on its way back to you, as I hear he did not
      leave any address here. If you put it into a new envelope and address
   </p>
   
   J. F. Lee
   <br>care of Anthony Traill, F.T.C.D.
   <br>Trinity College
   <br>Dublin
   
   
   <p>it will reach him. Or I could send it on as soon as I know his address, which must
      be
      shortly. He did not know where he would be for a couple of weeks, &amp; meant
      letters to be kept here at the place he was staying at, until he wrote for them, but
      they mistook, and tell me they had them sent back to the senders. I have nothing
      more to tell you about  the translation, except that I am working away at it, find it
      difficult but not invincible. I have not the pen of a ready writer, and it will
      probably be a good time before the work can appear. But when it does I think it will
      satisfy you—At any rate you may rely upon it th[at] it shall be no emasculated
      version which I shall present to the German world.—I go on the principle of
      rigid literality, to the utmost extent reconcilable with making any representative
      sense. I think I can publish some bits of it now and then in a German weekly
      newspaper, the 'Gegenwart,' which has opened its columns to me before,<sup><a href="#loc.05097_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; so gradually prepare the German mind for the shock
      it is going to have!
   </p>
   
   <p>Lee's translation will probably be <u>postponed</u>, owing to the
      change in his plans. But I think he will carry it through. He is mediating going in
      for a Professorship  of Slav languages in Dublin, (after a time) and thinks the translation would help
      him towards that end, as no doubt it would.
   </p>
   
   <p>I got your card about the <u>Encheiridion</u> and the newspaper
      you kindly sent. There are always being reports in English papers about your coming
      to England soon. Is there any fact in them at all? I hope your new 
      edn
      
       is doing well.<sup><a href="#loc.05097_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I have just despatched a copy
      to a friend who is schoolmastering at the Cape.<sup><a href="#loc.05097_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I feel greatly the confidence you put in me about this translation. Nothing shall
      be
      spared to bring it through well.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1027">1. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.05097_n1">2. No contributions by
      Rolleston in <em>Die Gegenwart</em> between 1875 and 1882 could be
      located. Neither are there any translations of Whitman's poems by Rolleston
      between 1882, the date of this letter, and 1889, the date of the publication of
      <em>Grashalme</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.05097_n3">4. Rolleston's son, Captain C.
      H. Rolleston, informed Horst Frenz in 1950: "I do not think there can be any
      doubt that my Father's schoolmaster friend was H. B. Cotterill, M.A., who was
      later in Germany and was the author of a version of Homer's Odyssey in English
      hexameters" (Frenz, 32).<a href="#r4">[back]
