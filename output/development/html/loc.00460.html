      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I write to say that Mattie is very sick—that although yet hopeful—I fear very much
      that in some of the paroxisms of coughing she may become so weak that she will not rally again—most of the time
      she continues cheerful and good—but at times her sufferings are too much for her to
      bear—as good as she always has been about such things
   </p>
   
   <p>Of course we will all hope and pray for the best—yet you must not be surprised to
      hear that it is all over with the dear soul at any time—I have written to Walt<sup><a href="#loc.00460_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I wish Walt would come and see her—do you not think he would<sup><a href="#loc.00460_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Love to all
   </p>

   <p id="loc.00460_n2">2. Unfortunately, Walt
      Whitman had suffered a paralytic stroke on January 23 and could not leave his
      rooms (see Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961-77], 2:196). Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman wrote two letters to Jeff about the poet's stroke but neither one
      reached its destination (Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Helen Price, February 12,
      1873 [The Pierpont Morgan Library]).<a href="#r2">[back]
