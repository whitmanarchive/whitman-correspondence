      any thing like decidedly—but will probably have some more definite feeling
      soon<sup><a href="#loc.07611_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—the cloudy &amp; rainy spell continued to-day—quite a sort o' bowel movement
      this forenoon—(took a cal[omel] powder last night &amp; some bitter water this
      morning)—rare egg, fried, Graham b'd and coffee for breakfast—am to have three or
      four rare stew'd oysters for my supper ab't 5—(I eat no dinner)—all goes sort o'
      comfortable—gloomy &amp; rainy enough out tho'—mild rather—

   <p>Well it just looks out like clearing &amp; sunshine—so mote it be—Nothing very
      different with me—my head &amp;c: the "cold" &amp; stuffy (is it catarrh?) heavy, deaf,
      half-ache feeling—have been trying to interest myself in the <em>Press</em> and the <em>Tribune</em>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Dr R M Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden,

   <p id="loc.07611_n2">2. On  Bucke wrote of "the John Hopkins Hospital.
      Walt, if I were in your fix I would think seriously of going there for the next
      six months or a year . . . as a private patient. . . . I do not suppose the
      expence would be much more than the present subsidy but if it is we can easily
      get more money." See Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> (Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 1964), 5:
      84. Bucke wrote about the subject to Traubel the same date (V: 84).<a href="#r2">[back]
