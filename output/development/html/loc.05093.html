   <p>Although I suppose you hear from Harry I will send you this letter rec'd by me last evn'g as it may interest you—I am about as usual. Susan I rec'd your letter &amp; was glad to get it. I am writing a little. The wintry weather &amp; bad
      traveling keep me in more than I like—

      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Old Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your postals came "OK" and found me pretty well. Was glad to hear from you, even though
      it was through a postal: as you know, I am down on that kind of business and never
      pay any attention to them only from you, but it pleases me now to even get that much
      from an old friend. As I have told you the position I now have is not a desirable
      one but better than nothing. Have only saw Dr. Bucke once since he came home, that
      is privately, and that was the day after he arrived. He then said he would by and
      get something better for me. Will remain  
      
        
      here until we find the prospects and if nothing better promises will go to Detroit
      and from there to Chicago. I am <u>determined</u> to make a hit somewhere and dont forget it. I havent had a blue spell yet and think I can get along without any. By
      the time I receive this months pay I will be in <u>easy circum</u>, financially and will decide on a turn and let you know. I think I can manage to
      get pretty well over the N.Y. and Canada by working here and there. I love to travel and see. We have a deep snow
      here, fell a week ago. Haven't heard from home directly but once since my arrival.
      With lots of love and a good old time kiss I am ever your boy
   </p>
