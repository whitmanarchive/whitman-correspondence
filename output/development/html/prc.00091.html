   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00091_n2">1. Alden wrote Whitman on
      , to inform him that "Citizen
      Rosetti's article" would appear in the <em>Citizen</em> the
      following day (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], 9 vols., 3:259). No copies of the <em>Citizen</em> prior to 1869 have survived, but Whitman appears
      to have read and enjoyed the article.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="prc.00091_n3">2. Charles G. Halpine
      (1829–1868) was a journalist, soldier, and politician. He joined the 69th
      New York Regiment at the outbreak of the war and was brevetted brigadier general
      for gallantry. Known as a humorist and author, under the pseudonym Pvt. Miles
      O'Reilley, Halpine was also a well-known journalist who wrote for the New York
      <em>Herald</em>, and later became editor of <em>The Leader</em>. It would appear that, in 1867, Halpine was writing for the
      <em>Citizen</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
