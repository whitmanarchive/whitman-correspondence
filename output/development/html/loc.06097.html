   <p> Just a line any how, dear Mary, to follow up the good wishes &amp; invocations of my
      last, &amp; to try the new address upon an envelope—As I write I am sitting
      here by the open window in the little room down stairs—a fine bright cool
      noon—have 
      rec'd
      
       quite a mail this forenoon—in it your good letter of Aug.
      28—(yesterday Alys's circular arrived to me, at last)— 
   </p>
   
   <p> I do not go out much—the effect of the sunstroke shocks still lingering upon
      me, &amp; probably will continue ("the ground already too well prepared," the doctor
      says)—have not written any for two months or over—But I am afraid I am falling into
      an unnecessarily sombre vein—which I ought not to, for I
      don't feel it, &amp; there is nothing to warrant it— 
   </p>
   
   <p> I shall be looking for Alys now before long—&amp; you, dear friend, must make
      it up in frequent letters—

   <p> I have sent the pictures for Toynbee Hall to Rev. Mr Barnett—Mrs.
      Gilchrist's address is 12 Well Road, Hampstead—You might take this letter,
      &amp; read her as the latest—As I finish, Mrs. D[avis] brings in (presents from
      friends) a dish of grapes, &amp; a great bunch of radiant yellow flowers mingled
      with "snow on the mountain"—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
