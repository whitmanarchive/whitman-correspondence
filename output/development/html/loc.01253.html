   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1515">1. In May 1876, Whitman met Edward
      Cattell, a young farm hand and a friend of the Staffords. The poet took an
      interest in the Cattell family: "about 25 or 6—folks mother, father
      &amp;c. live at Gloucester—his grand, or great grandfather, Jonas Cattell,
      a great runner, &amp; Revolutionary soldier, spy." Whitman referred to Jonas in
      the <em>Philadelphia Times</em> on January 26, 1879. Whitman took
      special interest, however, in Edward, as charged entries from one of his diaries
      make clear: "the hour (night, June 19, '76, Ed &amp; I.) at the front gate by
      the road." Two days later he noted "the swim of the boys, Ed. [Stafford?], Ed.
      C. &amp; Harry" (<em>Diary Notes</em> in Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection). In 1877 Whitman cited "Sept meetings Ed C by the pond at Kirkwood
      moonlight nights" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.), and in <em>Diary Notes</em> on October 29, "Ed. Cattell
      with me."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0852">2. George Stafford was the father of
      Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's
      parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near
      Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. For more
      on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>" <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, eds., (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 685.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">3. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
