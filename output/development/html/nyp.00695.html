         fail</em>—Have you rec'd the "Liberty" Boston, dated Sept. 7?—I
      requested one sent you at North Perry a week ago—If not reach'd you get one in
      Boston—there is a good <em>memoriam</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00697_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> of dear W<sup><a href="#nyp.00695_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> (by Horace

      storm—Sir Edwin Arnold,<sup><a href="#loc.07701_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> the English poet, was here to see
      me, very cheery &amp; eulogistic—aged ab't 40, quite a traveler, now bound
      (soon) to the Pacific &amp; round the world—I enclose you a picture or two
      besides—the one in the hat I call "the laughing philosopher"<sup><a href="#nyp.00583_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup>—I am

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n2002">1. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="nyp.00695_n1">2. Ellen O'Connor on  asked Whitman's advice as to which
      picture of her husband she should submit to <em>Appleton's
         Encyclopedia</em>. She also described her anxiety: "I <u>dread</u>, dear Walt, I can't tell any one how much I dread the going back
      home. I say <u>home</u>, but the sense of loneliness that
      overtakes me when I think of going is heart-sickening. And the uncertainty of
      all adds to it" (Feinberg).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00697_n2">3. Horace L. Traubel's article,
      "W.D. O'Connor of Massachusetts," was published in <em>Liberty</em> 6 (September 7, 1889), 5. Whitman praises the article in
      conversation with Traubel. See Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitman-dev.unl.edu/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.152.html">Saturday, September 7, 1889</a>.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n4267">5. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="loc.07701_n2">6. On , Sir Edwin Arnold
      (1832–1904) wrote from Washington, D. C. requesting permission to visit
      Whitman. (The Boston <em>Traveller</em> on October 5, 1889,
      however reprinted a purported letter from Arnold to Whitman dated September 12,
      written from New York, in a flamboyant style not found in the actual letter.)
      For an account of Arnold's visit, see Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.157.html">Thursday, September 12, 1889 </a>and <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.157.html">Saturday, September 14, 1889</a>: "My main objection to him, if objection
      at all, would be, that he is too eulogistic—too flattering." Arnold
      published his own version of the interview in <em>Seas and
         Lands</em> (1891), in which he averred that the two read from <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, surrounded by Mrs. Davis, knitting, a
      handsome young man (Wilkins), and "a big setter." There are at least two
      additional accounts of Arnold's visit with Whitman; "Arnold and Whitman" was
      published anonymously in <em>The Times</em> (Philadelphia, PA) on
      <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00519.html">September 15, 1889</a> and a different article, also titled "Arnold and
      Whitman" was published anonymously in <em>The Daily Picayune</em>
      (New Orleans, LA) on <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00637.html">September 26, 1889</a>. Arnold was best known for his long narrative poem, 
      <em>The Light of Asia</em> (1879), which tells the life story and philosophy of Gautama Buddha and was largely
      
      responsible for introducing Buddhism to Western audiences.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00583_n3">7. "The Laughing
      Philosopher," one of the most famous photographs of Walt Whitman, was taken by
      G.C. Cox in 1887. It is reproduced in <em>Specimen Days</em>
      (1971), plate 174.<a href="#r7">[back]
