      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of 27 January,<sup><a href="#syr.00034_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> and Leaves of Grass, received.
      Please accept my sincere thanks for your kindness in sending me the book and for the
      gratification you have given me by writing in it as I requested. I beg to enclose
      P.O. order in your favor for One Pound—No. 2044.
   </p> 
   
   <p>I hope that you did not consider my request for your photograph impertinent. My only
      intimation that you had had one recently taken was the published letter to you from
      Tennyson<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r2">2</a></sup> and therefore my allusion to it. It was a very
      deep disappointment to me that I failed so signally in my endeavor to prove to you
      how many in Ireland would gladly avail themselves of an opportunity to show their
      gratitude for such a gift as Leaves of Grass. But the reason is readily given. The
      chief men in connection with the University had contributed through Mr. H.H.
      Gilchrist,<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r3">3</a></sup> and such men as the Lord Chancellor<sup><a href="#syr.00034_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> and Sir E.C. Guinness<sup><a href="#syr.00034_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> resemble 
      Gallio<sup><a href="#syr.00034_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> 
      in that they care for none of these things. Professor Edward
      Dowden<sup><a href="#n0199" id="r7">7</a></sup> I have the honor of knowing for the past eighteen
      months—indeed, it is to my love of Leaves of Grass that I am indebted for my
      acquaintance with so lovable a man—and he is aware that I did my
      best—however—perhaps I soared too high—in addressing Barbarians. I
      had told Dowden of my not having received any reply to my cards or letters and my
      apprehension that you might be ill, and I have therefore all the greater pleasure
      in
      conveying (to him at least) your "best regards."
   </p>
   
   <p>The two volumes I mentioned as having been sold by me were purchased by the National
      Library for one pound.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard W. Colles was
      probably one of the many students of Edward Dowden who became fervid admirers of
      Whitman. For more, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_93.html">Dowden, Edward (1843–1913)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n0625">2. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">3. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

         </a></p>
   <p id="syr.00034_n3">4. At the time of Colles'
      letter, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland was highest judicial official, and Edward
      Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne (1837–1913) held the position from
      1886–1892.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="syr.00034_n2">5. Edward Cecil Guinness, 1st
      Earl of Iveagh (1847–1927) was an Irish businessman, serving as the
      chairman of the Guinness Company and running the Dublin brewery for more than
      twenty years. He was also well-known as a philanthropist and had a lifelong
      interest in collecting fine art.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="syr.00034_n4">6. Colles is referring to the
      Roman senator Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus, mentioned in the Book of Acts as
      being indifferent to charges that Jews brought against the Apostle Paul: "Gallio
      cared for none of these things."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0199">7. Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>).
