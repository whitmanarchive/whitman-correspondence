   <p>I am still anchored here—sit up some, but only for a short spell at a time—am
      feeble, and have distress in the head—these are the worst features—but am
      gradually regaining the use of my left limbs—very, very slowly, but <em>certainly gaining</em>—Doctor only comes now every other day—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I write Mrs. O'Connor<sup><a href="#n0450" id="r2">2</a></sup> is sitting here in the room, mending some stockings &amp;c for
      me—she has brought me some nice roast apple in a tumbler—It is a dark wet day
      to-day—not very favorable—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother dear, I rec'd your letter, acknowledging the money—I have written a short
      letter to Hannah<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r3">3</a></sup>, &amp; also one to Jeff<sup><a href="#n0710" id="r4">4</a></sup>—which they must have
      rec'd by this time—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I keep up my spirits very well—do not need for any thing—Love to you, &amp;
      all, dearest mother,

   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I have tacked your picture up on the wall at the foot of the bed—the one I
      like—it looks as natural as can be—&amp; is quite company for me—as I am
      alone a good deal, (&amp; prefer to be)—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0450">2. For a time Walt Whitman lived with William D. and
      Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to
      be his close associates during the early Washington years. William Douglas
      O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good
      Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In 1872 Whitman
      and William strongly disagreed on the Fifteenth Amendment, which Whitman opposed
      and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended Whitman's opinion, and in response
      William moved out. The correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost
      as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0285">3. Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908),
      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0710">4. Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890), known as
      "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
      eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
      recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
      marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
      correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
      together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Matty) in 1873 and
      his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
      his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!" For
      more on Thomas Jefferson Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
