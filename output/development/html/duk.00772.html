   <p>Your "Holmes" rec'd<sup><a href="#duk.00772_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—thank you kindly—The brief glance
      over &amp; through it I have given impresses me what a <em>clean</em>
      piece of work it is—what a presentable book—Dr R M Bucke of Canada has
      just finished the printing (type-setting) of his book "Walt Whitman"—to
      be published here 
      ab't
      
       end of this month by David McKay, 23 South 9th 
      Phila.<sup><a href="#duk.00772_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—(Pub'r
      
       of my books) I will send you one soon as it is out—I am well, for
      me—have had a pretty good winter—
