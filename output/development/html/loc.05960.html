   </p>
   
   <p>Your post card of 28 April<sup><a href="#loc.05960_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> was sent down to me here<sup><a href="#loc.05960_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> yesterday. I have had O'Connor's little book<sup><a href="#loc.05960_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> and read it. Have been in England now nearly two weeks
      and am having a pleasant time seeing all my old friends &amp;c. I saw Mrs Costelloe
      a couple of times and took her last friday to the Grand Theatre, Islington, in
      London to see Shelley's Cenci acted. The play was put on the boards by the Shelley
      Society and acted "privately" not advertised, but the theatre (a very large one) was
      crowded. Vezin acted old cenci &amp; Alma Murray Beatrice and these two part were
      about the best acting I have ever seen. When I return to London (early next week I
      think) I am to stay a few days with Mrs Costelloe and shall write you again from
      there. We had a long passage (16 days) I enjoyed the sea very much &amp; was almost
      sorry to get to England, the voyage did me good too. I was over a week in London
      before I came down here and was pretty busy while there. After my visit to Mrs
      Costelloe I go to Scotland. The weather was good all across the ocean and very fine
      the week I was in London but since I have never been here it has been cloudy cold
      and wet—but it does not much matter
   </p>
   
   <p>I am enjoying myself and getting a good rest which I needed after the bustle of
      London. Goodly, remember me to Mrs Davis, I expect you will be living in great style
      when I get back you are so rich now!<sup><a href="#loc.05960_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
