   <p>Thank you for the little volumes—three copies have reached me<sup><a href="#pri.00010_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—they look very well, &amp; I am pleased with them,
      &amp; with prefatory notice—I am here, ab't the same as of late
      years—Keep up pretty good spirits &amp; buoyancy—that makes the best of
      it all—Give my respects to the Walter Scott folk—&amp; dont forget to
      write to me soon, to let me know how the Vol. goes—I much hope to reach the
      working men, &amp; guilds of the British Islands—especially the young
      fellows—&amp; trust the W. S. vol. will forward that object.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pri.00010_n1">1. <em>Leaves
         of Grass: The Poems of Walt Whitman [Selected]</em>, with an introduction by
      Rhys, was printed in 1886 in The Canterbury Poet Series, published by Walter
      Scott. Whitman noted receipt of the volumes on March 18 in his Commonplace Book
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). A presentation copy in the Feinberg
      Collection reads: "Walt Whitman with Ernest Rhys's apologies &amp; high regards.
      1st March 1886." On  Rhys informed the poet
      that about 8,000 copies of the edition were sold, and that the publisher
      expected to print a second edition. In the same letter Rhys requested permission
      to include <em>Specimen Days</em> in a prose series called The
      Camelot Classics.<a href="#r1">[back]
