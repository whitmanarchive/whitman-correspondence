      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.00778_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am going to write you to ask any friends you may be in communication with for aid
      for my soldiers. I remain here in Washington still occupied among the hospitals—I
      have now been engaged in this over seven months. As time passes on it seems as if
      sad cases of old &amp; lingering wounded accumulate, regularly recruited with new ones
      every week—I have been most of this day in Armory Square Hospital, Seventh st. I seldom
      miss a day or evening. Out of the six or seven hundred in this Hosp[ital] I try to
      give a word or a trifle to every one without exception, making regular rounds among
      them all. I give all kinds of sustenance, blackberries, peaches, lemons &amp; sugar, wines, all
      kinds of preserves, pickles, brandy, milk, shirts &amp; all articles of underclothing,
      tobacco, tea, handkerchiefs, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c. I always give paper, envelopes, stamps, &amp;c.
      I want a supply for this purpose. To many I give (when I have it) small sums of money—half
      of the soldiers in hospital have not a cent. There are many returned prisoners, sick,
      lost all—&amp; every day squads of men from [the] front, cavalry or infantry—brought in
      wounded or sick, generally without a cent of money. Then I select the most needy cases
      &amp; devote my time &amp; services much to them. I find it tells best—some are mere lads,
      17, 18, 19 or 20. Some are silent, sick, heavy hearted, (things, attentions, &amp;c. are
      very rude in the army &amp; hospitals, nothing but the mere hard routine, no time for
      tenderness or extras)—So I go round—Some of my boys die, some get well—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>O what a sweet unwonted love (those good American boys, of good stock, decent, clean,
      well raised boys, so near to me)—what an attachment grows up between us, started from
      hospital cots, where pale young faces lie &amp; wounded or sick bodies. My brave young
      American soldiers—now for so many months I have gone around among them, where they
      lie. I have long discarded all stiff conventions (they &amp; I are too near to each other,
      there is no time to lose, &amp; death &amp; anguish dissipate ceremony here between my lads
      &amp; me)—I pet them, some of them it does so much good, they are so faint &amp; lonesome—at
      parting at night sometimes I kiss them right &amp; left—The doctors tell me I supply the
      patients with a medicine which all their drugs &amp; bottles &amp; powders are helpless to
      yield.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish you would ask any body you know who is likely to contribute—It is a good holy
      cause, surely nothing nobler—I desire you if possible could raise for me, forthwith,
      for application to these wounded &amp; sick here, (they are from Massachusetts &amp; all the
      New England states, there is not a day but I am with some Yankee boys, &amp; doing some
      trifle for them)—a sum—if possible $50—if not, then less—$30—or indeed any am't—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am at present curiously almost alone here, as visitor &amp; consolator to Hospitals—the
      work of the different Reliefs &amp; Commissions is nearly all off in the field—&amp; as to
      private visitors, <em>there are few or none</em>—I wish you or some of your friends could just make a round with me, for an hour or
      so, at some of my hospitals or camps—I go among all our own dear soldiers, hospital
      camps &amp; army, our teamsters' hospitals, among sick &amp; dying, the rebels, the contrabands,
      &amp;c &amp;c. What I reach is necessarily but a drop in the bucket but it is done in good
      faith, &amp; with now some experience &amp; I  hope with good heart.<sup><a href="#loc.00778_n100" id="r2">2</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00778_n2">1. When Whitman gave this
      letter to Horace Traubel on August 12, 1888, he observed: "I don't know for sure
      who it was written to—probably one of those Boston women—the Curtis people, it
      may be" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Rowman and Littlefield, 1961], 2:127). It seems probable, however, that
      this draft letter was addressed to James Redpath, who gave the original to Dr.
      Le Baron Russell (see Whitman's letter from ), who in turn gave it to Mrs. Charles P. Curtis (see the letter
      from ). An
      envelope in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection is The letter is endorsed,
      "letter to Jas. Redpath | Aug 6th '63."James Redpath (1833–1891) was the
      author of <em>The Life of John Brown</em> (1860), a correspondent
      for the <em>New York Tribune</em> during the war, the originator
      of the "Lyceum" lectures, and editor of the <em>North American
         Review</em> in 1886. He met Whitman in Boston in 1860 (The Library of
      Congress #90), and remained an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (New York: Rowman and
      Littlefield, 1961), 3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on
      June 25, 1860: "I love you, Walt! A conquering Brigade will ere long march to
      the music of your barbaric yawp" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (New York: Rowman
      and Littlefield, 1961), 3:460). See also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath</em> (New York: Barse and Hopkins, 1926). In
      February 1863, Whitman had evidently written to Redpath for assistance with his
      work in the hospitals. Redpath reported on March 10, 1863 (Thomas Donaldson, <em>Walt Whitman the Man</em> [New York: F. P. Harper, 1896], 143)
      that he had called Whitman's appeal to the attention of Emerson, who replied on
      February 23, 1863: "I shall make some trial whether I can find any direct
      friends and abettors for him and his beneficiaries, the soldiers" (144).
      Redpath, however, noted on May 5, 1863 that "Emerson tried to have something
      done about you, but failed" (144), and explained: "There is a prejudice agst you
      here among the 'fine' ladies &amp; gentlemen of the transcendental School. It is
      believed that you are not ashamed of your reproductive organs, and, somehow, it
      wd seem to be the result of their logic—that eunuchs only are fit for nurses. If
      you are ready to qualify yourself for their sympathy &amp; support, that you may
      not unnecessarily suffer therefrom, is the sincere wish of your friend"
      (Historical Society of Pennsylvania; omitted in Donaldson's transcription of the
      letter). See also Whitman's letters to Redpath from 
       and
