   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00719_n1">1. On January 1, Whitman
      received $50 from George W. Childs, co-owner of the Philadelphia <em>Public Ledger</em> (Whitman's Commonplace Book, and see
      Whitman's letter to Childs of ).
      He had received a similar amount on January 13, 1885 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book). In "Personal Recollections of Walt Whitman," <em>Scribner's
         Magazine</em>, 65 (1919), 685, William R. Thayer, in discussing Whitman's
      slyness in money matters, stated that for the last six or eight years of the
      poet's life Childs and Horace Howard Furness subscribed "an annual sum," and
      paid a young man to act as his driver and valet.<a href="#r1">[back]
