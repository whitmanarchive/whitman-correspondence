      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:— 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>You will see by the enclosed card that I have returned to the Internal Revenue
      service. I regretted to leave Los Angeles and the practice of law, but times got
      very hard there, and although I had some important cases and good fees in prospect
      I
      was unable to realize the cash proceeds; so I applied and got my present portion—same
      that I held
      before.—I hope to resume practice in the state, some time in the future, when
      I have paid my debts and saved a little money.—I am now a citizen of
      California and hope to always remain such. I should not be contented to settle down
      in the East, again, I think.—
   </p>
   
   <p>The death of William O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r11">11</a></sup> though long anticipated, was a
      great shock when the news came—What a wealth of intellectual enthusiasm and
      power was there extinguished, if it could be so: but I don't believe he or any of
      us
      can go out like a child's carlacue in the night.<sup><a href="#loc.02028_n1" id="r12">12</a></sup> I have faith to believe that we shall all meet again on the other side of
      Jordan, &amp; if we can only have such good times as we had of yore in Washington I shall be
      content. My mother is still living in Boston at the age of 75, well and hearty.
      Thank God—I have not seen her for two years, and more.
   </p>
   
   <p>I read with much emotion in the Philadelphia &amp; Camden papers the account of your
      Seventieth Birthday dinner.<sup><a href="#loc.03027_n4" id="r13">13</a></sup> I was especially touched by John Burroughs letter.—I am indebted to you for many
      papers—Always
      glad to get them.—Address me until further notice simply Internal Revenue Agent. San
      Francisco. Cal. I hope you
      are fairly comfortable.—God bless you my old and long tried friend—"With
      fond affection and recollection.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Burroughs and Richard Maurice
      Bucke were two of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Burroughs
      (1837–1921), a naturalist, met Whitman in Washington, D.C. in 1864 and
      became one of Whitman's most frequent correspondents. He would also go on to
      write several studies of Whitman. Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian physician,
      was Whitman's first biographer, and would later become one of his medical
      advisors and literary executors. For more on Whitman's relationship with
      Burroughs, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on his
      relationship with Bucke, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice (1837–1902).</a></p>

   <p id="n0210">2. Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0830">3. Joseph B. Marvin, a friend and
      an admirer of Whitman's poetry, was from 1866 to 1867 the co-editor of the <em>Radical</em>. He was then appointed as a clerk in the Treasury
      Department in Washington, on behalf of which he took a trip to London in the
      late fall of 1875. On , Whitman
      wrote a letter to William Michael Rossetti to announce a visit from Marvin.
      Rossetti gave a dinner for Marvin, which was attended by the following "good
      Whitmanites": Anne Gilchrist; Joseph Knight, editor of the London <em>Sunday Times</em>; Justin McCarthy, a novelist and writer for
      the London <em>Daily News</em>; Edmund Gosse; and Rossetti's
      father-in-law, Ford Madox
      Brown.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4108">4. Ignatius Loyola Donnelly
      (1831–1901) was a politician and writer, well known for his notions of
      Atlantis as an antediluvian civilization and for his belief that Shakespeare's
      plays had been written by Francis Bacon, an idea he argued in his book <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in Shakespeare's
         Plays</em>, published in 1888.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07305_n3">5. In his pamphlet <em>Mr. Donnelly's Reviewers</em> (Chicago: Belford, Clarke &amp;
      Co., 1889), O'Connor attempted to defend Ignatius Donnelly's Baconian theories,
      as found in <em>The Great Crytogram</em> (1887).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07678_n2">6. On , Mrs. O'Connor informed Whitman that
      she was sending him a copy of William's "last literary work," <em>Mr. Donnelly's Reviewers</em>. On ,
      Burroughs commented: "I read Williams pamphlet on Donnellys Reviewers with
      melancholy enjoyment. It is very brilliant &amp; effective, quite equal to his
      best work I think. If he had only left out some of his mud-epithets, or if he
      had only not claimed Montaignes Essays &amp; Burtons Melancholy for Bacon! How
      such a claim as that does discredit the whole business.... Wm was fated to slop
      over in just this way, &amp; to steel his reader against him."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">7. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

   <p id="n0892">8. Ursula North Burroughs
      (1836–1917) was John Burroughs's wife. Ursula and John were married on
      September 12, 1857. The couple maintained a small farm overlooking the Hudson
      River in West Park, Ulster County. They adopted a son, Julian, at two months of
      age. It was only later revealed that John himself was the biological father of
      Julian.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01151_n1">9. Julian Burroughs
      (1878–1954), the only son of John and Ursula Burroughs, later became a
      landscape painter, writer, and photographer.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4195">10. Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), a volume Whitman often referred to
      as the "big book," was published by Philadelphia publisher David McKay in
      December 1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, he made the presswork and
      binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the book, which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more information on
      the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">11. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r11">[back]

   <p id="loc.02028_n1">12. Eldridge is echoing Whitman's line in 
      "Song of Myself"—"I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt
      stick at night."<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03027_n4">13. For Whitman's seventieth
      birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
      the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
      (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.30.html">Tuesday, May 7, 1889</a>. The day was celebrated with a testimonial
      dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
      addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
      arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks.<a href="#r13">[back]
