      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I write, enclosing money for book and postage, hoping that the 300th copy of this
      last edition of your works has not yet been sold; I am very anxious to possess a
      copy, and to read and judge you finally for myself by the work you yourself approve
      best, as hitherto some ill fortune has prevented me from getting anything like a
      comprehensive survey of your Art.—The latter word is one which may jar on your
      ear, as suggesting Art—ificiality! But you must know that I am an artist, and
      am able, out
      of my craftman's knowledge, to separate Art as craft from Art as the thing that
      binds mortals in the bonds of sympathy with Nature.—What a hard thing it is to
      put down plainly and squarely what one means! I mean that I want to get a better
      view of you as <u>Artist</u>, apart from <u>Art-craftsman</u>. I don't remember coming across any positive statement of
      your opinion on the latter, but you must be the former, however much you despise
      conventional artistic forms.—Forgive some vagueness of statement,—I am
      still a very young man.—Please send the book, if you still can spare one, to
      the address, 2. Langland Gardens. Frognal. Finchley Road. London. N. W. England
   </p>

      <br></br>Yours sincerely
      <br></br>Walter Delaplaine Scull
