   <p>As you have not found the little piece "Ethiopia Commenting" available, allow me to
      withdraw itâ€”Indeed I have already sent it to another quarter.<sup><a href="#nyp.00266_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00266_n1">1. Walt Whitman had
      submitted "Ethiopia Commenting" to the <em>Galaxy</em> on . If he sent the poem "to another
      quarter," it has not as yet been discovered. It later became "Ethiopia Saluting
      the Colors"; see Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em> 23.3 (November 1951), 337.<a href="#r1">[back]
