   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="loc.07587_n2">4. Bucke wrote candidly on
      : "We must make up our minds to
      his death or <em>worse</em>—for should he live much longer
      his life would necessarily become a burden to himself and others." He enclosed a
      letter from Dr. T. B. Hood, O'Connor's physician, written on March 19 (Horace

   <p id="med.00869_n3">5. Whitman had a limited pocket-book edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      printed in honor of his 70th birthday, on May 31, 1889, through special
      arrangement with Frederick Oldach. Only 300 copies were printed, and Whitman
      signed the title page of each one. The volume also included the annex <em>Sands at Seventy</em> and his essay <em>A
         Backward Glance O'er Traveled Roads</em>. See Whitman's , letter to Oldach. For more

   <p id="n4983">7. David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
