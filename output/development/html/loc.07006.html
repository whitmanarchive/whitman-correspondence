   <p>
      Yours of to-day rec'd—(The other also—but I thought you merely contemplated it like, &amp; no hurry)—I only
      write now in haste to say I will help
      you to any thing on the subject you desire—Will turn it over in my mind to
      write more fully Sunday, so you will get it Monday.

   <p>I have a notion that the raciest part of a fellow's life—mine at any rate—could
      be told by giving copious strings of characteristic fine <em>personal anecdotes,
         incidents—&amp;c—</em>
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>Jenny, what is it for?

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07006_n1">1. Early in December
      Jeannette L. Gilder wrote to Whitman, in his words, "that she is going to write
      my life &amp; asking for items &amp;c" (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–69],
      3:141). Although Whitman complied with her request, nothing came of the
      proposal. About the same time, in a letter to John Burroughs of , Whitman wrote: "(I
      would like best to be <em>told about</em> in strings of continuous
      anecdotes, incidents, mots, thumbnail personal sketches, characteristic &amp;
      true—)." The biographical principle enunciated here was to be followed
      scrupulously a few years letter by Richard Maurice Bucke in his biography of the
      poet.<a href="#r1">[back]
