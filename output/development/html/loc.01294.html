   <p> I have this moment clipped the enclosed paragraph about
      Garibaldi from the
      Paris correspondence of this morning's <em>
         N Y
         
          Times</em>. What a fine
      photo.h
      of a splendid man! I wonder why it made me think of <u>you</u>! It <u>did</u>, though, and so I send it to you
      with the regards of
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours truly
      <br></br>H. Clapp Jr.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>The last I have heard of GARIBALDI'S movements was that he was at the villa of
      his friend, the Marquis DE PALLAVICINI, in the neighborhood of Milan. This was
      on the 16th, the day on which it was so confidently announced by his partisans
      in Florence that he had crossed the Papal frontier. In the last number of the
      <em>Figaro</em>, I find the following "physiology" of this
      remarkable man, by M. VILLEMOT, which, though bordering on the caricature, is so
      correct in many points that I think it will interest as well as amuse your
      readers:
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"'Liberator' or 'heroical bungler' GARIBALDI is a figure. Had I any disposition
      to believe in the supernatural he would have converted me. Against all reason
      and human wisdom, and to the profound humiliation of vulgar calculations, he has
      accomplished things which are to be classed among miracles and legends. He is
      not a great captain; as a tactician he is no better than JEANNE D'ARC, but like
      her he has a familiar demon; he hears voices and takes the field. When he
      captures a throne he seats himself upon it, eats a bunch of grapes and inquires
      after his goats. He has not got a sou, and if he is a Chevalier of
      St. Maurice and Lazare, he is profoundly ignorant of the fact.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Educated people say: 'You now see that he is nothing but a rowdy; he may have a
      palace, receive diplomatic corps, and eat carp <em>a la
         chambord</em>, but he loves best to live on a crust of bread rubbed with
      garlic.' But GARIBALDI likes to be judged from the point of view of his
      temperament, and on this side of the Alps he cannot be very well understood. He
      is reproached with not dressing himself like M. ROUHER, and with wearing a
      boatman's shirt, a slouched hat and a Scotch plaid. They accuse him, moreover,
      of those turgidities of style which wound ears accustomed to the small flute of
      the Academies. They forget that he is operating in the land of TASSO and
      ARIOSTO, and if our genius induces us to the search after symplicity that of
      Italy accommodates itself to a lyricism which with us is not in fashion except
      in the minor drama.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>GARIBALDI is the expression of the land and the age that gave him birth. You
      cannot get him to attire himself; you cannot get him to express himself
      otherwise than is in 
      hts
      
       nature. In his general physiognomy there is a mixture of the prophet
      and the child. Of our civilization, of our manners, of our vices and our crosses
      he knows nothing. He marches ahead without seeing. He lives in an ideal 
      worlp
      
      , and knows no more of the men of his time than a contemporary hero of
      the <em>Illiad</em> rising from his dust.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>His innocence exceeds all belief. The following is an example of it. A few years
      ago he said to a friend, 'You are aware that I gave notes to M. ALEXANDER DUMAS
      to write my memoirs from. Would you believe that he has added to them a number
      of things of his own invention?'
   </p>
   
   
   <p>BRAVE GARIBALDI! Write not your memoirs and get no one to write them. Let the
      people whom you have 
      fantacised
      
       compose your legend, and you will take your place among the great
      Sphinxes of history."

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Henry Clapp (1814â€“1875) was a journalist,
      editor and reformer. Whitman and Clapp most likely met in Charles Pfaff's beer
      cellar, located in lower Manhattan. Clapp, who founded the literary weekly the
      <em>New-York Saturday Press</em> in 1858, was instrumental in
      promoting Whitman's poetry and celebrity; over twenty items on Whitman appeared
      in the <em>Press</em> before the periodical folded in 1860. Clapp
      told Horace Traubel, "You will have to know something about Henry Clapp if you
      want to know all about me." (For Whitman's thoughts on Clapp see <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.60.html">"Sunday, May 27, 1888"</a>.
