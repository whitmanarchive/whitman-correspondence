      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt: 
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>I posted you six copies of the last circular this afternoon; I think that John Fraser
      has printed them beautifully, and I told him so. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I have received ten shillings from one Richard Colles<sup><a href="#loc.02174_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> (A
      friend of Dowden)<sup><a href="#n0199" id="r2">2</a></sup> which I enclose herewith;— "You will kindly
      consider it annual &amp; I hope not only to increase the sum but have great
      pleasure of sending it for many years." This I quote from his letter, enclosing the
      sum. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Colles, then goes on to say  something appreciative of my dear mother's Essays; 
      wch
      
       pleased and gratified me much. 
   </p>
   
   <p>You will be pleased to hear that I have got over my worries in connection with the
      contract for my Book:<sup><a href="#loc.02178_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> Thomas Fisher Unwin signed the
      agreement last week; and he is now making arrangement with Roberts of Boston to
      Publish the Book there. Do you know anything of Roberts?<sup><a href="#loc.02174_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I am so sorry that I have finished my Labour of Love, the doing of [
      <span class="unclear">her?</span>]
       Biography has been the
      greatest imaginable comfort and solace to me,—in a sense it has given me
      another year of her companionship. To create a small literary monument to my mother<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp;
      this  such an
      one should be clothed in pretty dress has been my first consideration— &amp;
      cudos necessarily plays but a fractional part in it: as is always the case— 
   </p>
   
   <p>I should be glad to hear form you soon—as soon as you get this. Give my love
      &amp; best remembrances to them all at Glendale<sup><a href="#upa.00082_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup> when next you drive down: and tell me a little about yourself
      —your drives and friends. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I am immersed in proofs, correcting at the rate of a hundred pages a week. </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just finished reading Julian Hawthorne's interviews with Lowell,<sup><a href="#syr.00028_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      [
      <span class="unclear">that?</span>]
      
      
      wch
      
       the "Pall Mall" series is interested. I have been wondering what you would
      think of it? If there is anyone you would like me to send circulars to, name him or
      her, or if you would like to have anymore I will send some more. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I <u>believe</u> Rossetti<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r8">8</a></sup> holds still a small
      amount in trust. With best love and remembrances to my dear old loving Walt

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter

   <p id="loc.02174_n1">1. Whitman would later send

   <p id="n0199">2. Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>). For more, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_93.html">Dowden, Edward (1843–1913)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="loc.02174_n2">4. Whitman published his
      American Institute Poem, <em>After All, Not to Create Only</em>,
      with Roberts Brothers, a Boston publisher, in 1871.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0259">5. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="syr.00028_n3">7. Julian Hawthorne
      (1846–1934) was the son of Nathaniel Hawthorne and an American critic and
      journalist. In October 24, 1886, he published an interview with his mentor James
      Russell Lowell, in which Lowell apparently called the Prince of Wales "immensely
      fat"—a quote Lowell later publicly denied.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">8. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
