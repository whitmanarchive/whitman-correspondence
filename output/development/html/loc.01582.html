      <br></br><br></br>Dear Lewy,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will write you just a line, to let you know I have not forgotten you. 
      I am here on leave, &amp; shall stay nearly all this month. Duffy is here, 
      driving on Broadway &amp; 5th av. line. He has been up the Hudson river this 
      summer driving hotel coach. He is the same old Duffy. I have heard that 
      William Sydnor on 65, was laid up sick. I wish to hear about him, &amp; whether he is
      well, 
      &amp; again at work. If you see him, tell him I have not forgot him, but send him 
      my love, &amp; will be back in Washington again. Tell Johnny Miller<sup><a href="#loc.01582_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> there is 
      still a sprinkling of the old Broadway drivers left. Balky Bill,<sup><a href="#loc.01582_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> Fred Kelly, Charley McLaughlin, Tom Riley,<sup><a href="#loc.01582_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup> 
      Prodigal, Sandy, &amp;c. &amp;c. are still here. Frank McKinney<sup><a href="#loc.01582_n6" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; several other old 
      drivers are with Adams Express. Staging is rather dull.  
      
   </p>
