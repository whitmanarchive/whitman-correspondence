   <p>Thanks for your kind
      letter &amp; the nice gift<sup><a href="#loc.03478_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—the
      $10—which has safely reached
      me, &amp; is opportune—

      I did not know of any
      "pirated edition" in Chicago—Do you mean
      that some one has printed
      the book surreptitously
      there—&amp; is or has been
      selling it?<sup><a href="#loc.03478_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>

   <p id="loc.03478_n1">1. This postal card is
      addressed: P J O'Shea | Attorney &amp; Counselor | 163 Randolph Street |
      Chicago, Ill. This postal card is postmarked: (?) | 4 30 PM | (?) | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03478_n2">2. Probably the "nice gift"
      was payment for the two-volume edition, consisting of <em>Leaves
         of Grass</em> and <em>Two Rivulets</em>(1876). O'Shea's check
      for $10 is with Walt Whitman's letter.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03478_n3">3. The plates of the 1860
      edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, printed by Thayer &amp;
      Eldridge, were sold to Richard Worthington, who for many years printed them
      without Walt Whitman's authorization. The plates were purchased after Walt
      Whitman's death by his literary executors, Richard Maurice Bucke, Thomas B.
      Harned, and Horace Traubel.<a href="#r3">[back]
