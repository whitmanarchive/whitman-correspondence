   <p>I have been down here the past week right on the sea<sup><a href="#nyp.00502_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—am on the beach quite all day &amp; the surf sings me to sleep every night.
      John Burroughs is here—he leaves to-morrow morning for N Y, but I shall
      stay a few days longer. Am stopping at the Sheldon House &amp; like it
      well—very quiet here—fine weather—
