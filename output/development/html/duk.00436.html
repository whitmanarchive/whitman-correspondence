   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00436_n1">1. "June 29" is in Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to 1869, and Edwin
      Haviland Miller dated it to 1870 (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:368). Miller is correct. In the postscript, Louisa refers to Walt's "teedious
      thumb," and in five letters between June and August 1870 Louisa inquired about
      Walt's thumb. Therefore, this letter dates to June 29, 1870.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00436_n2">2. Fort Greene is the former
      name for the site that is now Washington Park. Fort Greene was opposite the
      longtime Whitman home on Portland Avenue near Myrtle, in which Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman resided with Thomas Jefferson Whitman and family for several years
      before their move to 840 Pacific Street in May 1866. Louisa had moved to the
      home on 101 N. Portland, in which she resided at the time of this letter, in
      spring 1869 (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter to Walt).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00436_n10">3. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman
      (1823–1908), Walt Whitman's sister. They lived in Burlington, Vermont.
      Foolscap is a large piece of paper that is used by artists for sketches. As
      writing paper, it may be divided into smaller pieces.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00436_n3">4. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor
      was the wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Walt Whitman's
      staunchest defenders. Walt may have mentioned a potential visit by Nelly and her
      daughter during his May visit to Brooklyn, though whether a visit came near this
      time is not known from his or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters. Walt Whitman
      dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington years, and he spoke
      often in his letters of their daughter Jean (called "Jenny" or "Jeannie").
      Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break off their friendship in late
      1872 over a disagreement about Reconstruction policies and the role of
      emancipated slaves, Nelly would remain friendly with Whitman. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00436_n4">6. The R. D. Wood Foundry was
      located in Florence, New Jersey. At this time, George Washington Whitman was an
      inspector of gas pipes. He would accept a position as inspector of pipes at the
      foundry in late 1869. See Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's , , and
       letters to Walt Whitman. See
      also Jerome M. Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>

      Duke University Press, 1975), 28.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">7. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r7">[back]

      the right margin, but they are only faintly visible in the digital image due to
      the curve associated with the binding. The text can be read easily in the
      original document.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00436_n8">9. Walt Whitman cut his thumb
      in late April or early May 1870, and it became infected. He referred to the
      injury in two letters from Brooklyn, a  letter to Walbridge A. Field and a second  letter to William D. O'Connor. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      inquired about or expressed concern for Walt's thumb in this and five other
      letters to Walt from May or June to July 1870: , , , , and .<a href="#r9">[back]
