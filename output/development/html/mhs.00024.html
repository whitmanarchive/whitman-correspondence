   <p><em>Correspondents:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>Jessie Louisa Whitman was the

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="mhs.00024_n2">1. Mannahatta (Hattie) Whitman,
      the poet's niece, died on September 3 and was buried three days later (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). George Whitman's wife Louisa
      went to St. Louis to be with Jeff and his other daughter, Jessie Louisa.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="mhs.00024_n1">2. Two "pot-boilers" were
      rejected: <em>Baldwin's Monthly</em> declined "Lafayette in
      Brooklyn," which Whitman sent on August 25 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles
      E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.), and Alden, of <em>Harper's
         Monthly</em>, refused "Some War Memoranda. Jotted Down at the Time" on . The latter was sent early in October
      to James Redpath, who, on , informed
      Whitman that Rice's syndicate "is dissolved," but that possibly he might put the
      piece into <em>The North American Review</em>, where it appeared
      in January, 1887. Whitman received $60 (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r2">[back]
