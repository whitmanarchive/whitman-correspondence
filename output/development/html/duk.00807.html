   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00807_n1">1. According to the
      Philadelphia <em>Press</em> on April 16, the lecture at the Opera
      House was preceded by a concert; the house was filled with guests, including Dr.
      S. Weir Mitchell, George W. Childs, Richard Watson Gilder, and Horace Howard
      Furness. With the lowering of the footlights, the stage was "in a half darkness
      save where in the centre the glow of the rose-globed study lamp cast its mellow
      light upon the August head of the poet as he bent over his pages." After the
      lecture Whitman read "O Captain! My Captain!" and "the audience remained seated
      until the poet dismissed them with an inclination of his massive head." Although
      Kennedy was writing enthusiastically about a book he proposed to do on the poet,
      Whitman evinced little interest. With his usual canny patience he bided his time
      until Kennedy "interpreted" his silence to mean that he wanted to see the
      manuscript. See the letter from Whitman to Kennedy of .<a href="#r1">[back]
