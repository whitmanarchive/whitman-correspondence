      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I expect you will be a little surprised to hear from me, when mother writes to you
      so
      often, but she has seemed so very anxious to see you lately and 
      wearies
      
       so much about you, that I thought I would urge the matter some 
      I hope that you will come as soon as you feel you are able I have been kind of miserable
      this
      spring, but am feeling pretty well again, and we have no trouble housekeeping, as
      an
      Aunt of mine, came to pay me a visit a week before I was sick, and when I was taken
      sick, she  very kindly
      stayed with us, and has taken all the care off my shoulders, so you will not be any
      trouble at all, come when you will. If you could only have been with us during your
      sickness I should have been glad.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mattie's sickness and death, and your trouble, has wearied mother a great deal this
      winter, and now she seems to be suffering from a nervous prostration. The doctor says
      it
      is not the dyspepsia, that her nerves are all out of order, she lays down sometimes
      during the day, but not often, and she is very tremulous, and discouraged about herself.
      Yesterday she seemed better, but 
      to day
      
       is quite miserable. How we all wish you were here, we think it would do her
      good
   </p>
   
   
   <p>George and Eddie are both well. It has been cloudy all day, with light rains, and
      in
      fact has rained for three days, the weather is enough to make one gloomy. Walt if
      you
      please 
      dont
      
       mention to mother when you write that you received this.
   </p>
   
   <p>George wanted me to urge your coming as soon as you could</p>

      With much love from all
      <br></br>Yours
      <br></br>Lou

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
