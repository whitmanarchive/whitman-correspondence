      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman,
      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>In order that your poem shall go into the February number of the Atlantic, it is
      impossible to risk the time it would take to get the proof to Washington and back.
      So I promise you the piece shall be read, word for word, and point for point, with
      your copy, which being in print, there is no chance for an error.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours always
      <br></br>James T. Fields

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James T. Fields (1817â€“1881) succeeded James
      Russell Lowell as editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1861
      and held the position until 1871. After Emerson, who had received "Proud Music
      of the Sea-Storm" in Whitman's 
      letter, delivered the poem to Fields, Fields sent $100 to Whitman on . He informed Whitman on  that if he was to get the poem
      into the February issue it would be impossible to send proof to Washington. This
      was the second of Whitman's poems to appear in the <em>Atlantic
         Monthly</em>; "Bardic Symbols" was published in 1861.(For "Bardic Symbols,"
      see Whitman's  letter to James
      Russell Lowell and Whitman's  letter
      to the editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>.)
