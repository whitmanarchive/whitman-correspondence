   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4137">2. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
