   <p>I feel quite set up this evening, have just got your good long letter of 1st, "The
      Melbourne Age" from you which I wanted much and which I have written to Melbourne
      for, and, even better than these, a most encouraging letter from Osler.<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r1">1</a></sup> He says he finds you "decidedly better", "brighter mentally and
      physically holding your own","the pain" he says points to "nothing serious" I think
      from what you say in yours of 1st that it was stomachic—dyspeptic—am
      glad to hear in any case  that it is passing off—hope it will be quite gone before this reaches you.
      I am mighty glad (quite relieved indeed) to hear that the Oct. Century has the
      hospital piece—your way is now clear for "N.B."<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r2">2</a></sup> We keep pegging away at the
      meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> but it goes slow—still I hope to have things in such shape as that I
      shall have to go East inside of two weeks. By that time my Annual Report will be in
      and I shall be able to get off. This is the eighth day that we have had rain
      (sometimes snow also) every day—it is cold and dull but I am feeling quite
      serene—we are all keeping well and things look bright ahead.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4302">1. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on
