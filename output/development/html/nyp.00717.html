   <p>Yr's of 9th just come;—Whittier's poetry<sup><a href="#n1029" id="r1">1</a></sup> stands for <em>morality</em> (not its <em>ensemble</em> or in any true
      philosophic or Hegelian sense but)—as filter'd through the positive
      Puritanical &amp; Quaker filters—is very valuable as a genuine utterance &amp;
      very fine one—with many capital local &amp; yankee &amp; <em>genre</em> bits—all unmistakably hued with zealous partizan anti-slavery
      coloring. Then all the <em>genre</em> contributions are
      precious—all help. Whittier is rather a grand figure—pretty lean &amp;
      ascetic—no Greek—also not composite &amp; universal enough, (don't wish
      to be, don't try to be) for ideal Americanism—Ideal Americanism would probably
      take the Greek spirit &amp; law for all the globe, all history, all rank, the
      19/20ths called evil just as well as the 1/20th called good (or moral)<sup><a href="#nyp.00717_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1029">1. John Greenleaf Whittier
      (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
      slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
      surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
      Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
      volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (various publishers: 1906–1996) and Whitman's "My Tribute to Four Poets,"
      in <em>Specimen Days</em> (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh &amp; Co.,
      1882–'83), 180–181.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00717_n1">2. Kennedy requested
      permission on  to quote Whitman's
      comments on Whittier; the poet wrote on Kennedy's letter: "don't know ab't
