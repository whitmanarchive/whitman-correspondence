      <br></br><br></br>Dear John Burroughs,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been back here two weeks &amp; over—My Washington jaunt occupied some seventeen
      or eighteen days, 
      &amp; was a very pleasant one for me—(started out with the idea of a two days visit only)—Am
      perhaps now lately 
      not so well, but not much different—the gravest trouble is the liver and stomachic
      business now—Still I keep 
      up about the same, (&amp; get mad at myself for <em>grunting</em>)—Your letter of two days since rec'd. 
      Best love to 'Sula, &amp; to Jenny Grant if there—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My new edition is nearly ready—Two Vols—will give you early advice of their appearance—only 100 copies issued—Is the <em>Winter Sunshine</em> out?<sup><a href="#nyp.00373_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Eldridge call'd to see me on his return home two weeks since. Marvin has gone to England, 
      with a Treas[ury] squad.<sup><a href="#nyp.00373_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> He has call'd on Mrs. Gilchrist. M. D. Conway<sup><a href="#nyp.00373_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> called on me. Lord Houghton<sup><a href="#nyp.00373_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> also.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have great times in <em>this house</em>—a baby has arrived,<sup><a href="#nyp.00373_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> a fine lusty little fellow, now five weeks old—(he has been named Walt)—just now
      though he is quite sick, but I opine will get along—The rest all very well, except
      that my sister, 
      the mother, is part of the time only middling. I hear young Walt raising <em>his</em> song, in the room overhead as 
      I conclude my letter—
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">Love to you, as always, my friend—
      <br></br>Walt.

   <p id="nyp.00373_n4">4. Richard Monckton Milnes
      (1809–1885), Lord Houghton, was an intimate of Tennyson and Thackeray as
      well as a poet. He was a collector of famous people; in <em>Dictionary of National Biography</em> he is characterized as "eminently a
      dilettante." Houghton wrote to Joaquin Miller on September 1, 1875, from
      Chicago: "Please give my best regards to Mr Whitman." On , Miller informed Whitman that he was trying to
      arrange a meeting with Lord Houghton. Houghton himself wrote to Walt Whitman on
       and proposed a visit at the
      end of October or early in November, and on , he asked whether November 6 would be convenient. These letters
