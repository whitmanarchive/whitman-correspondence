   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00596_n8">1. This letter dates to June
      22, 1870. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter June 22, and Richard
      Maurice Bucke added the year 1870. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's
      date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 2:362; 2:368). The year is correct and is
      consistent with President Ulysses S. Grant's expected appointment of Amos T.
      Ackerman as the attorney general after the resignation of Ebenezer R.
      Hoar.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00596_n1">2. Walt Whitman cut his thumb
      in late April or early May 1870, and it became infected. He referred to the
      injury in two letters from Brooklyn, a  letter to Walbridge A. Field and a second  letter to William D. O'Connor. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      inquired about or expressed concern for his thumb in this and five other letters
      to Walt from May or June to July 1870: , , , , and .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n4">3. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00596_n6">4. Charles Louis Heyde
      discouraged Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's visit to Burlington because she was
      "becoming too aged." He also wrote that it is "as much as Han can do to take
      care of herself" and that he had "paid off the mortgage on my house" (see
      Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, June 13, 1870, Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G.
      Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of
         Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University
      Press, 1949], 226–228).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00596_n3">5. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) served as the chief engineer of the Water Works in Lowell,
      Massachusetts, from 1870 to 1871. Davis took a degree in civil engineering at
      Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn
      Water Works until 1861. He was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to
      1865, after which he returned to Brooklyn. He would later serve as the city
      engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and as chief engineer of the American
      Telephone and Telegraph Company (1880–1908). A lifelong friend of Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman, Davis shared the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman, her son Edward, and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's family before
      Jeff's departure for St. Louis. For Davis's work with Jeff, see Jeff Whitman's
      , , and  letters to
      Walt Whitman. For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W. Howe,
      "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of Civil
         Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00596_n4">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized name. Joseph Phineas Davis had served as an
      assistant engineer with Jeff in St. Louis from 1867 to 1869. For more on Jeff,

      word "he" is written over an abandoned word or canceled.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">8. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00596_n9">9. Amos Tappan Ackerman
      (1821–1880) was born in New Hampshire, attended Dartmouth College, and
      spent his early adulthood as a teacher before studying law in Georgia. Though he
      opposed secession, he served in the Confederate army under General Robert
      Toombs. After the Civil War, he served in Georgia's state constitutional
      convention and was named U.S. district attorney. President Ulysses S. Grant
      appointed Ackerman to the office of attorney general after the resignation of
      Ebenezer R. Hoar on June 23, 1870 (see Mark Grossman and ABC-CLIO Information
      Service, <em>Encyclopedia of the United States Cabinet</em> [Santa
      Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2000], 81–82). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman followed the
      appointment of the attorney general closely because Walt served as a clerk in
      that office. The "awfull things said" about Ackerman, aside from his being an
      ex-rebel, may refer to an article that mocked him as an unknown: "The Senate
      could hardly be pleased, because it didn't know such a person was ever born" ("A
      Few Things," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, June 18, 1870,
      4).<a href="#r9">[back]
