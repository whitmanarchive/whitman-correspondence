      and yesterday and today we don't need a turkish bath to make us sweat. This is
      election day in Ontario. I have just voted. All is quiet here. My folks at the house
      are all well. I shall be pretty busy now for a while after my absence gathering up
      the ends of the strings and getting them in order in my hands
      again—fortunately for me I have good, honest, faithful, capable assistants. I
      trust you are rested after the dinner. You looked tired on Sunday morning or was it
      that you caught a little cold over night?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="loc.07350_n2">3. Whitman's birthday
      dinner was held 31 May 1890 at Reisser's Restaurant in Philadelphia. The main
      speaker was Col. Robert G. Ingersoll, and there were also speeches by Richard
      Maurice Bucke and Silas Weir Mitchell. The Camden <em>Daily
         Post</em> article "Ingersoll's Speech" of 2 June 1890 was written by Whitman
      himself and was reprinted in <em>Good-Bye My Fancy</em> (<em>Prose Works, 1892</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall, 2 vols. [New York:
      New York University Press: 1963-1964], 686-687). "Honors to the Poet" appeared
      in the Philadelphia <em>Inquirer</em>, 1 June 1890. See also the
      notes on Whitman's birthday party in the poet's  letter to Bucke.<a href="#r3">[back]
