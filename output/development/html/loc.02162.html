      <br></br><br></br>Dear Herbert
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Here I am at my room &amp; haunts in Camden, so different from the creek, &amp; bathing &amp;
      exercising in the open air<sup><a href="#loc.02162_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—yet I keep myself busy at one thing &amp; another—&amp; am feeling pretty well so far. (Yet
      I attribute my feeling pretty well now to my visits for the last year &amp; a half to
      the creek &amp; farm, &amp; being with my dear friends the Staffords.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We had a nice healthy ride up from Kirkwood, Mrs S and I, Friday 
      
      
      
      morning, &amp; I enjoyed it much—(am glad I came up that way, instead of the RR). I went
      over to your mother's yesterday afternoon about 5½ &amp; staid till after 8—nothing specially
      new with them—your mother &amp; Bee &amp; Giddy are all well &amp; in good spirits—We had a good
      tea,—I punished a fearful quantity of good oatmeal mush &amp; stewed blackberries—then
      we sat &amp; talked for an hour &amp; a half, in the cool of the evening on the front stoop—then
      a delightful jaunt home to Camden, a most lovely evening (the moon &amp; Jupiter in conjunction,
      &amp; I <u>speering</u> them all the way home &amp; especially on the river)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am partially busy at some writing—feel <u>most</u> <u>first</u> <u>rate</u> for me, to-day—Herb, you will see by the enclosed piece that J. Bur: is in Canada (or <u>en</u> <u>route</u> thither)<sup><a href="#loc.02162_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Write to me—
   </p>

      <br></br>Your old Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have written to-day to Mrs Stafford</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02162_n1">1. This letter bears the
      address: Herbert Gilchrist | Kirkwood | Camden County | New Jersey. It is
      postmarked: Camden | Jul | 22 | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02162_n2">2. Whitman was with the
      Staffords from July 13 to 20; he "came up in the light wagon with Mrs. S July
      20." (<em>The Commonplace Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). For an account of a scene with Harry Stafford, see Edwin
      Haviland Miller's introduction to <em>Walt Whitman: The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      3:1-9). Evidently Whitman was considering a trip to Washington, for on , Elmer Stafford, Harry's
      sixteen-year-old cousin, wrote to Whitman: "I would like to be with you all the
      time if i could. i would like very much to go with you on your trip to
      Washington."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02162_n3">3. John Burroughs wrote to
      Whitman on  after a three-week trip to
      Canada and a brief visit to Boston and Concord (<em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, ed. Horace Traubel [New York: Mitchell Kennerley,
      1914], 2:318–319). He was in Camden about the middle of September (see the
      letter from Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of ).<a href="#r3">[back]
