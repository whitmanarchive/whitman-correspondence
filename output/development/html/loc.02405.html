   <p>Because the time is short this must be abrupt, disconnected, fragmentary (perhaps)</p>
   
   
   <p>Your card and paper brought from P.O. yesterday.</p>
   
   
   <p>I have recovered from <u>that laziness</u> I complained of in spring or early summer. Do you know ones home or dwelling may
      be so situated with reference to open road, path to the spring, fields, pasture land,
      [
      <span class="unclear">garden?</span>]
       ground &amp;c that the position of out buildings, fences &amp;c are not well indicated? such
      has been mine. But my doubts being settled a little I can find occupation, and that
      will cure my sickening laziness—indeed several new steps are clearly indicated in
      my farm operations.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My crop is fair—my renters did so well by high, warm land early planted—my own cotton
      started off in early summer to slow and a July drouth coming on, the plant or "weed" was amazingly small, but it is mighty well filled
      with fruit.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Little Walt<sup><a href="#n3015" id="r1">1</a></sup> is a robust, healthy fellow—much so.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Perhaps I dont owe it to you, but to myself to explain—being so enthusiastic, why
      have I not before this <u>visited you</u>. Well I thought you were so sick it would be little satisfaction to you—then since
      the price of cotton went down so much 3 years ago and followed by two small crops
      of it then most all of a few hundred dollars owing to me is by a man who bought property
      largely in the flush times—I dont know when he can <u>conveniently</u> pay me (other creditors may be pressing)—I desire to see you sometime—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Of course I am only a farmer with no understanding of fine peoples' etiquette—I might
      be a sort of <u>elephant</u> in your hands (but I believe you and I laying our heads together could do almost
      anything—I dont know much of anything—I guess I possess about <u>the</u> <u>best</u> <u>rested</u> brain in the world—I thought early that I would not endanger my sanity or health
      by any hard study (I dont [
      <span class="unclear">win?</span>]
       I have ever <u>needed to know much</u>—yet I know you think I am solid and sound—I'd like to loafe with you in a country
      place or library or through a city's streets.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My <u>instinct</u> has always been against immortality; this a state of probation &amp;c
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>My idea has always been that this life is <u>for itself</u>, for itself.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Dignified appearance"—I swear I have on most all occasions of my life striven to
      be <u>un</u>-dignified. Somehow dignity (<u>apparent</u>) has been associated in my mind with selfish, resentful, misanthropic, un Democratic,
      un–brotherly feeling. I swear I have always most wished to be thought just and kind—been
      willing to be thought (if possible) a good natured fool. for simple ways, for restoring
      belief in what man sometimes is.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I've thought lately these pieces would make a good, orderly arranged little book by
      itself. 1—Carol of Words (<u>things</u> are the best teachers. 2. Open Road (exhortaition to free and abundant thinking and aspiration) 3. Brooklyn Ferry. 4. With Antecedents
      5 Carol of Occupations. 6 Broad Axe Poem.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A <u>small percentage</u> of the meaning of the Axe Poem escaped me till lately (it is grand)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have a young, poor farmer (of 26) new acquaintance, 1¼ miles from me studying Edition
      1871 after Burroughs' Notes<sup><a href="#n0834" id="r2">2</a></sup> and Eagle's flight<sup><a href="#prc.00050_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—he seems to get along well (with my clear explanations)—how long will he be <u>a Baptist</u>?
      
      
      He questioned me. These lines puzzled me always and I answered so—but instantly then
      this doubt or suspicion (<u>in talking with two men</u>) (<u>he</u> said what means "A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother &amp;c &amp;c
      &amp;c 3 lines"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>☞ A young man takes up W.W.'s book thinking he (the youth) <u>understands human nature</u> ☞ how can he? for "only after many years" &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c Am I right? the young must wait
      and become old (to be wise).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I've got my old renter the Methodist (local) preacher on Two Rivulets. I told him
      I never expected to convert him so great the <u>power of habit</u> in thinking but wanted to show him some of us are great and good. He doesn't wish
      to grant that a man possessing all virtues possible to the best Christian <u>could</u> be <u>good</u> if he lacked Christian belief and worship. Walt: the man is not at all a fool, but
      I think he makes not one person love him (except relationship)—what a curious cold-hearted
      unloving "reformer" he [
      <span class="unclear">is?</span>]
      . He goes through life (they say and he admits) dropping unpaid debts behind him—says
      he must withhold something to live on and <u>not starve</u>. Some say he's dishonest—but I hope he'll do nearly right with me—certainly he treated
      me respectfully and kindly years ago when he seemed to expect nothing. He never has
      family worship but grace at [

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.
