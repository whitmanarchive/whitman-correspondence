   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00898_n1">1. On May 10 Johnston and Wallace sent birthday
      greetings a gift of £10 (The Commonplace-Book and typescript: County Borough of
      Bolton (England) Public Libraries). Wallace wrote on June 27 to inform Walt
      Whitman that Johnston, who was not well, was coming to America to see the poet
      and to visit places on Long Island and in New York mentioned in Specimen Days
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). Wallace replied to Walt Whitman's card on
      August 1: "I have considered it one of the main privileges of my life (since my
      mother's death the main privilege of my life) to be able to communicate with you
      personally and to tender you my deep reverence and love" (typescript: County
      Borough of Bolton (England) Public Libraries).<a href="#r1">[back]
