      <br></br><br></br>Dear Comrade &amp; Dear Son
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter came this morning, &amp; as I think my loving boy is so touchy ab't it, (he says he has writ <em>three</em> letters, but I can't make out but <em>two</em>) I will sit right down &amp; send him a letter. I am feeling well—only as I was out with
      some friends Sunday night,<sup><a href="#nyp.00406_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I was foolish enough to take a good strong drink, &amp; eat a couple of slices of rich
      cake late at night—&amp; <em>I shan't do any thing of the kind again</em>. But I am pretty well, dear son, &amp; feel more able &amp; sassy every day—&amp; we will have
      some good times yet. Harry, I don't know the particulars about the Herbert scrape,
      but you must let up on him—I suspect you said something pretty tantalizing before
      he call'd you that—Let it go—Of course I shan't say any thing about it to any one—<sup><a href="#nyp.00406_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>There is quite a stir here in Camden to-day as the 6th New Jersey Reg't. is coming home this afternoon or evening, &amp; they are going to give the boys a reception
      &amp; sort of supper. A good many of the young fellows are friends of mine—I am invited,
      but it will be too boisterous for me, &amp; I shan't go—If you was here you should go,
      as it would suit you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish I was down by the pond to-day for a couple of hours, to strip &amp; have a good bath—It is very close &amp; hot here—</p>
   
   
   <p>There is a great rush now to the country—every train most is full—it is quite a sight
      to go to the ferry, Philadelphia side, &amp; see the stream of people, men, women &amp; children,
      old &amp; young, some really funny characters—I go once in a while &amp; take a look at the
      sight—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are all well—as soon as I finish this I shall go out for a couple of hours before
      dinner—(it is now between 11 and 12)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Here is an item about your old friend Mr Moore, of Bingham's school &amp; printing office:<sup><a href="#nyp.00406_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   <br><br><span class="indent"></span><span class="handshift">Henry W. Moore, Esq., formerly of the Philotechnic Institution of this city, and at
      present a resident of St. Louis, has been spending a few days with his friends in
      this vicinity, leaving Wednesday night for home. He intends departing, in company
      with Mrs. M., <em>nee</em> Vandergrift, one of our former school teachers, for Venezuela shortly, in the interest
      of St. Louis merchants.</span><br><br>
   
   
   <p>And here is one about the little girl that was run over, &amp; your father picked up &amp;
      carried home:
   </p>
   
   <br><br><span class="indent"></span><span class="handshift">Monday morning about 11 o'clock Lizzie Linkenheil, 6 years of age, living at 126 Market
      street, was run over in front of her home by a farmer's Sheldon wagon, loaded with
      truck, and instantly killed. George Sheer, the driver, was taken into custody and
      released afterwards by the Coroner. The child's father is a member of the 6th N. J. Regiment, and was absent with the command at the time.</span><br><br>
   
   
   <p>And here is one about your old Woodbury friend, I suppose</p>
   
   <br><br><span class="indent"></span><span class="handshift">The residence of Mr. Barber, editor of the Woodbury <em>Constitution</em>, at Woodbury, was discovered to be on fire about 9½ o'clock Sunday morning, and damaged
      to the extent of $1,000. The good folks of that delightful little place were about
      proceeding to church when the alarm was given, but they turned in nobly to save the
      furniture, which was removed little damaged.</span><br><br>
   
   
   <p>Good bye for a couple of days, my own loving boy. I shall look for you Thursday<sup><a href="#nyp.00406_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—

   <p>Harry, I want you to tell (above every one) your mother and father I have written
      to you &amp; that I send them my love particular, &amp; I will be down again one of these
      days—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00406_n1">1. August 7 was on Tuesday
      in 1877. Until August 12, Whitman remained in Camden, where Harry had visited
      him on August 4 and 5 (<em>The Commonplace Book</em>, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00406_n2">2. Probably with John
      Johnston and his friends. See the letter from Whitman to Johnston of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00406_n3">3. After staying with
      Whitman in Camden on August 4 and 5 (<em>The Commonplace
         Book</em>; see also the letter from Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist of ), Harry wrote from Kirkwood on : "Herbret cut me prety hard last night at
      the supper table, you must not let on if I tell you: he called me a 'dam fool,'
      I wasn't talking to him anyway! we was all talking of telegraphing, and father
      said he was reading of a man who was trying to overdo it and I said that I did
      not think he could do it and the[n] Herbret stuck in that, it did not fit very
      well, and if I had been near enough to smacked him in the 'Jaws' I would of
      doneit, you must not say anything about it to him or any one, he thinks he can
      do as he wants to with me but he will find out sometime [t]hat he is fooling
      with the wrong one. . . . I will be up to see you on Thursday to stay all night
      with you, dont want to go any wais[?] then, want to stay in and talk with you,
      did not get time to say anything to you when I sawe you, did not have time to
      say <u>scarcely</u> anything." See also the letter from
      Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of  and
      Edwin Haviland Miller's introduction to <em>Walt Whitman: The
         Correspondence</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1961–77)
      3:1-9.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00406_n4">4. Whitman pasted three
      newspaper clippings in his letter from the Camden <em>New
         Republic</em> of August 4.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00406_n5">5. There is no notation in
      <em>The Commonplace Book</em> of Harry's visit on Thursday,
      August 9. Whitman returned to Kirkwood on August 12 and, except for a flying
      visit to Camden on August 15, remained there until September 10.<a href="#r5">[back]
