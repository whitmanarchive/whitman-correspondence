   <p>I have been trying, since my return to Germany,<sup><a href="#n1027" id="r1">1</a></sup> to find out that essay you allude to
      in the N.A. Review article you sent me<sup><a href="#loc.05122_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—on the
      question 'Has America produced any great poet?' But as yet I have had no success.
      I
      fancy the thing fell through. There are very few ideas in Germany about American
      literature, past, present, or future. I got a few days ago a book called 'Aus dem
      Amerikanischen Dichterwald', by D<u>r</u> Rudolph Doehn. It has about 300 pages, &amp;
      professes, with justice, to be the first comprehensive properly historical and
      philosophical account of American literature, which it treats in 3 periods—the
      Colonial, Revolutionary and Literary epochs. It was greatly praised in an excellent
      German weekly paper, the Gegenwart.<sup><a href="#loc.05122_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I was much
      disappointed with it. There seemed to be a great lack of intelligence about
      it—no recognition at all that anything particularly American was to be
      expected of American literature; just the conventional praise and blame—plenty
      of the former, for such qualities as melody, elegance, fine sentiment, &amp;c. Doehn is
      rather celebrated in Germany &amp; has lived 12 years in America. He must be a rather
      wide-minded man, for he is not very greatly offended at you. But that's just
      it—he is so appreciative that a shock scarcely affects him and a vacuity
      affects him not at all. And his tone of mind is just that of his countrymen in general towards
      things American. He treats of you in a page, together with Stedman, Holland,
      Halpine, Winter.<sup><a href="#loc.05122_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> Here is what he says (I translate, as
      you 
      mayn't
      
       be familiar with German).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Not to be forgotten here is Walt Whitman, born on May 31st
      1819 in a farm village on Long Island, N. York—of whom the saying holds
      "He bears Eagles in his head, and buries his feet in the mire" (Er trägt
      Adler im Haupte und steckt mit seinen Füssen tief im Kothe.) His father was
      of English descent, his mother (Louisa van 
      Belsor, of Dutch origin.<sup><a href="#loc.05122_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> His brother, George M.
      Whitman served during the Civil War as officer in a New York Regiment. Sprung
      from a low social position (aus niedrigem Stande) W.W. was now farmer, now carpenter,
      now printer. Shortly before the outbreak of the civil war he
      composed, and set up with his own hands, his Leaves of Grass, a set of
      mystic-democratic poems which are rough and wholly without art, but not without
       strength
      and content (Inhalt, substance). W.W. often pays no regard whatever to the
      ordinary rules of morality and propriety (Anstand), but he does this, not from
      attenuated deficient moral sense
      (sittliche Verkommenheit), but because he regards the traditional observances of
      morals and propriety as contemptible and hypocritical formalities. During the
      civil war he was active for some time in the Sanitary Corps &amp; in the
      hospitals; and also received a post in the Home Department;—but his
      opponents, who saw in him a defender of "Free Love" were soon able to have him
      removed therefrom. His "Drum Taps" appeared in 1865—are poetical
      monologues on the war, suffer however, like almost all his compositions, from
      over-monotony (übergroßer Monotonie). Of decided poetic worth is his monody
      on Lincoln's death, beginning "When Lilacs" (&amp;c). The same may be said of the
      poem "Come up from the Fields, father"—in which a deep and warm
      feeling expresses itself in a manner which lays hold of the reader (in
      ergreifender Weise)."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So Herr Doehn. You see he does not even mention that in your works, for the first
      time on a large scale, English poetry is written without rhyme &amp; metre—a
      notable fact surely. (I forgot your predecessor Blake). This gives one an idea of
      his want of critical intelligence—of a large view of linked facts &amp;
      tendencies.—He touches on all American authors in this way, taking them one by
      one, giving life, and some brief criticisms; Emerson &amp; Thoreau get little mention.
      But the last division of the book consists of longer &amp; more detailed accounts of 6
      authors, viz—R. H. Dana, Whittier, Miller (Joaquin), Bryant, Longfellow,
      Bayard Taylor. Many poems are quoted in the original, and translated—but none
      of yours. This I
      am 
      surprized
      
       at, for they would go well in German. A project I contemplate &amp; would
      carry out as soon as I could find a proper German collaborateur, is a full German
      translation of the Leaves of Grass &amp; Passage to India. I fancy it would be most
      successful here, &amp; be largely understood. I believe Freiligrath has done some?<sup><a href="#loc.05122_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I always ask Americans about you here. Sometimes they say 'Oh yes, I heard of him
      from an Englishman some time ago.' But mostly it is blank ignorance, &amp; in neither
      case, interest.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose 'Calvin Harlowe' was never published? I have amended it, in accordance with
      a friend's advice, &amp; sent it to Kottabos, a magazine belonging to Trinity College
      Dublin, &amp; supported by (unpaid) present &amp; past students.<sup><a href="#loc.05122_n6" id="r7">7</a></sup> I write little poetry now but am trying to do a little in
      writing about German affairs for an Irish paper, &amp; give spare time to Greek &amp;
      Gaelic. My 'Encheiridion' ought to be out very soon as I have sent in the last proof
      sheets.<sup><a href="#loc.05122_n7" id="r8">8</a></sup> I want to try &amp; get it reviewed in
      America. Should I send a copy to the 'Herald' &amp; other papers? I should be much
      obliged if you would mention the names of two or three papers to which I might send
      such a work for reviewal. And another thing I should like to hear from you, is the
      name of the author of the best yet-written history of the American Civil War. I have
      read no history of it as yet—would you recommend Draper's?<sup><a href="#loc.05122_n8" id="r9">9</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>The address over this letter will find me for some months now.</p>
   
   
   <p>I hope you are well. I heard you were coming to England this year—I suppose
      that's not true.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1027">1. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05122_n1">2. The reference is to a
      footnote on p. 200 of the article "Poetry of the Future" in the February 1881
      issue of the <em>North American Review</em> (185–210): "A
      few years ago I saw the question, 'Has America produced any great poet?'
      announced as prize-subject for the competition of some university in Northern
      Europe. I saw the item in a foreign paper, and made a note of it; but being
      taken with the paralysis, and prostrated for a long season, the matter slipped
      away, and I have never been able since to get hold of any essay presented for
      the prize, or report of the discussion, nor to learn for certain whether there
      was any essay or discussion, nor can I now remember the place. It may have been
      Upsala, or possibly Heidelberg. Perhaps some German or Scandinavian can give
      particulars. I think it was in 1872."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05122_n2">3. The review of Dr. Rudolph
      Doehn's <em>Aus dem Amerikanischen Dichterwald</em> (Leipzig,
      1881) is to be found in <em>Die Gegenwart</em> of July 1881 (47).
      Although it praises the author for independent and impartial judgment, it
      recognizes that the work is not exhaustive and suggests changes in a second
      edition, with particular reference to the material on Bret Harte and Edgar Allan
      Poe.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05122_n3">4. These were prominent
      literary figures of the time. J. G. Holland was editor of <em>Scribner's Monthly</em>; Charles G. Halpine, a journalist and author of
      poetical and humorous writings; and William Winter, dramatic critic and
      poet.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05122_n4">5. This is Rolleston's error.
      Doehn's book contains the correct spelling, Louisa Van Velsor.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05122_n5">6. Ferdinand Freiligrath
      (1810–1876) was an early German Whitman enthusiast. He read the Rossetti
      edition of the poems while a political exile in Great Britain and published an
      enthusiastic account of them in the <em>Augsburger Allgemeine
         Zeitung</em>, 24 April 1868. He followed this article with some
      undistinguished and inaccurate translations from the Rossetti edition.
      Freiligrath's importance in discovering Whitman for Germany is to be attributed
      more to his critical appreciation of his work than to his translations.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05122_n6">7. <em>Kottabos</em>, first issued in 1874, is a miscellany of verse and prose
      including translations from Greek and Latin. The editor was R. Y. Tyrrell,
      Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and many of the contributors were present and
      former Trinity men. Rolleston frequently contributed translations and original
      poems to <em>Kottabos</em>. The second volume contains a poem by
      Rolleston, "On Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass'" (284–295), and a series
      of poems by John Todhunter written in "discipleship" of the "school of Walt
      Whitman" (14–16).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05122_n7">8. Rolleston's translation of
      the <em>Encheiridion</em> of Epictetus was published in
      1881.<a href="#r8">[back]
