      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your welcome letter reached me to-day. Yours from Washington of over two weeks since,
      
      also came safe. Since my letter of about three weeks since to Charles Eldridge—in
      which I wrote to you also<sup><a href="#nyp.00320_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I have not improved any—the distress in my head 
      has not abated—some spells are very bad indeed—(but it fluctuates, some days, 
      or parts of days, leaving me comparatively comfortable.) Nor can I walk any better—some
      of the time, not so well—My saving points are pretty good nights' rest, 
      and a fair appetite, digestion, &amp;c. Still I can see I am gradually being pulled, 
      and, though I have not at all given up hope of eventual recovery, I do not shut 
      my eyes to the other termination—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am very comfortable here, as I believe I told you, occupying mother's former rooms,
      
      (a north &amp; south one, second floor,) and with all her nice &amp; homely furniture 
      &amp; bed &amp; chairs—&amp; living day &amp; night in her memory &amp; atmosphere.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are having the hottest sort of weather here—in New York and Washington it must
      be terrible—but here I find I stand it quite well. I rec'd a note from John Burroughs
      telling me 
      of his flitting visit to Newport &amp; call on you. I have been waiting till I felt stronger,
      
      to go to Atlantic City (Jersey sea shore) or Long Island, but in my present condition
      
      feel it best to stay here—(Nelly, I don't feel as well as when you 
      used to come there to White's)<sup><a href="#nyp.00320_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I shall be glad indeed to have Charles Eldridge come here &amp; see me—&amp; it will be a
      <em>real disappointment</em> if he does not—but I count on his coming 
      <em>without fail</em>—I hope to get a letter from him soon.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I still manage to get out a little, towards evening—not always, but nearly every day—get
      to the ferry boat, &amp; sail to &amp; fro across the Delaware, occasionally—I had seen in
      the newspapers of William's appointment, &amp; was truly pleased—I hear from Peter Doyle
      quite regularly—he is well, &amp; working at his dangerous post 
      on the Baltimore &amp; Potomac RR—I miss him much—&amp; I miss you too, Nelly—I am very lonesome
      here, (&amp; yet I keep up very good heart)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If Charles Eldridge is there, I send him my love, &amp; the same to all—to your daughter
      Jeannie, (whom you do not mention) &amp; to your sister 
      &amp; the Doctor,<sup><a href="#nyp.00320_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; all who in good will enquire for me—It is now between 3 and 4 Saturday afternoon—I
      am sitting here in mother's great arm chair—we have had a hot day—but a breeze is
      springing up—it is a shady quiet spot here—I shall try to hobble out soon though I
      am quite feeble.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00320_n4">1. This letter is endorsed,
      "Ans'd." Its envelope bears the address, "Mrs. E. M. O'Connor, | Care of Dr. W.
      F. Channing, | Newport, | R. I." Its postmark is indecipherable.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00320_n1">2. Whitman refers to his  letter to Charles Eldridge, in which
      Whitman addressed a paragraph to Ellen O'Connor, advising her to "take this
      letter the same is if written to you."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00320_n2">3. Whitman stayed at the
      Whites' from March 1, 1871, until he left Washington. He had paid $236 in
      rent through June 10, 1873 (The Library of Congress #73). On November 28, 1873,
      Dr. George A. White, a chiropodist, acknowledged for his wife receipt of $28
      "on account . . . for rent of room etc from May 1st/73" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection). Whitman gave up one room at the Whites' on June 10, 1873: "Kept the
      other at $2.50 a month" (The Library of Congress #68). See also Whitman's
       letter to Peter Doyle, in which
      Whitman left instructions for the delivery of his boxes from the Whites'.<a href="#r3">[back]
