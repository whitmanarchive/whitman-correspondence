      <br></br><br></br>Mr Walt Whitman
      <br></br>Respected Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just read your 'Memorandum at a Venture' and wish to express to you my hearty
      concurrence with
      your grand fight for principle's sake.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am a student at the above institution and while studying my text books I have also
      studied the times. I believe that we are living in an age of wonders, an age at once
      preeminent for its
      practicality &amp; its shams. Strange anomaly. But it has ever been so. Seneca
      taught of the beauty of poverty while revelling in
      gardens of monarchical splendor. The Puritans, at home, denounced superstition &amp;
      persecution yet at Salem these very elements were the most conspicuous factors of
      their life. So
      today, in an age that despises the grand speculations of Plato and adheres to the
      practical Bacon, we see
      a nation, the strongest
      &amp; most prosperous of all time, bound in by shams. Shams in politics, religion,
      literature, art &amp; society. Yet to expose any of these and liberate a people from a
      thralldom, perhaps
      the lighter
      
       for their
      ignorance of its existence, is but to call down upon the head of the reformer calumny,
      scorn and blackmail. And above all, we see a grace in
      Cleveland which contains within its bosom the mortal of a man assassinated because
      he dared to
      hurl the powerful shafts of his executive
      office against the filthy shams of public life. And you, sir, are today threatened
      for aiming the first master stroke against the gorgon which is drinking our best
      blood and destroying the possibilities for the final perfection of our race.
   </p>
   
   <p>Sir, I bid you godspeed. And when time shall have rounded off your full allotment
      of years, and
      you shall have laid down the battle ax of social reform, Rest assured that there is
      one of younger years whose muscle
      though less
      strongâ€”is still determined and who will lift it up and carry on the fight for another
      generation.
   </p>
