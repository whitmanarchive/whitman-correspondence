   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4319">2. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n4983">3. David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n3999">4. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4188">5. Whitman often referred to <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888) as his "big book." With
      the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made the presswork and binding decisions,
      and Frederick Oldach bound the volume, which included a profile photo of the
      poet on the title page. Philadelphia publisher David McKay published the book in
      December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">6. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="loc.07570_n2">7. Whitman received $307.91
      from McKay, $5.59 being deducted for an unspecified reason (<em>The Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4144">8. Dr. Walsh was the brother of
      William S. Walsh (1854–1919), an American author and editor of <em>Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</em>. Richard Maurice Bucke
      arranged to have him accompany Dr. William Osler to see Whitman, since Bucke
      believed it would be useful to have a younger doctor examine the poet. See
