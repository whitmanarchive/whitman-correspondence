   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your welcome letter, and was happy to know that you had not forgotten me—for
      I have thought of you many times since. I returned here from New York about four weeks
      ago, 
      and have been and now am working in this office as usual—am well and hearty, 
      and don't hurt myself with hard work. Our hours are from 9 till 3.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You speak of coming here and paying me a visit. Dear boy, I hope you will come truly,
      
      for it would be a great comfort to me if we could be together again. I don't know
      whether 
      it would be very pleasant to you here, Jack, for this is a stupid place compared to
      New York—but we would have each other's society, and that would be first rate.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There's not much excitement in Washington—at least none that I take any interest in.
      
      Politics and politicians carry the day here—but I meddle with them very little. 
      In a couple of weeks more, Congress will meet, and then the city will be quite lively.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am out a good deal in the open air, as I have plenty of leisure time. 
      It is fine scenery around Washington—plenty of hills, and a noble river. 
      I take a ride on the cars out to Georgetown west, or Navy Yard east, once in a while
      
      of a pleasant afternoon, or Sunday—but I tell you I miss New York. 
      We had a long spell of splendid weather. But now it is colder, with some 
      snow a couple of days since. Jack, you must write often as you can—anything from my
      loving boy will be welcome—you needn't be particular about the writing—you might write
      in the car with pencil, when you have any time. I will write to you too. 
      I will now close for this time. Dear Jack, I send you my love.

   <p id="med.00403_n2">2. Jack Flood was a
      streetcar conductor in New York, known, according to an unidentified notation on
      his letter to Walt Whitman, as "Broadway Jack." According to date entries in an
      address book (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of
      Congress, Notebook #109), Walt Whitman saw Flood on September 30, 1868, and
      October 5, 1868, and rode with him on his Second Avenue car; Flood had been a
      conductor for ten years. After Walt Whitman's return to Washington, there was a
      brief correspondence, consisting of four extant letters from Walt Whitman (dated
      , , and )
      and one from the young man. Flood, somewhat better educated than some of Walt
      Whitman's other conductor friends, wrote on : "Sir, It is with great pleasure that I sit down with pen in hand
      to address a few lines to you." He informed Walt Whitman that he had lost his
      position on New Year's Eve and that he was now seeking another job: "I shall
      still continue to correspond and can never forget your kind friendship towards
      me.…Your True and Ever intimate friend." According to the first listing of
      his name in the New York Directory, in 1872–1873, he was at that time
      either in the milk business or a milkman.<a href="#r2">[back]
