      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mary Costelloe
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Sunny, cold, dry, very seasonable day, I continue on much the same—get out a
      little in wheel chair (but doubtful to-day—pretty sharp cold)—have quite
      rousing oak fire, &amp; great wolf skin fur on my big-limb'd ratan
      chair—Alys<sup><a href="#uva.00553_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> was here Sunday, &amp; I rec'd
      yesterday a nice letter<sup><a href="#loc.07750_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> f'm Logan<sup><a href="# loc.01350_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—a day or two before the "Spectator" f'm thy
      father<sup><a href="#n4979" id="r5">5</a></sup>—(so I am not neglected or
      forgotten)—Give my best thanks &amp; love to all—am writing a little
      (enclosed I fancy will be in Feb: <em>Century</em>)<sup><a href="#loc.07750_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup>—three slips, one for thy father—one for
      Logan—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Probably every thing in our great United States (now 42 of them) goes on well all
      in
      a monotonous &amp; matter of fact way—"blessed is that country that has <em>no</em> history"—we have an unprecedently humdrum
      President<sup><a href="#n4323" id="r7">7</a></sup> &amp; big men, but down in the myriad inner
      popular currents the moral &amp; literary &amp; pecuniary &amp; even political flow
      &amp; <em>good flow</em> are grand—we can console our hearts
      with that—on a great democratic scale the present &amp; here are probably
      ahead &amp; better than all time past, or any other land—<em>&amp; thats what America is for</em>—&amp; that satisfies
      me—that general unmistakable certain trend does—I dont mind little
      bothers &amp; exceptions &amp; some hoggishness—
   </p>

      Love to you all—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4979">5. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,

      was the twenty-third U.S. president and grandson of the ninth president, William
      Henry Harrison. Harrison was the Republican nominee who defeated Democratic
      incumbent Grover Cleveland in 1888. Whitman had very negative views of Harrison,
      once calling him a "scalawag" and a "shit-ass": "I never had any faith in him,
      in his course!" See Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.14.html"> Sunday, April 21, 1889</a>.<a href="#r7">[back]
