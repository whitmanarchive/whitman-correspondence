      letter. Every word good to know.

      course I should not have so many things my cloak for instance I must tell you again
      Walt you are first <u>first</u></p>
   
   
   <p>I have been working around this morning getting dinner &amp; so on wanted to write anyway

      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt
