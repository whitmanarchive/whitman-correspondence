      <br></br><br></br><u xmlns="">Dear Sir</u>,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was right glad to hear of you again through the medium of the newspaper, you so
      kindly sent me, I have been thinking of writing you a few lines these months past,
      only I was afraid your illness would prevent you 
      form
      
       feeling any interest in one so far away as me, and I also felt so deeply
      for you that I did not like to disturb the repose you seemed to need from your <u>Duty</u>. the enclosed papers will show you the use I have
      made of the paper, so that other English friends of yours should also learn the good
      news from Camden. Hope these few  Chapters upon you and your work may make your work and you more
      known to our working Classes the periodical in which they were published as
      principally its main subscribers amongst them. the Writer of them is a fellow of
      deep sympathy and has contributed from time to time some fine feeling and
      Sympathetic articles to its pages. the first one I noted was on W.Blake our Poet
      Artist of whom 
      Swineburne
      
       has written of so nobly and so well. I post these by
      letter (and send also two by newspaper Post,) so that I may feel somewhat certain
      some of them will reach you. I had some hopes of seeing you in our land, and 
      
      was delighted beyond measure when I saw in our papers our Tennyson had written to invite you to visit him, I also feel glad to be
      enabled to inform you that W.M. Rossetti's Edition has been <u>all sold</u>. and the 1872 are subscribed too by our English
      Publisher has also met with a good sale, of course in a way that is not very
      complimentary to English appreciation of your Work. I.E. by being sold in what is
      termed the <u>"remainder sale"</u> of course my own feeling
      respecting this is, it gives to people of small means an 
      oppertunity
      
       to possess a Book they otherwise would never have, "so out of evil cometh
      forth <u>good</u>" so saith the <u>Old
         Book</u></p>
   
   
   
   <p>last year I was down at oxford at the time 
      Emerson
      
       was there, I had no 
      oppertunity
      
       to speak to him of you, that as I did not think it wise to open the
      question at the times when I saw, I would gladly have done so, only I was not quite
      certain how he felt towards you, so as he did not name you out anytime I was in his
      company as a listener at Max Muller's, I thought it best to be
      silent, and while at oxford I wandered through the Marketplace (for I love to mingle
      with all kinds of my fellow men, but I [
      <span class="unclear">most?</span>]
       especially love country folk, fisher folk, and hard
      workers amongst our people I dearly love to mingle with and chat in their ways, and
      to enjoy a kind feeling of sympathy one with the other on these 
      occassions
      
      ,) well while I wandered here and there I saw a stout wellbuilt man in a
      small shop selling paper and when I looked at his <u>wares</u> I
      saw thereon your Family name, so felt a desire to talk with him. I bought small
      paper then had small talk and he said the only persons he Knew bearing the name
      lived at Egham in Surrey and 
      where
      
       mostly Market Gardners.  and one branch of the family had been Stewards of the Duke of
      Richmond, and one had emigrated to America some distant relation of his family years
      ago, but they had never heard any news of them—so when I told him there was
      such a name in America owned by a family there and one of them was a poet, he
      thought perhaps it might be possible you 
      where
      
       a 
      desendant
      
       of that distant relative. he was quite a build of man like you, a noble
      large bodied and large featured man, full of seeming good honest purpose in his
      nature, and more like a farmer than a humble Stationer, so that he did honour to the
      Stock, though not exactly in his trade. he was a type of man I like to see, only he
      seemed rather confined in his ideas of Books.—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I sent to him some small notice of you and your work, from Chambers paper, but I
      never received any reply, so feel afraid your work is not of a kind to suit his
      tastes. I note also recently your Poem on Lincoln has been read in London at a 
      Liberary
      
       Association, so slowly though I suppose and hope certainly will you become
      known to us more widely and truly. Well I must conclude this rambling note, with a
      hearty wish that you will be once again able to do some more work for our race and
      help on the Life, that our hope is, yet shall <u>be</u>. Ruskin
      is also working hard too to help on a nobler life, and one not much unlike the one
      you also long to see. so many souls labouring for one end must someday effect the
      accomplishment of the "Golden Days" so long sung, so long toiled for, prayed
      for—and fought for!!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Dixon (1831–1880), a corkcutter of
      Sunderland, England, was one of Walt Whitman's early English admirers. In 1856
      he had bought copies of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> from a book
      peddler; one of these copies was later sent by William B. Scott to William
      Michael Rossetti. Dixon vigorously supported cultural projects and represented
      the ideal laborer of John Ruskin, who printed many of his own letters to the
      corkcutter in <em>Time and Tide</em> (1867). See <em>Autobiographical Notes of the Life of William Bell Scott</em>, ed. W. Minto
      (1892), II, 32–33, 267–269; Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt
         Whitman in England</em> (1934), 15–17; <em>The Works of
         John Ruskin</em>, ed. E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn (1905), XVII,
