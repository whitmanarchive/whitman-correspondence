      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your card was welcomed the other day; but I was sorry it did not give a better
      account of your present condition. I hope the bright American autumn weather will
      serve you better than the summer has done,—bringing a renascence of the
      imagination at least.
   </p>
   
   <p>If in imagination you could only come to this Welsh mountain valley, &amp; go
      exploring some of its mountain sides &amp; its swift streams with me in this
      splendid October sunshine,—this alone would be a sufficient 
      medecine
      
       for the soul surely! I suppose these late weeks here have been the
      happiest of my life,—in the sense of physical delight at any rate; &amp; the
      keen pure air makes one mentally alert &amp; energetic too. A good  part of every
      day goes in excursions across the mountains, but I usually write in the mornings
      &amp; evenings—of necessity, &amp; so get through a fair amount of work.
   </p>
   
   <p>The life of the farm, which you know so well in the States, is essentially the same
      here no doubt. Harvest is late this year, &amp; on some farms the corn is not yet
      all gathered in; but here at Blaen Sawdde, the two energetic sons of the house
      working under the shrewd &amp; restless direction of their father, the last field
      was stacked ten days or more ago. Old William Williams,<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r2">2</a></sup> the father, is a typical
      Welsh peasant of the better class. He is just seventy years old, &amp; except for
      indigestion &amp; occasional rheumatism, is very hale &amp; strong for his age, as I
      found out one day soon after coming here, when he took up the hatchet to show me how
      to chop a log of wood in two. Of the two sons now at home, the eldest David<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r3">3</a></sup> is about
      34 years old, &amp; William<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r4">4</a></sup> about 25.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Like most Welshmen, they are both good singer's, &amp; take bass in the parish church
      on Sundays. William moreover is a remarkably comely &amp; well-built youth, without
      an evil trick in his whole nature. It is really inspiring to see him at work: he
      does everything with such ease &amp; strength. And he is equally quick mentally, and
      reads English &amp; Welsh readily &amp; with imagination. I almost envy him his
      self-reliance &amp; manly sufficiency.
   </p>
   
   <p>Two days ago quite a momentous event,—the bi-annual sale by auction of sheep,
      cattle &amp; mountain ponies, took place at the farm, &amp; some hundreds of farmers
      rode across the mountains &amp; from the surrounding hamlets to attend it. The sight
      of so many sturdy countrymen, with their ponies &amp; beautiful collie dogs, would
      have delighted you greatly. A plentiful supply of Welsh ale &amp; beef &amp; mutton
      &amp; other things made a feast quite Baronial, &amp; put them all into good humour.
      In the evening the younger fellows wrestled on  the grass until the new moon sank 
      behind the hills &amp; it was too dark to see any longer. Later they sat round the
      fire, &amp; sang &amp; told stories,—all in Welsh of course, &amp; some score
      or more of them did not return home, but stayed here &amp; sat up all night,
      continuing the fun. Altogether a fine experience for me, as you may imagine. Every
      day I gather in this way some new association to add to my store; &amp; all the
      while I am picking up the Welsh idiom, difficult as it is, &amp; hope in a month or
      two to be able to read the old Welsh MSS. poetry &amp; romances chiefly at the
      British Museum.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad to think that <u>November Boughs</u><sup><a href="#n3999" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; the complete
      900 page volume<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r6">6</a></sup> are so nearly ready, &amp; look forward to having them. It is within
      the bounds of possibility that I may write a review of the complete book for one of
      our leading monthlies,—the XIXth Century<sup><a href="#loc.03334_n2" id="r7">7</a></sup> or Fortnightly Review;<sup><a href="#loc.03334_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup> but I must not be too sure.
   </p>
   
   <p>If Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r9">9</a></sup> is with you, give him greetings. &amp; Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r10">10</a></sup> too.
   </p>

      With much love,
      <br></br>Ernest Rhys
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall probably stay here two or three weeks more, &amp; then go to London after
      a short stay in the Vale of Avallon in Somerset.

      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
