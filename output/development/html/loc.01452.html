      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I see from the Westminster Review of our Country, that you have issued a new Edition
      of your Poems. I want to know if the new Poems are to be purchased separate. I would
      fain make my own Copy complete to the present times, so would thank you for a line
      giving me some particulars respecting the new Poems so that I may know how to order
      them from by Bookseller.—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I note that in them you have been in New York lately and that its ways and people
      don't please you. [
      <span class="unclear">even?</span>]
       these changes in people are precisely of that character that I
      thought you had already expected such and in fact are of the greatest feature in
      your Poems to me, was your acknowledgement of the existence of such peoples, and
      also your indication how such peoples originated in such States as your States. Now
      the question to me is this. Can these people help themselves being that which they
      are? Does not the artificial Life in all large Towns create and breed such people?
      You who have seen &amp; may write almost <u>all People</u>,  and have watched the
      growth of these changes seems to consider all such changes as inevitable, and that
      also is marked too in your Poems. So I pray you someday give us a clear estimate on
      this question of Life. What Life is the best for People? A Town one with every so
      called comfort, and Art and Luxury? But why need I ask when I see now before my
      minds eye several passages in your Poems that answer all the questions and that too
      in an emphatic way. yet I like yourself still keep putting the Questions to all I
      Know and to myself whenever I wander in the Streets or mix with those that Farm the
      lands or till There. Well over and above all I often have been wondering how the
      Books I sent you turned  out as you read them, how did the curious Book on Indian Philosophy? answer the
      yearning you seem to have to know something about them, how did the Life of Bewich
      or Carlyle<sup><a href="#n0139" id="r1">1</a></sup> please you, to it make you feel an interest in these
      men? How did the Indian Theists utterance with its mixture of Western ideas meet
      your own thoughts on his Themes. How did Mazzinis<sup><a href="#n0204" id="r2">2</a></sup> small but yet
      great Book tally with your own teachings of your own people. There was so much
      representative ideas in these small Books that I yearn to know how it all appeared
      to you, and if it was to you the truth it seems to have been to me in thus sending
      to you, as my feeling was they would be as dear to you also.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Since last I wrote you again as war and even Revolution once more been tried in
      France in the attempt to found a new Social State the Dream it seems to me of
      Humanity in all Ages. There is not a Literature I have read that some such a Social
      State was not foreshadowed by some of its great Men in their writings. And also how
      sorrowful to write after all the bloodshed this noble idea is still a Dream, except
      in as far as your Land proves it not so, by the few noble and successful
      associations that seems to grow and flourish in same portions of your great Country—
       proving the idea
      is no dream but a veritable Truth awaiting the full growth of Humanity in all its
      true fulness for the fulfillment of such a truly noble form of Social Life for all
      Peoples!!—true comrades men and women such as you sing in your Poems. there again
      you see I find fresh spirit for my dream in your own work and that our latest
      utterance of hope for us in Human Life. I know that all these months of horror will
      have been often pondered over so wonder if in these ponderings speech or written
      thought has been made thereon.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Dixon (1831–1880), a corkcutter of
      Sunderland, England, was one of Walt Whitman's early English admirers. In 1856
      he had bought copies of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> from a book
      peddler; one of these copies was later sent by William B. Scott to William
      Michael Rossetti. Dixon vigorously supported cultural projects and represented
      the ideal laborer of John Ruskin, who printed many of his own letters to the
      corkcutter in <em>Time and Tide</em> (1867). See <em>Autobiographical Notes of the Life of William Bell Scott</em>, ed. W. Minto
      (1892), II, 32–33, 267–269; Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt
         Whitman in England</em> (1934), 15–17; <em>The Works of
         John Ruskin</em>, ed. E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn (1905), XVII,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0139">1. Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) was a Scottish
      writer who wrote frequently on the conflict between scientific changes and the
      traditional social (often religious) order. For Whitman's writings on Carlyle in
      <em>Specimen Days</em>, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf087v1">Death of Thomas Carlyle</a>" and "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf088v1">Carlyle from American Points of View</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0204">2. Italian politician Giuseppe Mazzini
      (1805–1872) released <em>Doveri dell'uomo</em> (<em>The Duties of Man</em>) in 1860. In it, Mazzini emphasizes the
      importance of education to a unified nation and argues that man's duty to the
      nation is second only to duty to God.<a href="#r2">[back]
