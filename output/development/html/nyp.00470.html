      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of 15th 
      rec'd<sup><a href="#nyp.00470_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—J[ohn] B[urroughs] had written
      to me for the letter—he heard of it from Dowden himself)—Yes I too think
      D's words "sweet and beautiful"—I read yesterday the Dec. "Nineteenth Century"
      article (Josiah Child, of Trübner's, mailed me in sheets)—&amp; like it
      much—<em>You</em> may not, on 
      acct
      
       of the author's <em>John Bull reservations</em>, but I think it decidedly the best
      English (or any foreign) criticism yet printed. I will send you a copy (of the cheap
      N Y reprint) in two or three days—it was not ready last night—
   </p>
   
   <p>William, as you are going to collect the "Tribune" letters, &amp;c.<sup><a href="#nyp.00470_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I suggest that <em>you ask Dr Bucke to
         give up the</em> "Good Gray," &amp; you <em>include
         it</em>—make a cluster of <em>all</em> you have written (Have
      you the "Times" article you 
      furnish'd

      Dec:
      
       1866?<sup><a href="#nyp.00470_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      I have a copy, &amp; can send you)—I think it would be just as well for you to
      so include, as Dr B has enough otherways—I hope you will like the
      idea—shall I ask Dr. B to give it up? there is something to me quite
      preferable in these <em>collectanea</em> at first hand for a life,
      affair, even history, out of which the modern intelligent reader, (a new race
      unknown before our time) can take and adapt &amp; shape for him or herself—I
      send you the "Critic" with my piece on Burns<sup><a href="#nyp.00470_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Cold, cold—but very bright &amp; sunny here to-day—I am well as
      usual—Wonder how the Heywood trial will eventuate—Somehow I feel clear
      that <em>however</em> it goes, we will "pluck the flower" &amp;c
      &amp;c from that <em>however</em>—So you must not feel anxious a
      bit—T W H Rolleston at Dresden, Saxony (with one or two German scholars) is
      translating L of G. into <em>full German version</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00470_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—expecting it to be ready next spring—He is
      an Irish gentleman, a college man, about 30 I think, married, &amp; I suppose of
      some fortune—What I know of him (by quite considerable correspondence) I like
      much.
