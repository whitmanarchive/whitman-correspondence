   <p>I am well as usual—have been out in Germantown on a few days' visit—have
      taken long rides &amp; explorations along the Wissahickon, Indian Rock, &amp; all

   <p id="nyp.00472_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service—Treasury | Washington | D C. It is

   <p id="nyp.00472_n2">2. A three-volume edition of
      Molière, translated by Henri Van Laun, is now in the Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of Congress,
      Washington D.C.). Interestingly, it was published in 1880 by Worthington.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00472_n3">3. From December 23 to 25
      Whitman spent a "pleasant time at R. Pearsall Smith's and his wife Mrs Hannah W
      Smith (&amp; dear daughter Mary) at 4653 Germantown avenue . . . the fine, long,
      spirited drives along the Wissahickon, the rocks and banks, the hemlocks, Indian
      Rock—Miss Willard, Miss Kate Sanborn, Lloyd Smith (R P's brother) the
      librarian" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Feinberg Collection). Whitman was again
      with the Smiths from December 30 to January 2 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Mary
      Smith, a student at Smith College, forced her somewhat reluctant family to visit
      the poet. Her father became very fond of Whitman, who, however, never "hitched"
      with his wife, a famous Quaker leader (1832–1911). Hannah Smith was not
      impressed with the poet's Hicksite leanings or his verse. Whitman was very fond
      of the other two Smith children, Alys and Logan Pearsall (1865–1946).
      Lloyd Smith (1822–1886) was a publisher and a librarian. See Logan
      Pearsall Smith, <em>Unforgotten Years</em> (Boston: Little, Brown
      and Company, 1939), 92–108, and <em>A Religious Rebel: The
         Letters of "H. W. S." (Mrs. Pearsall Smith)</em> (London: 1949),
      xvii–xviii. Whitman's visit to the Smith family is also discussed in Jon
      Miller, "'Father Walt': Frances Willard and Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 28 (Summer/Fall 2010),
      54–60.<a href="#r3">[back]
