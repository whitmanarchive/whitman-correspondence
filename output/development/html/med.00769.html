   <p> I am going out to a small dinner party of friends,<sup><a href="#loc.07038_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp;
      am sitting here in my 3d story room waiting for half an hour— 
   </p>  
   
   <p> —I have not heard from your folks directly—but a man at the ferry, (a
      relation of Joe Brownings) told me that "Debbie had had
      a baby, &amp; that it was buried last Sunday."<sup><a href="#loc.07038_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I asked
      him how Debbie was getting along since, &amp; he said he believed pretty
      well—but I suppose you have heard more fully &amp; exactly from
      home—Nothing else to write about specially—we have had over three weeks
      of severe winter weather, storms &amp;c—many wrecks on the coast—I am
      glad you keep well &amp; in good spirits—pray God it may continue so, &amp;
      believe it will—Good bye for this time, dear Hank—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07038_n1">1. Morley C. Roberts
      (1857–1942) was a well-travelled English novelist who had visited, among
      other places, Australia and South Africa and incorporated elements from his
      trips into his fiction.<a href="#r1">[back]

      Whitman responding to Roberts, he did call the letter "fragrant and beautiful"
      when discussing it with Horace Traubel (<em>With Walt Whitman in
