      <br></br><br></br>Dear Rudolf Schmidt<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n0793" id="r1">1</a></sup>,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The Danish edition <em>Demokratiske Fremblik</em>, of my Democratic
      Vistas<sup><a href="#n0189" id="r2">2</a></sup>, has reached me to–day, (one copy, complete,
      paper–bound, and two instalments of loose sheets)—makes a handsome little book,
      very neatly &amp; appropriately printed &amp; bound—It is a great, deep, joy to me to
      be thus in communion with thoughtful &amp; democratic men &amp; women in the Scandinavian
      countries—I think much, much of it—&amp; of you as the medium of it. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you 
      rec'd
      
       my letter from here of Jan. 25—about my illness, paralysis—(&amp; the
      papers I sent giving some details of it.) I am still unwell—Cannot work any—
      To–day
      
       I send you <em>Harper's Magazine</em><sup><a href="#n0290" id="r3">3</a></sup> for
      February, with a piece<sup><a href="#rlc.00009_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> I have written to idealize our great
      Pacific half of America<sup><a href="#n0578" id="r5">5</a></sup>, (the future <em>better
         half</em>)—also a N. Y. <em>Tribune</em>, with a poem, (my latest,) <em>Prayer of Columbus</em>.<sup><a href="#rlc.00009_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> So you will see I
      cannot desist from writing, sick or well. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Clemens Petersen I see his pieces occasionally in the magazines—I have sent you one
      or two, formerly—I only met him that time, over two years ago, I mentioned<sup><a href="#rlc.00009_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup>—have not seen any thing of his lately in print. You speak of
      a jaunt or tour in Germany—O how I should like to be with you &amp; go around with
      you, in some of those quaint old cities &amp; spots—the motherhood, (or rather
      grandmotherhood) of so much in this New World. Don't fail, my dear friend, to write
      me at
      least as soon as you return. Mention whether you have 
      rec'd
      
       the paper, (N. Y. <em>Graphic</em>) with 
      acc't
      
       of my illness<sup><a href="#rlc.00009_n4" id="r8">8</a></sup>—also February <em>Harper's</em>, and the <em>Tribune</em>, by this mail—I like to hear
      specifically whether the papers and letters I send, reach you all right—address me
      here, Camden, N. Jersey, until further notice. (On papers, printed matter, &amp;c. don't
      write any thing on wrappers, but only address, as our post office law strictly prohibits
      it.) 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I am laid up here, very lonesome, your letters will be doubly welcome. I am saving
      up
      for you some pieces on <em>American humor</em>, which I will send, when ready.
      About <em>Demokratiske Fremblik</em> I shall next time have something further
      to say. I enclose in Harper's, two copies, proof of my portrait—wood engraving,<sup><a href="#rlc.00009_n5" id="r9">9</a></sup> rough but good, lately made—looks quite like me—(for
      all my sickness, which is pretty serious, I keep much the same in flesh &amp; face.) It
      is
      mild &amp; pleasant here to–day as I write, middle of the day—I am sitting here
      with open doors, the bright sun shining—Don't fail to write me—try to take some
      time of an hour's leisure—I like to hear about your people there—about the
      lady<sup><a href="#rlc.00009_n6" id="r10">10</a></sup> you spoke of who was interested in <em>Democratic Vistas</em>—&amp; the Professor<sup><a href="#rlc.00009_n7" id="r11">11</a></sup> you once
      wrote of also—about Bjornsen also.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0793">1. Rudolf Schmidt, a Dane and
      editor of <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em>, is credited with
      introducing Walt Whitman to Scandinavia by quoting translated passages from <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in a 1872 essay in his magazine. He wrote
      to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871:
      "I intend to write
      an article about yourself and your writings in the above named periodical which
      is very much read in all the Scandinavian countries. ... I therefore take the
      liberty to ask you, if you should not be willing to afford some new
      communications of yourself and your poetry to this purpose" (The Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0189">2. Rudolph Schmidt translated Whitman's <em>Democratic Vistas</em> into Danish in 1871.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0290">3. <em>Harper's Monthly Magazine</em>
      (sometimes <em>Harper's New Monthly Magazine</em> or simply <em>Harper's</em>) was established in 1850 by Henry J. Raymond and
      Fletcher Harper. The magazine published several of Walt Whitman's poems,
      including "" and "." In 1857, Fletcher Harper founded <em>Harper's Weekly</em> (subtitled "A Journal of Civilization"),
      which gained its fame for its coverage of the Civil War and its publication of
      cartoonist Thomas Nast's (1840–1902) work. For Whitman's relationship with
      these two publications, see "" and "."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00009_n1">4. "Song of the Redwood-Tree."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0578">5. In a ,
      letter, Walt Whitman offered "Song of the Redwood-Tree" to Henry M. Alden,
      editor of <em>Harper's Monthly Magazine</em>. Of "Song of the
      Redwood-Tree" Rudolf Schmidt observed: "It is your old great theme in a simple
      and powerful stile, embracing the holy and original nation of the far West"
      (Syracuse University; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], 4:464). For digital images of the poem as it
      appeared in <em>Harper's Monthly Magazine</em>, see "."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00009_n2">6. In reprinting the poem on February 24,
      1874, the <em>Tribune</em> commented that it "shows the brawny
      vigor, but not the reckless audacity, by which the name of that wild poet has
      become best known to the public."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00009_n3">7. Whitman mentioned this meeting in his  letter to Schmidt. Schmidt pressed
      Walt Whitman for his opinion of Petersen, as in his letter of : "I have asked you at least two
      times how you did like Clemens Petersen; you have not replied and most probably
      you wont speak of this matter. If that is the case, I shall repeat the question
      no more."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00009_n4">8. Walt Whitman referred to an article in the
      <em>Daily Graphic</em> of January 23, 1874, in which C. F.
      presented "A Biographical Sketch—An American Poet Graduating from a
      Printer's 'Case.' "<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00009_n5">9. Linton's engraving appeared in the 1876
      edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00009_n6">10. Roos suggests the reference is perhaps to
      Nathalie Zahle, a reformer of Danish female schools; see <em>Orbis
         Litterarum</em>, 7 (1949), 49n.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00009_n7">11. Roos proposes two
      possibilities—Falbe Hansen and Rasmus Nielsen.<a href="#r11">[back]
