      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>                
   
   <p>Looking over a file of papers in the reading room I saw a paragraph about your
      dismissal from the Interior Department, and as I once read your book, I am moved
      to express my feelings in the matter. The act strikes me as pretty mean but
      quite of a piece with Harlan's<sup><a href="#nyp.00223_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> character. As I
      see you are in the Atty Gen'l's office I will call on you when I come to W. in a
      few days and tell you <em>in confidence</em> a little transaction
      I once had with Harlan, long time ago, which will show you what kind of chap he
      is. I read your book when it first came out and though I must admit a good deal
      of it was blind to me, I saw considerable which struck me as first class, though
      I don't pretend to much judgment in such matters. Anyhow I didn't see anything
      worse in what Harlan makes so much of than what is in old Bill Shakespeare and
      the Bible, and dashed in pretty thick too. Some folks are more squeamish than
      me, though.—Perhaps you might like to hear something Mr. Lincoln once said
      of you, which you probably never heard of. It wasn't much to say, but the way he
      said it struck me a good deal. It was in the winter time, I think in '64 I went
      up to the White House with a friend of mine, an M. C., who had some business
      with the President. He had gone out, so we didn't stop, but coming down stairs,
      quite near the door we met the President coming in and we stept back into the
      East Room and stood near the front windows, where my friends had a confab with
      him. It didn't last more than three or four minutes, but there was something
      about a letter which my friend had handed the President, and Mr Lincoln had read
      it and was holding it in his hand like one thinking it over, and looking out of
      the window when you went by, quite slow, with your hands in the breastpockets of
      your overcoat and a sizeable felt hat on your head pretty well up, just as I
      have often seen you on Broadway. Mr. Lincoln asked who you were, or something
      like that. I spoke up and said, mentioning your name and that you had written
      "Leaves of Grass," etc. Mr. Lincoln didn't say anything but took a good long
      look till you were quite gone by. Then he says—(I cant give you his way of
      saying it, but it was quite emphatic, and odd), "Well," he says, "<em>he</em> looks like a <em>man</em>." He said it
      pretty loud but in a sort of absent way and with the emphasis on the words I
      have underscored. He didn't say any more but began to talk again about the
      letter and in a minute or so, we went off. Seeing your name just now in the
      paper put me in mind of it it and I thought it was an item you might like to
      know. It was the only time I spoke to Mr. Lincoln though I saw him often.
   </p>                
   
   <p>I expect to be in Washington on my way down South in a few days and will take the
      freedom of giving you a call. Please don't mention my <em>name</em> in connection with what I write about Harlan. I'll explain why
      when I see you and you will see the reason for not spreading it round.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00223_n1">1. James Harlan
      (1820–1899), secretary of the interior from 1865 to 1866, dismissed
      Whitman from his second-class clerkship on . Harlan apparently took offense at the copy of the 1860 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> which Whitman was revising and which he
      kept at his desk. With the help of William Douglas O'Connor and Assistant
      Attorney General J. Hubley Ashton, Whitman secured a position in the attorney
      general's office. The Harlan episode led directly to O'Connor's pamphlet "The
      Good Gray Poet." Although Harlan was a Methodist, he was not a parson. Whitman
      may have sarcastically applied this term to Harlan because on May 30, 1865,
      Harlan had issued an official directive asking for the names of employees who
      disregarded "in their conduct, habits, and associations the rules of decorum
      &amp; propriety prescribed by a Christian Civilization" (Jerome Loving, <em>Walt Whitman's Champion</em> [College Station: Texas A&amp;M
      University Press, 1978], 57).<a href="#r1">[back]
