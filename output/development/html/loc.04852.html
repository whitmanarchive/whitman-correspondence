      My dear Sir.
      
      
   </p>       
   
   <p>The editor of the Girl's own Paper a magazine, circulating about a quarter of a million
      copies, has asked me to 
      supplement, a series of articles on "Some Poets Oversea, by a chapter on <u>Walt Whitman</u>.
      This paper goes to the homes and hearts of the outside public, and I 
      wondered if I dared to ask you which of all your noble messages, you 
      would like specially brought to their notice.
   </p> 
   
   <p>In a late work on the lighter forms, known as Ballades, Rondeaus &amp;, the 
       
      <u>Athenaeum</u>, in a review by 
      mr Theo. Watts,<sup><a href="#loc.04852_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> after [
      <span class="unclear">many?</span>]
       
      columns of kindly notice advised me to turn 
      to your works as antidote—not dreaming perhaps—that in years of 
      study of the petty pretty trifling of the debonair school. 
      Your poems with <u>Omar Khayyaim</u> were the strong 
      tonic's that kept energy for the enervating work. Yes I who now am asked 
      to speak of you have only 
      Love to guide me, for in very truth, no more incapable mouse ever [
      <span class="unclear">grieved?</span>]
      
      at the meshes of a lion's net, than I. Yet fresh from new perusal of Leaves of Grass
       
      I felt emboldened—to ask this of you—in hope 
      that thereby. I might undertake the immense responsibility with 
      a certainty of at least one correct representation of your gospel.
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>
      This, &amp; this alone must be my excuse for adding another needless letter to your overburdened
      table.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      But, we who love you over here, &amp; the band is growing and earnest are especially keen
      of late, that no word 
      should reach you, but of estimation &amp; reverence.
