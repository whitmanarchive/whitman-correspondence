   <p>Yours

       with the good 10—God bless you—I half-moped along all through
      February, but am coming round, same as before—I go down three or four days at
      a time to my friends the Staffords, &amp; get out in the woods a great deal—It
      is only half an hour's journey—go again Friday if it 
      dont
      
       storm<sup><a href="#sjs.00016_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Should have come up there with you
      a month ago, but was hardly able—I got a bad chill six weeks ago, struck
      in—(was quite well up to that time)—
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter <em>don't contain</em> the slip about the Emerson business
      you allude to<sup><a href="#sjs.00016_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—The just published Carlyle <em>Reminiscences</em> so well &amp; strongly praised in the <em>Herald</em>, the <em>Critic</em> &amp; every where,
      don't confirm or add to my estimation of C—<em>Much the
         contrary<sup><a href="#sjs.00016_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup></em>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Kennedey comes here quite often &amp; is
      disposed to be friendly—I guess he is a pretty good man, but has <em>the fever called literature</em> &amp; I shouldn't wonder if he
      was in for it, for life<sup><a href="#sjs.00016_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Lathrop<sup><a href="#sjs.00016_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> has visited me—very pleasant—Shall be glad
      to supply you with a set of books of course—I have plenty yet<sup><a href="#sjs.00016_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="sjs.00016_n1">1. Whitman referred to this
      letter in his Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On  Burroughs sent "a little
      remembrance—enough to pay your expenses up here when you get ready to
      come."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00016_n2">2. Whitman again went to
      Glendale on March 18 and remained there four days (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00016_n3">3. Burroughs enclosed, or
      thought he had, a copy of Emerson's "Impressions of Thomas Carlyle in 1848,"
      which was to appear in the May issue of <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em>, 22:89–92.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00016_n4">4. A review of James Anthony
      Froude's volume appeared in <em>The Critic</em> on March 12
      (1:59–60). Of Carlyle, "a towering and god like man," Burroughs wrote
      eulogistically on .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00016_n5">5. Burroughs observed on
      : William Sloane Kennedy "is a good
      fellow but he needs hetcheling to get the toe [sic] out the flax."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00016_n6">6. George Parsons Lathrop
      (1851–1898) was a journalist and the biographer of his father-in-law,
      Nathaniel Hawthorne. Whitman received a letter from Lathrop on March 23 (lost)
      inviting him to come to Boston to give his lecture on Lincoln (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book). According to Kennedy, Lathrop was in Philadelphia on March 8
      in order to arrange for Whitman's lecture (<em>Reminiscences of
         Walt Whitman</em> [London: Alexander Gardner, 1896], 3). Lathrop wrote to
      the poet for the first time on . On
      March 31, 1885, he urged Whitman to give a reading from his own poetry in order
      to raise funds in aid of international copyright laws (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00016_n7">7. According to Clara
      Barrus, Whitman enclosed a proof of "Patroling Barnegat" (<em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
      200).<a href="#r7">[back]
