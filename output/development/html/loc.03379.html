      <br></br><br></br>My dear Master
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter<sup><a href="#loc.03379_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> has made more vivid still the thrills of gratitude your former one gave
      us, and if personal attachment is part of the true poet's need, you assuredly have
      reward. I thank you sincerely for you kindness in forwarding the papers and
      criticisms, they help so much to give us clearer ideas of you and to see our Walt
      from other points of view. How we would have liked to have been present at that
      birthday "party" when Ingersoll (here to all of us once, to some of us still. It
      would do his heart good, much praised as he is &amp; much reviled too at times to
      hear some of his Australian admirers "sticking up" for him, their paladin of
      sham-slayers.) eulogized you as the papers say. We are anxiously watching the papers
      to see the drift of his speech. While out in the cathedral-like gloom of an
      Australian "bush", the sameness of the green of the gum leaves only broken at times
      with the gold of the wattle bloom, the silence only varied by the eloquent warbling
      of our mocking bird (the lyre bird) or the faint, imbodied, tinkle of the shy
      bell-bird, or the screech, as of lost souls, of the white cockatoos, I have often,
      with or without my mates, thought some of Ingersoll's sculptured sentences worthy
      of being uttered in those sacred glades, and if so on other subjects, how much more
      so would we think so when treating of you who have made those great gum trees array
      themselves in such new meanings for us. Our amygdaline (Eucalyptus Amygdalina) once
      was your redwood's rival, now each, towering over its native forest wafts
      comrade-greetings to the other, joining in free-fashion "hands across the sea."
      Those who have felt the awful meaning of our "bush", &amp; our desert with
      its mirages and its rivers swallowed up in sand, and have been self-conscious of
      that "forming, intestinal agitation" in our town-life, have whirred with flywheels,
      and mingled with miners in drives &amp; on mulloch heaps, have been "droving" sheep
      to the Plains of Promise or the weird "Never Never" land, and have wandered from
      station
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>to station with "sundowner" or hawker, have given a hand to the wharf-laborer bumping
      and helped him or resisted him in his "strikes" for justice or his violence (we have
      a great strike on here now, the greatest that has ever taken place here: the whole
      community are involved. In spite of logic and political economy, my whole sympathies
      are with the workmen. It shows what fellowship can do, when it unites the
      "rouseabout" on the Tropic of Capricorn with the "sails" on an Invercargill trader,
      and stimulates the London "docker" to send his subscriptions &amp; his sympathy),
      have been among children at school, among business people and professional, and
      scholars, those who have experienced such, are those who are alone competent <u>here</u>, to pronounce against you, and I have never met one
      such, who has been able to do so: most such, who read at all, find in you their
      natural poet. Jim agrees with me in this, &amp; says furthermore that every action
      he does and every set of circumstances he finds himself in, call up some line of
      yours. Certainly, to me at least, you are a commentary on, and a unifier of the
      disjointed (to me previously) history of the world. I can best illustrate Ada's<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      experience of you by saying that to her you appeared as a vast mist, which however
      gradually developed a nucleus, and that again a nucleolus, which last contained all
      worth containing in the world. Fred's<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r4">4</a></sup> opinion is best symbolised by the rush of the
      iron to the magnet without knowing why, exactly. You would like his way of liking
      you, I think. Eve<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r5">5</a></sup> is an uncompromising evemy of shams, and if I may use the
      expression a slave to Liberty, and as she finds the same in you (as indeed everyone
      finds everything he wants in you), you are her inspired Book. To all of us indeed
      you are our "guide, philosopher &amp; friend." I hope you won't think I am trying to
      flatter, I can't help telling you what we think of you, to anyone else it might be
      flattery, but it is no high-falutin, nothing but the honest downright truth when I
      say that you are the greatest who has ever lived, to us all. The tension of an
      ecstasy, such as a Mohammedan would feel, if privileged to write to &amp; to receive
      letters from his Prophet, is on me while I write and therefore I can't write as I
      would wish to—I can hardly think it is not a dream that I am writing to Walt
      Whitman. Take our love, we have little more to give you, we can only try to spread
      to others the same great book you have given to us.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>We have great difficulty in following the movements of "Your Touchstone,"<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r6">6</a></sup> but I think
      you will see him before he will get your greetings to him here. He was busy with
      John Burns<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r7">7</a></sup> and others in London, the last I heard of him. I am very sorry that Dr.
      Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r8">8</a></sup> book has gone astray: we are prosecuting every enquiry we can in Australia,
      &amp; so I hope we shall get it all right.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>After a long "try," we have managed to get "Leaves of Grass" into our Public Library
      (a magnificent insitution "November Boughs" is already there): this will do it good
      I think for the reviewers &amp; critics (your midwives) will be able to get it, and
      the general reader too.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We will do our best to try &amp; get an order or two for you and think we can do it.
      It seems a pity that you should be getting no benefit of the numerous copies sold
      here.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am trying to get an essay read before the Australian Church Library Society, I
      spoke for you there two or three years ago and managed to rouse a good deal of
      interest at the time in "Leaves of Grass." We are rather a quiet lot and haven't a
      great deal of influence, but as <u>it</u> spreads, you shall
      spread too, I warrant you.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I have a whole lot of questions to ask you about your poems but deem it better not
      to, you must be grown up to and are all the better appreciated when that is the
      case.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We had an important event at our place on the 13th ult.—our first little one.
      We are going to call him Eric Whitman. His mother<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r9">9</a></sup> and he are quite well and she looks
      so happy.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We all send our love and sincerely hope that you are as comfortable as your sad
      misfortunes will allow you. It is so sad to think that your services to human beings
      and to nature should have brought such return from both as yours have. The joy with
      which we receive your letters is flecked with great pangs for your sufferings. And
      you hear it all like the hero you are. Again, with love
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03379_n1">1. The fact that the postmark
      is a week prior to the date of the letter suggests that this might not be the
      right envelope, but there is no other known correspondence from Bernard O'Dowd
      or Australia so near September 2 or 9. This letter is addressed: Walt Whitman |
      328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | United States of America. It is
      postmarked: Melbourne | (?)O | SE 2 | 90; New York | Oct (?) | 2; Camden, N.J. |
      Oct | (?) | 6AM | 1890 | Rec'd. Notes on the address side of the envelope read:
      Sydney &amp; | via San Francisco; 1st Sept: '90.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.03379_n2">2. This letter and the "former
      one" are not extant. The current letter from O'Dowd is the earliest piece of

   <p id="n0119">8. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
