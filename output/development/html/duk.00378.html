      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter come to-day. Every thing with us is pretty much the same. Mother is pretty
      much the same. Some days she [is] better, and some not so well. She has taken a good
      many sulphur vapor baths. She takes one every other day. She goes down in the cars
      to the baths, in Willoughby street near the City Hall.<sup><a href="#duk.00378_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Sometimes Mat goes with her, [and once in] a while she goes [alo]ne. They are rather agreeable to
      take—they make one sweat extremely. Mother goes about the same, around the house.
      She has better use of her arms and wrists than she did there one time—but an hour
      or two, now and then, generally in the morning, she has bad pains. Her appetite is
      pretty good. The weather here lately has been awful—three days the heat was as bad as I ever knew it—so I think that had something to do with mother's feeling weak.
      To-day it is much cooler.
   </p>
   
   <p>Jeff and Martha and Cis<sup><a href="#duk.00378_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> and Eddy are all well. Jess is the same as usual—he works every day in the yard.
      He does not seem to mind the heat. He is employed in the store-house, where they are
      continually busy preparing stores, provisions, to send off in the different vessels.
      He assists in that.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are all very glad the 13th is coming home—mother especially. There have been so
      many accounts of shameful negligence, or worse, in the commissariat of your reg't.
      that there must be <em>something</em> in it—notwithstanding you speak very lightly of the complaints in your letters. The
      <em>Eagle</em>, of course, makes the worst of it, every day, to stop men from enlisting.<sup><a href="#duk.00378_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>All of us here think the rebellion as good as broke—no matter if the war does continue
      for months yet.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00378_n1">1. Part of the upper
      left-hand corner of this letter is missing, and the ink at places is badly
      blurred. It is one of the few letters extant from Walt Whitman to his brother
      while the latter was in the army, although, as the "Check List of Lost Letters"
      indicates, Walt Whitman wrote frequently. For the list of these letters, see
      "Appendix B" in Miller, <em>Correspondence</em>, 1:
      364–370.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00378_n2">2. Henry R. Piercy's sulphur
      baths; see also Whitman's letter from 
      .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00378_n3">3. Walt Whitman probably
      intended to write "Sis," his usual nickname for Jeff's daughter
      Mannahatta.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00378_n4">4. George had enlisted for
      three months in the Thirteenth Regiment on April 19, 1861, six days after the
      firing on Fort Sumter. In the letter from , to which Walt Whitman referred, George, writing to his mother
      from Camp Brooklyn, near Washington, had said: "Well Mother the three Months is
      going fast and I shall soon be with you again. I see some very foolish articles
      in the papers about us sutch as not haveing any thing to eat for 36 hours and
      being almost naked but you must not believe any thing of the kind as we are as
      well off as we could expect."<a href="#r4">[back]
