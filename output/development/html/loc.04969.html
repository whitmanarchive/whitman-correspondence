      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In transmitting to you the last part of the translation, I beg once more leave to
      ask your forbearance. I know very well, that it is to say the least, a weak translation,
      but considering the original I was unable to do it better. I have marked some places
      with ? because the word used does not suit me, but neither in my head nor in my dictionary
      was I able to find any other.
   </p>
   
   <p>Trusting however that this it must be of some use to you,</p>
   
   <p>I remain sir,</p>

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Emil Arctander, who was
      acting vice-consul for Denmark, translated Schmidt's article for Walt Whitman.
      According to his letters of June 17 and 20, 1872, (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.), Arctander did not complete his self-styled "weak translation"
      until later in the month. The translation, with scores of corrections in Walt
      Whitman's hand, is in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.
