      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I can give you no title
      that would not be a mockery. I write this—representing the rising generation to tell
      you that from us you get what you long for Speechless passionate love I seem to see
      now through all dark London young men issuing from houses with "Leaves of Grass" in
      their hands &amp; grandness [
      <span class="unclear">&amp; war?</span>]
       written determinedly on their faces.—I dont know what to say to you—to give
      you any notion of the good you have done me &amp; again I think I speak for hundreds
      of my age <u>21</u>. I have read criticisms reviews of your
      works  &amp; as I
      half expected none of them had the least idea who you were I believe we
      will—perhaps when you have gone from us though I trust not be able to
      vindicate your right to stand alone as the sun of this century &amp; Goethe Kant,
      Spencer Ruskin &amp; the rest of the mighty will have to live as priceless beautiful
      satellites, but yet as satellites. For months I have been bursting with things to
      say to you but now I cannot say a word. In all criticisms upon you the most
      delightful to me is Ruskins. The marvellous clear vision he has is wonderful &amp;
      his honesty is wonderful for the leader—<u>in a minor
         sense</u>—of the opposite school. You dont like being called the leader of a
      school—but you are if your teaching amounted to no more than— "<u>You must find out for yourself</u>"—If I might be
      allowed  to
      criticize, I cant make out, why you have said nothing about children—Is not the
      education of them one of if not the most important thought for the future. I do hope
      you will yet be spared to say something about this or rather to put a tendency
      towards children in your book.—I never read or criticize your Book from the standpoint
      of what the words say, but go to it as I go to the bible in spirit &amp; in truth.—&amp; fish
      out for
      myself tendencies which help in curious unexpected ways. Perhaps the most important
      idea I have got from you in a way I never understood it before is <u>Learn to love</u> I write this chiefly to tell you that the
      new generation admire you in a very different way from the last. What they  may do years
      hence I dont know—I have left to the end to ask you if it is true the awful
      rumours going about that you are starving. The thing is too ghastly to be true—Millions
      &amp; millions of money would never repay the work you have done for us
      &amp; especially for us young men. I am quite poor myself but could I know get money
      for you easily if you are in the least want of it. I think I know you well enough
      to
      know that you will not mind saying you do want some money if you do. I can hardly
      expect an answer to this if you do not,—as you must have all your time occupied but
      if
      you can find time to write a line telling me how you are I shall be very grateful.
