   <p>Dear Evangelist: The inclosed note<sup><a href="#loc.01007_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> may interest you, and therefore I send it. I wrote to Mr. Emerson to get him to interest
      some of his friends (he has several rich ones who give away large sums to various
      good causes) in your Christian Commission Agency. I trust that the result will be
      what I hoped.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Redpath
      (1833–1891) was the author of <em>The Public Life of Capt.
         John Brown</em> (Boston: Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the
      <em>New York Tribune</em> during the war, the originator of
      the "Lyceum" lectures, and editor of the <em>North American
         Review</em> in 1886. He met Whitman in Boston in 1860 (Thomas Biggs Harned
      Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #90) and remained
      an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, ed. Sculley Bradley (New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914),
      3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp."
      See also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins,
      1926).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01007_n2">1. The enclosed note by Emerson reads:
       Concord, 23d February, 1863. My Dear Sir : On my return, a few days since,
      from a long Western journey, I found your note respecting Mr. Whitman. The bad
      feature of the affair to me is that it requires prompt action, which I cannot
      use. I go to-day to Montreal to be gone a week, and I have found quite
      tyrannical necessities at home for my attention. Not to do nothing I have just
      written a note to Mr. F. N. Knapp at Washington, who, I am told, ought to know
      what you tell me, and may know how to employ Mr. Whitman's beneficial agency in
      some official way in the hospitals. As soon as I return home, I shall make
      some trial whether I can find any direct friends and abettors for him and his
      beneficiaries, the soldiers. I hear gladly all that you say of him.
      Respectfully, Mr. Redpath.
       R. W. Emerson.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.01007_n3">2. For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
      John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
      years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an intelligent man who
      deserved something better than the various governmental clerical posts he was to
      hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship, however, was relieved by the
      presence of Whitman whom he was to love and venerate—and defend with a
      single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of vituperation and eulogy that have
      seldom been equaled, most notably in his pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was
      the first, and in many ways the most important, of the adulators who divided
      people arbitrarily into two categories: those who were for and those who were
      against Walt Whitman. The poet praised O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous
      collection of his tales: "He was a born sample here in the 19th century of the
      flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his
      memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton,
      1910] pp. 513). For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>. Of the O'Connors, Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman wrote on : "I am
      real glad, my dear Walt, that you are among such good people. I hope it will be
      in the power of some of our family to return their kindness some day. I'm sure
      twould be done with a heartfelt gratitude. Tis pleasant, too, to think, that
      there are still people of that kind left."<a href="#r2">[back]

      of the owners of Thayer and Eldridge, a Boston publishing firm responsible for
      the third edition of Whitman's <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860).
