   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04016_n1">1. The envelope for this letter
      bears the address: Harry L Stafford | (Glendale) | Kirkwood | Camden County |
      New Jersey. It is postmarked: Camden | Apr | 19 | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04016_n2">2. On this visit Whitman was
      the guest of John L. Wilson, the ship's purser. See also the letter from Whitman
      to Herbert Gilchrist of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04016_n3">3. The artist whom Whitman
      visited frequently. (See <em>Specimen Days</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall
      [New York: New York University Press, 1963], 235). Apparently the Johnstons
      became annoyed at something Whitman said in his (lost) letter to their son on
      June 9, for on  Scovel informed the poet
      that "Johns[t]on called here Sunday with your letter to his Boy." Scovel urged
      Whitman to apologize to the mother and thus "stop Johns[t]on's
      blathering."<a href="#r3">[back]
