      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend Harry Hurt,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I thought I would just drop you a line for yourself—but no doubt you keep 
      fully posted about me by my letters to Pete, as I am willing you or 
      any of my particular friends who wish to, should read them. 
      (He knows who I would be willing should read them—I leave it to him)—Harry, you would
      much enjoy going round N. Y. with me, if it were possible, 
      &amp; then how much I should like having you with me. This great city, 
      with all its crowds, &amp; splendor, &amp; Broadway fashion, &amp; women, &amp; amusements, 
      &amp; the river &amp; bay, &amp; shipping, &amp; the many magnificent new buildings, 
      &amp; Central Park &amp; 5th Avenue, &amp; the endless processions of private vehicles 
      &amp; the finest teams I ever saw, for miles long of a fine afternoon—altogether they
      make up a show that I can richly spend a month in enjoying—for a change from my Washington
      life. I sometimes think I am the particular 
      man who enjoys the show of all these things in N. Y. more than any other mortal—as
      if it was all got up just for me to observe &amp; study. Harry, 
      I wish when you see Ben. Thompson, conductor, you would say I sent 
      him my love, &amp; have not forgot him. Let him read this letter. I send 
      him a newspaper, the N. Y. Clipper. I have marked the piece about the 
      Five Points.<sup><a href="#loc.01587_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> I went down there myself just for fun, three nights ago, 
      with a friend of mine, a policeman, &amp; that account in the Clipper is a very good 
      description—only not half rank enough. I wish you to tell John Towers, conductor,
      
      I sent him my love, &amp; we will see each other again one of these days. I send him 
      a Clipper also with an acc't of the Five Points—Harry, you let one of them 
      lend you the paper, &amp; read the acc't—it will amuse you—I was there two hours—it was
      instructive but disgusting—I saw one of the handsomest white girls 
      there I ever saw, only about 18—blacks &amp; white are all intermingled—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Henry Hurt, like Doyle,
      worked for the Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company. Hurt's reply to this
      letter on , written on the
      company's stationery, had the self-conscious stiltedness of a clerk: "I am
      pleased to Know that you are enjoying your leave of absence so much; may you
      continue to do so until you return. Your favor of 2d inst. to me, and papers for
      others were duly received, and I am requested by the recipients to return their
      thanks for the same." According to the Washington <em>Chronicle</em> of January 15, 1874, at that time he was the treasurer of
      the company.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01587_n1">1. This draft letter is
      endorsed (by R. M. Bucke?), "'68."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.01587_n3">2. The October 3, 1868, issue
      of the <em>Clipper</em> contained Paul Preston's article "On the
      'Five Points,'" part of a series entitled "Reminiscences of a Man about Town."
      Preston recalled the depravities of the inhabitants, the mixture of races, and
      the squalid bars and brothels in this "plague spot," which surrounded the
      intersection of Worth, Park, and Baxter streets in lower Manhattan.<a href="#r2">[back]
