      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours just 
      rec'd
      
       &amp; indeed welcomed—A wretchedly dull forenoon, cold &amp; dark,
      &amp; so slippery, drizzling outside I am prisoned in with glum
      surroundings—to which your cheery note comes like a shaft of sunshine—I
      had not heard from Osgood, &amp; so far the news, as you say, is very
      satisfactory—(Besides I sort 
      o'
      
       think this is all yet only the beginning—the preparatory
      stage)—
   </p>
   
   <p>—No—I had not heard of last Sunday's NY <u>Times</u>—have not seen it—wish you would immediately send me
      one—
   </p>
   
   <p>—I keep well as of late—nothing very new—Love to Alma and Ally
      &amp; all—I hurry to catch the noon mail—
   </p>
