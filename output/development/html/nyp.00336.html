   <p>Friday's letter rec'd—also that of Sunday—also papers—Graphic this morning—I feel pretty fair to-day considering—Keep
      on about same—(cloudy &amp; sunshine)—Rain here too past four days, but I go out—clear
      to-day—I get or see N.Y. and Phil. 
      papers nearly all, &amp; the Wash. Chronicle &amp; the Capital—Write me how new train makes
      out—Do you go through to Balt only—or further? Am glad Buck is your conductor—
   </p>

      This postcard bears the address, "Pete Doyle, | M street South, bet 4½ &amp;
      6th | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Apr | 21 | N.J.; Carrier
      | 22 | Apr (?)| (?)."<br><br>
      The reference to the new express train here and in Whitman's  letter to Doyle permits assignment
      of this postcard to 1874.<a href="#r1">[back]
