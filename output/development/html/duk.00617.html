   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00617_n13">1. Edwin Haviland Miller dated
      this letter March? 1873, but it dates to March 29, 1873, a Saturday at the end
      of a week-long gap since Walt Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:370). Louisa had received newspapers from
      Walt during the most recent week, but she had had no letter since "one wrote
      last friday a week ago yesterday." That extended gap between letters from
      Walt—to be consistent with Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's recent
      death, with Louisa's receipt of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's March 26, 1873
      letter, with George Washington Whitman's efforts to acquire a job as an
      inspector in Brooklyn and his progress on the new house at 431 Stevens Street,
      and with Helen Price's March 27, 1873 letter on Paulina Wright Davis—can
      only fall between her receipt of Walt's  and his 
      letters.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00615_n6">3. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00617_n11">4. See Helen Price's March 27,
      1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Trent Collection, Duke University).
      During the 1860s, Abby Price and her family, especially her daughter Helen, were
      friends with Walt Whitman and his mother, and the Price family began to save
      Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman were included in Richard
      Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia:
      David McKay, 1883), and she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters
      to her mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00617_n15">5. Paulina Wright Davis
      (1813–1876) was a noted feminist who presided over the first National
      Woman's Rights Convention. See Sherry L. Ceniza, <em>Walt Whitman
         and 19th-Century Women Reformers</em> (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama
      Press, 1998), 96–139. Wright Davis and her husband Thomas Davis
      (1806–1895), a jewelry manufacturer, resided in Providence, Rhode Island,
      and Walt Whitman had visited them during his October 1868 vacation. Helen Price
      reported that Paulina "is expected home in May" (see her March 27, 1873 letter
      to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman [Trent Collection, Duke University]).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00617_n16">6. Katy Hinds, the niece of
      Paulina Wright Davis and Thomas Davis, was also close to Abby Price. See Sherry
      L. Ceniza, <em>Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers</em>
      (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1998), 94.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00617_n7">7. Josephine Barkeloo, daughter
      of Tunis S. Barkeloo, was a Brooklyn friend of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, and
      Josephine sailed to Belgium in winter 1872 on the <em>Queen</em>,
      a ship owned by the National Steam Navigation Company. For Josephine's impending
      departure and her hope to "perfect myself in the French and German languages,"
      see her  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman (Library of Congress). With her  letter to Walt, Louisa forwarded Josephine's letter from
      Belgium.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00617_n3">8. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. He married Louisa Orr Haslam in
      spring 1871, and they moved to 722 Stevens Street in Camden. At the time of this
      letter, George was already or would soon be inspecting pipe for Moses Lane at
      the R. D. Wood Foundry sites in Camden and Florence, New Jersey, and at the
      Gloucester Iron-Works (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00617_n5">9. This Adams is not Julius W.
      Adams, the noted Brooklyn engineer, but a Brooklyn City Works Commissioner named
      Henry Adams, who is listed in a public call to property owners on the altering
      of water lines on Lee Avenue ("Notice," <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Eagle</em>, December 5, 1872, 1). See Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman, in which
      an Adams, the same man, is described as a commissioner.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n4">10. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00617_n4">11. See Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman's March 26, 1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Dennis Berthold
      and Kenneth Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of
         Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em>, [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press,
      1984], 164–165).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00616_n4">12. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman (1836–1873) died on February 19, 1873 from complications
      associated with a throat ailment that had first been noted by her husband Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in February 1863. Mattie and Jeff had two daughters,
      Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St.
      Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
      emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26. Waldron reports that a physician identified the cause
      of death as cancer (3). Robert Roper has speculated that Mattie's accompanying
      bronchial symptoms may have been associated with tuberculosis (<em>Now the Drum of War</em> [New York: Walker, 2008], 78–79).<a href="#r12">[back]

      was building a house on a corner lot at 431 Stevens Street in Camden, New Jersey
      (see Jerome M. Loving, ed. "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
