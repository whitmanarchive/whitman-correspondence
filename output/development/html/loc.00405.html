      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I mailed a letter to you yesterday promising to write you again to-day. Ruggles<sup><a href="#loc.00405_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> came up and saw Andrew last eve. and had quite a lengthy interview &nbsp;He said that
      the stuff that he was taking was abt as good for him as he could take and to continue but that the thing that would cure
      him would to be very careful of himself and to breathe nothing but the best and freshest
      air. Drink none, stay at home nights sleep in a well-ventilated room &amp;c &amp;c and be
      careful to work out-doors &nbsp;I walked down with him (Ruggles) afterward and he told
      me that it was a pretty bad case, that he couldnt take anything that would help him particularly. That the trouble was very low down in his throat and
      that such cases often ended in consumption. He said that the best thing that he could
      do would be to get work away from the sea-coast if possible. I hope Andrew will take
      better care of himself in future. The Dr. will see him again in 6 or 8 days
   </p>
   
   <p>The enclosed $5.0 Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00405_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> sends <em>you</em> &nbsp;He wished me to say that he would write you himself but could hardly get time. He
      told me to tell you that he intended the money for your own especial benefit &nbsp;That
      you could not stay there without its costing you something and that you could do this
      amt of good to the soldiers by telling them good, cheerful things and letting them
      look at you.<sup><a href="#loc.00405_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> The amt of it is I suppose he thinks that as you are giving all your time to the Hospitals that you must want a little money yourself. It is certainly characteristic
      of the man. I told him I would take it and send it to you and tell you what he said
      but that you would probably apply it as you had the rest. Anyway you must write him
      abt it. He told me that the man Crany<sup><a href="#loc.00405_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> would send you some more too, or had promised to. I wish you would write Mr Lane.<sup><a href="#loc.00405_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother had a letter from Heyde to-day. He says that Han is not any different. The
      whole of his letter is taken up with abuse of George for not coming on when he had
      his furlough. And after a long rigarmarole he winds up with saying that he has no accomodations for anyone. Nice pup aint he. Oh I wish to God he had been in Hell before we ever saw him.<sup><a href="#loc.00405_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Poor Han I hope she will get able to come home. Han had received your letter telling her that George had been home. Mother
      wrote Han that George was home and that he would come and see her but that his furlough
      was so short that twould be impossible and received a reply from Heyde that he would not give the letter to
      her for he was afraid it would excite her too much. We supposed of course, however
      that she knew that he had been home, but it seems that she did not know it till she
      received your letter. Mother has written her to-day and I send one of his little pictures.
   </p>
   
   <p>I believe that Hattie has received no injury from her fall &nbsp;she appears to-day abt the same as usual. She is growing finely and is as smart as a child of her age ought
      to be. All the rest the same as usual &nbsp;I am going to try to get Mat to go to the Opera
      to-morrow to the P. M. performance &nbsp;I want her to hear this company before they leave.<sup><a href="#loc.00405_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> I spoke yesterday abt Public doc. I of course mean scientific ones &nbsp;those I should be glad to get.<sup><a href="#loc.00405_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Write me as much and as often as you can &nbsp;What do you think abt George, &amp; where is he?</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00405_n1">1. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Jeff and Mattie Whitman. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest
      in his practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles
      Gems" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:90, n. 85).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00405_n2">2. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00405_n3">3. Walt Whitman often
      prepared "from a couple to four or five hours" for a hospital visit in order to
      exude "the perfection of phsyical health" and to present "as cheerful an
      appearance as possible" (Floyd Stovall, ed., <em>Walt Whitman:
         Prose Works 1892</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1963–64],
      1:52). He wrote in a letter dated ,
      "my profoundest help to these sick &amp; dying men is probably the soothing
      invigoration I steadily bear in mind, to infuse in them through affection,
      cheering love… It has saved more than one
      life."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00405_n4">4. Unidentified.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.00405_n5">5. There is no record of
      Walt Whitman writing Lane at this time.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00405_n6">6. Walt Whitman referred
      to Charles Heyde with similar exasperation, calling him "the bed-buggiest man on
      the earth"—"almost the only man alive who can make me mad" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden (November 1, 1888–January
         20, 1889)</em> [New York: Rowman and Littlefield, 1961], 3:498).<a href="#r6">[back]

      troupe gave a matinee performance of Donizetti's <em>Linda di
         Chamounix</em> at the New York Academy of Music on April 4, 1863. See also
