      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of the 4th I
      received this morning. The number of Harper's magazine and of
      the New York Tribune did <u>not</u> follow, but most probably
      they will reach me; printed matter is very often going an other way. If your "Prayer
      of Columbus" be not too long, I shall try to get a translation of it published in
      one of our papers.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Immediately after my return from Germany (28th February) I did write to
      you and sent you a long article of your book in the paper "Fædrelandet"
      (fatherland); the last monday I mailed for you another article in the weekly paper
      "Naer og Fjern" (Near and Far). All these things have been sent to New Jersey. To the Treasury in Washington have been sent in all <u>three</u> copies
      of "Demokratiske Fremblik", one in loose sheets ([
      <span class="unclear">franked</span>]
      ), one complete paper bound copy
      [
      <span class="unclear">franked</span>]
       and
      one other (for greater safety, as unpaid letters and papers never fail their
      [
      <span class="unclear">man?</span>]
      ). Some copies of
      "[
      <span class="unclear">Illustreret?</span>]
      
      Fædrelandet" (peoples illustrated magazine) with  your portrait and some short
      biographical notices have also been sent to Washington.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>With Clausen I sent you in the [
      <span class="unclear">autumn 1872</span>]
       a large portrait of mine,
      the only resembling one, that ever has been taken. Write to Mrs Clausen, if they
      have not forwarded it to you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If you could, without troubling yourself too much, send me <u>all</u> the pieces of Clemens Petersen, that come
      to your eye-sight, I should be very glad. This singular man has a great charm to me,
      though I never liked him.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If my thoughts did not weaken and wither, when I try to give them expression in the
      English language, I should on some sheets give you a due description of our
      political and literary doings. Although the word of Hamlet: there is something
      rotten in the state of Denmark, still are true, I have the greatest belief of the
      vitality of my people and [
      <span class="unclear">the?</span>]
       other Scandinavian peoples. We have been living here in the
      outskirts of civilization; we have been endowed with its gifts, but we 
      have have
      
       not been poisoned with its venom. Ours is the future in Europe, small as
      we are.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In no European country, and most probably also not in America, your personality, your mode of  viewing the things shall be more sure to
      [
      <span class="unclear">touch?</span>]
       the chord of
      the native mind as here and in Norway. We are made of the
      true democratic stuff, we have not the venomous passions, but we have the high ideal
      aspiration. A peasant on [
      <span class="unclear">Fijen</span>]
       (one of our fertile isles) wrote to me in the spring for two
      years ago to thank me for my article on you. Peasants are on the [
      <span class="unclear">sundays holding</span>]
       the
      numbers of "for [illegible], in their [
      <span class="unclear">hard fists</span>]
       and read every word, though the matters often
      are very difficult.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But on the <u>political</u> arena our democratic leaders are dull
      and narrowminded persons, to say nothing worse. None of them has named your book
      yet, most probably they won't name it at all. It is your (political) adversaries,
      who wrote criticisms on you. But your adversaries are mostly your friends, they have
      themselves a democratic mind and grant you much more than the editors of the
      American magazines. But your best friends are the women. A young Baroness [
      <span class="unclear">Fraupe?</span>]
       has read your books
      with true enthusiasm. The women have understood, that the ordinary criticisms can
      as
      easily be applied on a [
      <span class="unclear">nature?</span>]
       like yours as the process of hair cutting and shaving on a
      mountain forest.  "It
      is nearly comical", writes a young [
      <span class="unclear">married?</span>]
       lady to
      me, "to see the critics cut and [
      <span class="unclear">crop?</span>]
       the [
      <span class="unclear">broad?</span>]
       American till they have given him their own small figure."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your early female friend Mrs [
      <span class="unclear">Rorle</span>]
       lies [
      <span class="unclear">deathly?</span>]
       over in Rome—poor thing.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Professor Rasmus Nielson has read your book with the greatest satisfaction. He is
      the
      only man, who could give a true criticism on it, but he is an old man and not very
      willing to write in the papers.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Hoping a speedy amelioration of your health I remain</p>
