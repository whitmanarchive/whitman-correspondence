      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I got a letter from Jeff last Sunday—he says you have a very bad cold indeed—dear
      mother, I feel much concerned about it—I do hope it has passed over before this—Jeff
      wrote me about the house, I hope it will be so you can both remain in the same house,<sup><a href="#loc.00812_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> it would be much more satisfaction [illegible] very sick of brain fever, I was with—the poor boy is dead,<sup><a href="#loc.00812_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> he was only 19, &amp; a noble boy, so good, though out of his senses some eight days,
      though still having a kind of idea of things, no relative or friend was with him,
      it was very sad, I was with him considerable, only just sitting by him soothing him,
      he was wandering all the time, his talk was so affecting it kept the tears in my eyes
      much of the time, the last 24 hours he sunk very rapidly—he had been sick some months
      ago, &amp; was put in the 6th invalid corps—they ought to have sent him home instead—the next morn'g after his death his brother came, a very fine man, postmaster at Lyme
      Ridge, Pa.—he was much affected, &amp; well he might be.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I think it is worse than ever here in the hospitals, we are getting the dregs
      as it were of the sickness &amp; awful hardships of the past three years—there is the
      most horrible cases of diarrhea you ever conceived of, &amp; by the hundreds &amp; thousands,
      I suppose from such diet as they have in the army—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, dear mother, I will not write any more on the sick—&amp; yet I know you wish to
      hear about them—every one is so unfeeling, it has got to be an old story—there is
      no good nursing—O I wish you were—or rather women of such qualities as you &amp; Mat—were
      here, in plenty, to be stationed as matrons among the poor sick &amp; wounded men—just
      to be present would be enough—O what good it would do them—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I feel so sick when I see what kind of people there are among them, with charge
      over them, so cold &amp; ceremonious, afraid to touch them—Well, Mother, I fear I have
      written you a flighty kind of a letter—I write in haste—
   </p>
