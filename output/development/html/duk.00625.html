   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00625_n2">1. This letter dates to between
      April 10 and April 15, 1873. Richard Maurice Bucke dated this letter April 12,
      1873, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:213, n. 63; 370). The letter may date April 12, but the date
      can only be established to within a range of a few days. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's letter instructs Walt Whitman that he need not direct letters to
      George Washington Whitman's office. Walt in his next letter asked, almost
      certainly in response to this request, whether the new address that he used was
      correct (see his  letter to Louisa).
      Walt's letter does not establish April 12 as the definite date for this letter,
      but a few days before April 16, 1873 is consistent with Louisa's earlier report
      that George's wife Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, who was believed pregnant, had not
      come down the stairs for several days. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote in her
       letter to Walt that "she dident
      come down stairs all day monday)." Louisa wrote in this letter that her
      daughter-in-law has not come down stairs "since last tuesday." The two letters,
      taken together, place Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman upstairs without coming down
      from Monday or Tuesday (April 7 or 8) through the date of this letter. The range
      of dates for this letter is thus no earlier than April 10 and no later than
      April 15. Bucke's date April 12 falls near the midpoint of the range and may be
      derived from an envelope or other external marking, so it has the highest
      probability among the range of dates.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00625_n7">2. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. His brother George Washington Whitman cared for him for
      most of the rest of his life, with financial support from Walt Whitman. Walt
      reported he would soon send a monthly payment of $20 in his  letter.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00625_n8">3. Walt Whitman's most recent
      extant letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman was that of , so it is probable that two letters from Walt
      to his mother, April 11, 1873, and another, are not extant (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:212; 363).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00625_n3">4. Walt Whitman had
      previously addressed his letters to George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) at Star's Foundry (Walt wrote "Starr's") in Camden, New
      Jersey (see his  letter to
      Manahatta Whitman).<br><br>
      George was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman,
      Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union Army
      in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information
      on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00578_n1">5. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to May 1, 1869.
      The connection between Lane and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, who had served
      under Lane before accepting the position of Chief Engineer at the St. Louis
      Water Works, led to George Washington Whitman's employment as a pipe inspector
      in Brooklyn. Lane later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and
      served there as city engineer.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00625_n14">6. George Washington Whitman
      in early 1873 was employed at Star's Foundry in Camden, New Jersey, but he was
      probably inspecting pipe for Moses Lane, chief engineer of the Milwaukee Water
      Works (see note above), at the R. D. Wood Foundry sites in Camden and Florence,
      New Jersey. The Gloucester Iron-Works was an enterprise founded by directors
      formerly associated with Star's Foundry in 1864, and it specialized in casting
      pipes for water and gas distribution (see the Historical Society of
      Pennsylvania's finding aid to the R. D. Wood &amp; Co. Records, 1858–1910,
      http://hsp.org/sites/default/files/legacy_files/migrated/findingaid1176wood.pdf;
      and see George Reeser Prowell, <em>The History of Camden County,
         New Jersey</em> [Philadelphia: Richards, 1886], 594).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n6">7. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00625_n15">8. The "aunt Lib" or "aunt
      Libby" who was engaged to assist Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman has not been
      identified but was probably named Elizabeth. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman described
      her daughter-in-law Louisa Orr's aunt as English, and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      was not fond of the aunt's company: "i wouldent be very sorry if aunty wasent
      here" (see her  letter
      to Walt Whitman). The aunt is designated "aunt Libby" in Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's  letter to Walt.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00625_n13">9. Approximately a week
      earlier Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote that George Washington Whitman's wife
      Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman was "in the family way they think so still" and that
      "they wont let her hardly move yesterday she dident come down stairs all day
      monday)" (see Louisa's  letter to
      Walt Whitman).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00625_n4">10. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had
      shared a home with Jeff and his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman for
      several years before their departure to St. Louis. The death of Mattie on
      February 19, 1873 was a devastating emotional blow to Louisa (see Jeff's
      February 24, 1873 letter to Louisa in Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed.,
      <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson
         Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984], 158; and see
      Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00625_n11">11. George Washington Whitman
      was building a larger house on a corner lot at 431 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey (see Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975], 31). For an extended description of George's planned house, see Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt
