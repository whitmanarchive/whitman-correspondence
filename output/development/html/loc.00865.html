      Walt Whitman—
      
      <br></br><br></br>My dear sir—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I went to the hospital in Pemberton Square yesterday and saw your friend Babbitt.<sup><a href="#loc.00865_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>  I found him in a bad way.  For two months, he tells me, he has been unable to do
      any thing for himself on account of giddiness if he attempts to rise.  He therefore
      is confined to one position—poor fellow!—flat on his back, but is cheerful nevertheless,
      and on hearing your name he brightened up and gave me a warm welcome.  He was in Barre some time after his return from under your care, and among his friends he grew
      better—was able to go about; but the ride—some sixty miles, I think—so unsettled his
      nervous organization that for three weeks it seemed to him that he was still on the
      cars.  He has not sat up since.  He was very grateful for your interest, and his last
      words to me were—"tell him to write to me."  He cannot speak a loud word owing to his diseased throat.  He looks pretty well, however, and
      his hand was strong and honest when I shook it at parting.  His case I think a very
      painful one—how much harder than though he had gone into the battle and lost his life
      or a limb!  There seems a sort of hopelessness about this, and being unused to hospitals
      my feelings were far from cheerful, though I tried to say brave and encouraging things to him and uttered the customary platitudes—the "Be thou clothed"
      and "Be thou fed" formulas,—without giving a rag or a crumb else.  I asked if I could
      do anything for him.  He told me no, thanking me.  His thought seemed most on getting
      a letter from you.
   </p>
   
   <p>If you are in the Armory Hospital and inquire for Frank McDonald, Ward E., I believe
      you may say a kind word to a friend of mine.
   </p>
   
   <p>Hoping what I have written may interest you, I remain with much regard</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Benjamin Penhallow
      Shillaber (1814–1890) was a celebrated humorist and newspaperman. While he
      was with the <em>Boston Post</em>, he invented the American
      version of Mrs. Malaprop, and <em>The Life and Sayings of Mrs.
         Partington</em> (New York: J.C. Derby, 1854) was a best-seller. John
      Townsend Trowbridge was associated with Shillaber in the short-lived comic
      journal <em>Carpet Bag</em>, in which appeared the first writings
      of Artemus Ward and Mark Twain. Shillaber wrote to Whitman about Babbitt on
      December 14, 1863 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (New York: Rowman and
      Littlefield, 1961), 2:96–97). See Trowbridge, <em>My Own
         Story, with recollections of noted persons</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1903), 179–182; and Cyril Clemens, "Benjamin Shillaber and His 'Carpet
      Bag,' " <em>New England Quarterly</em>, 14 (1941):
      519–537.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00865_n2">1. As Whitman informed Mrs.
      Curtis in a , Caleb Babbitt
      suffered a sun stroke in July and was admitted to Armory Square Hospital.
      According to the "Hospital Note Book" (Henry E. Huntington Library), Babbitt had
      been in Mobile, Alabama, earlier. About August 1, 1863, he left Washington on
      furlough. On , Caleb's sister, Mary
      A. Babbitt informed Whitman of Caleb's arrival in Barre, Massachusetts; because
      of his exhaustion he was unable to write. On , at the expiration of his forty-day furlough, Caleb was
      strong enough to write: "Walt—In your letters you wish me to imagine you talking
      with me when I read them, well I do, and it does very well to think about, but
      it is nothing compared with the original." On , Babbitt was depressed—"dark clouds seem to be lying in my
      pathway and I can not remove them nor hide them from my mind"—until he mentioned
      his beloved, Nellie F. Clark, who "has saved me." On , S. H. Childs wrote for Caleb from the Massachusetts
      General Hospital, Boston: "He Is unable to set up &amp; suffers considerable
      pain In his
      head."
