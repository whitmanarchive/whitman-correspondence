      <br></br><br></br>Dear sister
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have had a wonderful fine day—I feel much better—had the best night's sleep last
      night for four weeks—Miss Hillard<sup><a href="#uva.00377_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> came at 10 this forenoon, &amp; took me over in the coupé to Philadelphia—went &amp; saw
      the great Dr Mitchell,<sup><a href="#uva.00377_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I was very well pleas'd with him—I am to go again—He did not express any opinion
      particular—said he would tell me next time—examined my heart by auscultation—said
      there was nothing at all the matter with <em>that</em>—Then I went to Mrs Perot's<sup><a href="#uva.00377_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; we had dinner—Mrs P brought me home in the coupé—had a very good 4 or 5 hours—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Harry is up spending the afternoon with me—brought a chicken—your card to Bell<sup><a href="#uva.00377_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; letter to George came this forenoon—George has not yet got home—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Lou, my old grand-aunt 97 years old in New York, Mrs Sarah Mead,<sup><a href="#uva.00377_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> died last Tuesday—I got a letter from her son-in-law Thursday—will finish this, &amp;
      send it off to-morrow—Sunday—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p><em>Sunday afternoon—3–4 oclock—</em></p>  
   
   
   <p>George got home about dark last evening, &amp; is away up to the farm to-day—he seems
      all right as usual—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Bell has been to church this morning—She continues to get along excellently well—We
      have quite a good many callers<sup><a href="#uva.00377_n10" id="r8">8</a></sup>—I am not so well to-day—my rheumatism makes itself felt nearly all the time, yet
      not so severe—Fine sunny weather yet—
   </p>

      <br></br>Brother Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>5:30—Have been out for over half an hour's walk (I &amp; Tip<sup><a href="#uva.00377_n8" id="r9">9</a></sup>) up to Broadway—pleasant warm evening—met Mr Elverson<sup><a href="#uva.00377_n9" id="r10">10</a></sup> &amp; Alise, (I think she looks &amp; behaves finer than ever)—George not home yet from the
      farm—I smell Bell's <em>strong tea</em> cooking on the stove, for supper—I will now go out to post office &amp; mail this—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00377_n1">1. The envelope for this letter
      bears the address: Mrs Louisa O Whitman | Care of F E Dowe | Norwich | Conn:. It
      is postmarked: Camden | AP(?) | 14 | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00377_n2">2. According to the letter
      from Whitman to Emma Dowe of , Louisa
      left for Norwich, Connecticut, to see her sister on April 10 and returned on
      April 20 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00377_n3">3. As evidenced in his letter
      to Charles W. Eldridge of , Whitman
      had known Kate Hillard's writings since 1871. He sent her a copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> on July 27 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00377_n4">4. Dr. S. Weir Mitchell
      (1829–1914) was a specialist in nervous disorders as well as a poet and a
      novelist. On April 18, Whitman had his second interview with Dr. Mitchell, who
      attributed his earlier paralysis to a small rupture of a blood vessel in the
      brain but termed Whitman's heart "normal and healthy." Whitman also noted that
      "the <em>bad spells</em> [Mitchell] tho't recurrences by <em>habit</em> (? sort of automatic)" (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Mitchell was the first physician to
      indicate the psychosomatic nature of many of Whitman's ailments. Probably the
      impending lecture on the death of Lincoln unconsciously brought back the
      emotional involvements of his hospital experiences with comrades whom he had
      come to love only to be separated from them.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00377_n5">5. Mrs. Elliston L. Perot,
      evidently a friend of Kate Hillard, called on the poet on April 3, according to
      Whitman's notation on her calling card mounted in his Commonplace Book.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00377_n6">6. Louisa's servant.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00377_n7">7. Whitman noted on February
      25, 1878 in his Commonplace Book that he had been reading a letter about his
      aunt in the New York <em>Evening Post</em> of February 22. The
      article in the newspaper mentioned that Mrs. Sarah Mead had seen George
      Washington (The Trent Collection of Walt Whitman Manuscripts, Duke University
      Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). From a member of Mrs.
      Mead's family or from a friend Whitman received a letter on  announcing her death.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00377_n10">8. In addition to Harry
      Stafford, Debbie Stafford and her future husband, Joseph Browning, called on
      April 10 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00377_n8">9. Whitman's dog.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00377_n9">10. Probably Joseph Elverson,
      Jr., assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Night</em>.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
