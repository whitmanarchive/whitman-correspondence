      relishes her food, and consumes as much as she used when well: Yet she has very
      bad spells, which
      she rather encourages: This however is constitutional, and for which, her good

      woman.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a French-born
      landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman (1823–1890), Walt
      Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_96.html">Heyde, Charles Louis (1822–1892)</a>," <em>Walt
