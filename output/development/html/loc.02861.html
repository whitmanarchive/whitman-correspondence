      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was to tell you about my acquaintanceship with Tennyson, which was a
      pleasant episode in my life at Haslemere. Hearing of the extreme beauty of the
      scenery thereabouts &amp; specially of its comparative wildness &amp; seclusion, he
      thought he would like to find or build a house, to escape from the obtrusive
      curiosity of the multitudes who flock to the Isle of Wight at certain  seasons of the
      year—He is even morbidly sensitive on this point &amp; will not stir beyond
      his own grounds from 
      weeks
      
       end to 
      weeks
      
       end to avoid his admiring or inquisitive persecutors—So, knowing an
      old friend of mine, he called on me for particulars as to the resources of the
      neighbourhood. And I, good walker &amp; familiar with every least frequented spot of
      hill &amp; dale for some miles round, took him long rambles
      in quest of a site. Very pleasant rambles they were;
      Tennsyon, under the influence of the fresh, outdoor, quite unconstrained life in new
       scenery &amp; with
      a cheerful aim, shaking off the languid ennuyé air, as of a man to whom nothing
      has any longer a relish—bodily or mental that too often hangs about him. And
      we found something quite to his mind—a coppice of 40 acres hanging on the
      south side two thirds of the way up a hill some 1000 ft high, so as to be sheltered
      from the cold &amp; yet have the light, dry, elastic hill air—&amp; with, of
      course, a glorious outlook  over the wooded weald of Sussex so richly green &amp; fertile
      &amp; looking almost as boundless as the great sweep of sky over it—the South
      Downs— the Surrey Hills &amp; near at hand the hill curving round a
      fir-covered promontory, standing out very black &amp; grand between him &amp; the
      Sun set. Underfoot too a wilderness of beauty—fox gloves (I wonder if they
      grow in America) ferns, purple heath &amp;c &amp;c.—I don't suppose I shall
      see much more of him now I have left Haslemere;  though I have had very friendly
      invitations; for I am a home bird—don't like staying out—wanted at home
      and happiest there. And I should not enjoy being with them in the grand mansion half
      so much as I did pic-nicing in the road &amp; watching the builders as we did. It is
      pleasant to see T. with children—little girls at least—he does not take
      to boys, but one of my girls was mostly on his knee when they were in the room &amp;
      he liked them very much. His two Sons are now both 6 ft. high.—I have received
      your letters of March 20 from Brooklyn: but the one you speak of as having
      acknowledged the photograph never came  to hand—a sore disappointment to
      me, dear Friend. I can ill afford to lose the long &amp; eagerly watched for
      pleasure of a letter. If it seems to you there must needs be something unreal,
      illusive in a love that has grown up entirely without the basis of personal
      intercourse, dear Friend, then you do not yourself realize your own power nor
      understand the full meaning of your own words,—"whoso touches this, touches
       a man"—"I
      have put my Soul &amp; Body into these Poems." Real effects imply real causes. Do
      you suppose that an ideal figure conjured up by her own fancy could, in a perfectly
      sound healthy woman of my age, so happy in her children, so busy &amp; content,
      practical earnest, produce such real &amp; tremendous effect—saturating her
      whole life, colouring every waking moment—filling her with such joys such
      pains that the strain of them has been well nigh  too much even for a strong frame, coming
      as it does, after twenty years of hard work? 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Therefore please dear Friend, do not "warn" me any more—it hurts so, as seeming
      to distrust my love—Time only can show how needlessly. My love, flowing ever
      fresh &amp; fresh out of my heart, will go with you in all your wanderings, dear
      Friend, enfolding you day and night soul &amp; body, with tenderness that tries so
      vainly to utter itself in these poor, helpless words, that clings closer than any
      man's love can cling. O, I could not live if I did not believe that sooner or later
      you will not be able to help stretching out your arms towards me &amp; saying "Come,
      my Darling."—When you get this will you post me an American Newspaper  (any one you have done
      with) as a token it has reached you—&amp; so on at intervals during your
      wanderings; it will serve as a token that you are well, &amp; the postmark will tell
      me where you are. And thus you will feel free only to write when you have leisure
      &amp; inclination—&amp; I shall be spared that feeling  I have when I fancy my letters have not
      [
      <span class="unclear">reached you—as
         if I were so</span>]
       hopelessly, helplessly cut off from you which is more
      than I can stand. We all read American news eagerly too.—The children are so
      well &amp; working on with all their might. The school turns [
      <span class="unclear">but?</span>]
       more what I desired for them than I had
      ventured to hope.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
