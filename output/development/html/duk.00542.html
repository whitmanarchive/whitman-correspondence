   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00542_n16">1. This letter dates to April
      7, 1868. The date "april 7" appears in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and
      Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to 1868; Edwin Haviland Miller agreed
      with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:365). The year is correct, as
      the letter refers to a speech by Benjamin F. Butler during negotiations on the
      impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, which was printed in newspapers
      on March 30, 1868.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00542_n2">3. Van Brunt Bergen
      (1841–1917) was an employee of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1864 to 1895.
      The son of Congressman Tunis G. Bergen, Van Brunt Bergen (1841–1917)
      graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1863 with a degree in civil
      engineering. He wrote a short history of the department, which was printed in
      Henry R. Stiles, ed., <em>The Civil, Political, Professional, and
         Ecclesiastical History . . . of the County of Kings and the City of
         Brooklyn, New York from 1683 to 1884</em> (New York: W. W. Munsell, 1884),
      584–594. See also Thomas Jefferson Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00542_n13">4. Edwin Haviland Miller dated
      the two missing Walt Whitman letters April 2 and April 6, 1868 (Walt Whitman,

   <p id="duk.00542_n3">5. Nicholas Amerman had a
      grocery store on Myrtle Avenue. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had requested 10
      dollars to settle a similar debt in her  letter to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00542_n8">6. Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975), 10–11. For Mary's recent visit to her mother, see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="duk.00542_n4">7. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Walter Whitman, Sr., and
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. She resided in Burlington, Vermont, with her husband
      Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. The relationship
      between Hannah and Charles was difficult and marred with quarrels and disease.
      Charles was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor
      treatment of Hannah. Louisa reported a letter from Charles, but not Hannah, in
      her  letter to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00542_n5">8. Benjamin F. Butler
      (1818–1893) was a Union general in the Civil War and a leader among
      Radical Republicans who pushed for the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson.
      During the war, Butler was credited with labeling escaped fugitive slaves as
      "contraband of war," and his soldiers occupied New Orleans. As a member of the
      House of Representatives, he served as a prosecutor during the impeachment
      proceeding in the Senate. For the request by Johnson's counsel that the trial be
      postponed for 30 days (or 10 days), a request that was rejected, see "News of
      the Day: Congress," <em>New York Times</em>, March 24, 1868, 1.
      Also see "Gen. Butler's Opening Speech for the Prosecution," <em>New York Times</em>, March 31, 1868, 1. On Butler's cleverness, Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman may refer to a letter from Butler to the Salem (Massachusetts)
      <em>Gazette</em>, which was reprinted as "Gen. Butler on
      Impeachment—The Financial Policy and His Own Sagacity," <em>New York Times</em>, March 26, 1868, 1.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00575_n9">9. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
      adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
      he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
      St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Jeff
      Whitman. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta "Hattie"
      (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" (b. 1863). In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to join Jeff after he had assumed the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in 1867. For more on Mattie, see
      the introduction to Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r9">[back]
