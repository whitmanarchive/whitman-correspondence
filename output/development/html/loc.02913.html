   <p>Yours of yesterday 
      rec'd—I could send the MS of <u>Carlyle from
         an American Point of View</u> by the 20th or 21st a week from now<sup><a href="#prc.00077_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—It would make about nine or ten pages—
   </p>
   
   <p>—What I
      said about its being "a candidate for the place of leading paper" &amp;c—was meant
      to be left entirely to the editorial exigencies &amp; judgment—no <u>condition</u> at all—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00077_n1">1. Whitman sent the article
      on May 18, and it was returned to him (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). It is printed in <em>Specimen
         Days</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall (New York: New York University Press, 1963),
      254–262. <em>The North American Review</em> also rejected
      "The Prairies in Poetry" which the poet submitted on May 4 and for which he
      asked $50 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). This article included a number of
      sections in <em>Specimen Days</em> (219–224; and see
      Stovall's note, 219n).<a href="#r1">[back]
