   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00121_n3">1. Boston friends were
      raising money to buy a summer cottage they hoped would improve Whitman's failing
      health. Whitman eventually used the money to build his extravagant mausoleum in
      Harleigh Cemetery—to the shock and dismay of those who had worked hardest
      to solicit money.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="bpl.00019_n1">2. Apparently Dr. William P.
      Wesselhoeft contributed $50 to the fund, since Baxter enclosed Wesselhoeft's
      check for that sum in his letter to Whitman of .<a href="#r2">[back]
