      <br></br><br></br>Mr. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been very much interested in your hospital work, of which I have heard through
      my brother, Dr. Russell of Boston. I inclose seventy–five dollars, which I have collected
      among a few friends in Salem, and which I hope may be of some little service to our
      brave boys, who surely should not suffer while we have the power to help them. You
      have our warmest sympathy in your generous work, and though sad to witness so much
      suffering, it is indeed a privilege to be able to do something to alleviate it.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope to be able to send you an addition to this contribution, and thought of waiting
      for a larger sum, but I see that you are having numbers of sick sent in to Washington
      daily, so you will be in immediate want of money.
   </p>

      Very Gratefully Your Friend,
      <br></br>Mrs. George W. Briggs, April 21. Salem, Mass.
