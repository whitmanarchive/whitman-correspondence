      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Brother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish I had written to you before, but first I could not, I wanted 
      too
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Now I feel anxious to write. I am 
      gratefull
      
       for your being so thoughtful and unselfish in your own great grief, to
      write to me, I don't know what I should have done without,—your letters done
      me good.
   </p>
   
   <p>I want to ask you dear brother to try to not grieve. I do wish you would try to not,
      when dear mother was here she said that sometimes  she felt bad to think we all thought so
      much of her, for at most she could not be with us a great while.
   </p>
   
   <p>We all seem, [
      <span class="unclear">oddly?</span>]
       and
      all, to depend upon you so much, and next to dear mother you are the very nearest
      to
      me.—
   </p>
   
   <p>I know that just as long as you love you will miss dear Mother; and so shall I,</p>
   
   <p>Ad you have always done every single thing possible for 
      mothers
      
       comfort, for when dear Mother was here she said you was one she could
      always rely on.
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall exoect you to stay here this Summer <u>all the time you
         have</u> from your business in Washington, it will no do for you to be there in
      the hot weather like you was last Summer,
   </p>
   
   <p>I don't know what I should do if you was not coming, 
      its
      
       something to look forward to,
   </p>
   
   <p>I only hope you will be comfortable and at home here, and I know you will</p>
   
   <p>So male your arrangements to stay here all the time you have, the weather is as
      pleasant here as anywhere  and I will like to have you here, it won't make a stronger
      different in my housework
   </p>
   
   <p>I was so glad to hear that you was getting well.</p>
   
   <p>I have been perfectly well the past Winter.—The trunk dear 
      Mothers
      
       trunk is here, it is in your room I have not yet opened it, I will in a
      few days and the I will write to you It came last Wednesday
   </p>
   
   <p>Everything of dear 
      Mothers
      
       is sacred,——I have not seen dear 
      Mothers
      
       hair yet, and the [illegible], I have stood dear 
      Mothers
      
       death a great deal better that I would have thought I possibly could
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been working all the past week Dear Brother I can't write much this time, do
      be careful of yourself &amp; do try to not grieve, I am pretty well, but I feel as
      if I could not bear any more
   </p>
   
   <p>I am sorry I have not written before Now</p>
   
   <p>It was very kind &amp; thoughtgul to send the $2, for the Express, I am much 
      oblidged
