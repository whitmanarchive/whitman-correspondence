      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Rossetti,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of last summer to William O'Connor<sup><a href="#upa.00097_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> with the passages transcribed from a lady's correspondence have been shown
      me by him, and a copy lately furnished me, which I have just been re-reading. I am
      deeply touched by these sympathies &amp; convictions coming from a woman, &amp; from
      England, &amp; am sure that if the lady knew how much comfort it has been to me to
      get them, she would not only pardon you for transmitting them to Mr. O'Connor, but
      approve that action.<sup><a href="#upa.00097_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I realize indeed of such an
      emphatic &amp; smiling <em>Well done</em> from the heart &amp;
      conscience of a true wife &amp; mother, &amp; one too whose sense of the poetic, as
      I glean from your letter, after flowing through the heart &amp; conscience, also
      comes through &amp; must satisfy Science, as much as the esthetic, that I had
      hitherto received no eulogium so magnificent.<sup><a href="#upa.00097_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send by same mail with this, same address as this letter, two photographs, taken
      within a few months. One is intended for the lady (if I may be permitted to send it
      her)—and will you please accept the other with my respects &amp; love? The
      picture is by some criticized very severely indeed, but I hope you will not dislike
      it, for I confess myself to a (perhaps capricious) fondness for it as my own
      portrait over some scores that have been made or taken at one time or another.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still at work in the Attorney General's office. My p. o. address remains the
      same, here. I am, &amp; have been, quite well &amp; hearty. My new editions,
      considerably expanded, with what suggestions &amp;c. I have to offer, presented, I
      hope, in more definite, graphic form, will probably get printed, the coming spring.
      I shall forward you early copies.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send my love to Moncure Conway,<sup><a href="#upa.00097_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> if you see him. I wish he would
      write to me, soon &amp; fully. If the pictures don't reach you, or if they get
      injured on the way, I will try again by express. I wish you to read or loan this
      letter to the lady—or, if she wishes it, give it to her to keep.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00097_n1">1. William Michael Rossetti
      sent on July 13, 1869, what O'Connor termed a "precious enclosure," extracts
      from Anne Gilchrist's correspondence with the English critic. In his letter
      Rossetti described Gilchrist: "The writer is a lady of earlyish middle age,
      &amp; more than common literary cultivation. She is a person of remarkably
      strong sense, firm perception, solidity of judgment, with a rather strong
      scientific turn. My impression is that hitherto she has cared very little about
      <em>poetry</em>. …If I had been asked how this lady
      would receive Whitman's poems, I should have replied—'She will glance into
      them, set them aside in her own mind as eccentric unavailable sort of work,
      &amp; never touch the book again.' And see how utterly I should have been
      mistaken. The result fairly astonishes me" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.). Writing to Rossetti on August 28, 1869, O'Connor was obviously deeply
      moved, though he did not know "the dear lady's name," and he noted that, after
      reading the extracts, Walt Whitman's "Olympian front was surcharged with a
      tender pensiveness" (<em>Rossetti Papers</em> [New York: Charles
      Scribner's Sons, 1903], 459–460).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00097_n2">2. In his letter to
      O'Connor, Rossetti said: "I have not told her that I communicate her letters to
      any one" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). But in his diary on
      July 23, 1869, he noted that he had informed Anne Gilchrist of his action (<em>Rossetti Papers</em> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons],
      404). Gilchrist began to expand her comments in September, and on November 19,
      1869, Rossetti "finished transcribing Mrs Gilchrist's paper on Whitman"; see <em>Rossetti Papers</em> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons,
      1903], 411, 415, and <em>Letters of William Michael Rossetti</em>,
      ed. Clarence Gohdes and Paull Franklin Baum (Durham: Duke University Press,
      1934), 27–45. At the time Whitman wrote to Rossetti, he probably had
      received the new version.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00097_n3">3. Though Walt Whitman did
      not realize that Anne Gilchrist's passion included his person as well as his
      poetry, this letter, which Rossetti gave to her, served to inflame her ardor.
      See her letter to Rossetti on January 1, 1870 (<em>Rossetti
         Papers</em> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1903], 497).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00097_n4">4. On , Rossetti informed Walt Whitman
      that he had conveyed "your cordial message" to Conway, who had recently returned
      from Russia.<a href="#r4">[back]
