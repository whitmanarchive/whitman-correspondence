      <br></br><br></br>Dear Edw'd Carpenter,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Y'rs came yesterday with the draft $174.37—best &amp; heart-felt
      thanks—it will help me deeply—You speak of the <em>original draft</em> sent me in May last—no such draft has been rec'd or
      seen or heard of by me, &amp; must have been either lost or miscarried or something
      else—So I shall use <em>this</em> at once<sup><a href="#tex.00476_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p> 
   
   <p>I am still cribb'd up in the sick room, now over seven months, but easier &amp; freer
      of late—as I believe I told you in a letter three weeks ago<sup><a href="#tex.00476_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—am very weak &amp; unable to get across the room
      without assistance—but have a good strong nurse<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r4">4</a></sup>—&amp; good medical supervision—sit up most of the days.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am wanting to envelope up &amp; send some copies by Oceanic Express of my "Complete
      Works," a big 900 page Vol.<sup><a href="#n4195" id="r5">5</a></sup> (one copy for you), all directed to my friend R.
      Pearsall Smith,<sup><a href="#n4979" id="r6">6</a></sup> 44 Grosvenor Road, the Embankment,
      London—will send you word when I do so—also wish you to give me address
      of Misses Ford<sup><a href="#loc.01238_n2" id="r7">7</a></sup> (give them my love) to whom I send a copy
      in same package—As I finish I am comfortable—sitting in my big chair
      here by the oak fire—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Edward Carpenter | Millthorpe | near Chesterfield | England. It is postmarked:
      (?) | Jan (?) | 8 PM | 89.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="tex.00476_n2">2. Whitman explained the
      error at length (with many interpolations) in <em>The
         Commonplace-Book</em>: "A <em>very bad</em> (never so bad
      before) lapse of my own memory. Edw'd Carpenter sent me a bank draft $174:37,
      last part of May, '88, wh' by Lou or Mrs: D[avis] I deposited (I was very ill at
      the time bedfast) in Bank July 2. Then in Jan: '89, not hearing of the first
      draft &amp; fearing it lost, E C sent me <em>the same draft</em>
      in duplicate, &amp; I forgetting all ab't the <em>first</em> (I
      had not rec'd it &amp; supposing it lost) deposited it &amp; was credited in
      Bank. Of course on presenting it for payment (to J M Shoemaker &amp; Co.
      bankers) they spoke of the paid original draft, &amp; I gave the Camden bank my
      cheque $174:37" (<em>The Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E.

   <p id="n4319">4. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n4195">5. Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), a volume Whitman often referred to
      as the "big book," was published by Philadelphia publisher David McKay in
      December 1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, he made the presswork and
      binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the book, which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more information on
      the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n4979">6. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.01238_n2">7. Isabella Ford
      (1855–1924) was an English feminist, socialist, and writer. Elizabeth
      (Bessie) Ford was her sister. Both were introduced to Whitman's writings by
      Edward Carpenter and they quickly became admirers of the aged poet.<a href="#r7">[back]
