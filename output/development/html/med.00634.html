   <p>I have only just rec'd yours of April 22d, with $24.50 from Trübner &amp; Co.<sup><a href="#med.00634_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> for which am't see receipt enclosed—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I note the order for nineteen new copies, &amp; as soon as I go back to Camden, (within
      a week) they shall be carefully forwarded to you. You speak of a remittance for of
      three guineas, promised to be forwarded by Mr. Fraser for the <em>Tobacco Plant</em> piece.<sup><a href="#med.00634_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> <em>As no such remittance has been rec'd by me, nor heard about,</em> it has probably been deferred—Mr. F. can address me, &amp; send P O order to Camden—I
      shall prepare other two pieces &amp; send him for the paper, in response to his kind request.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thanks for letter enclosures—Mr. Westness's, Mr Walters's &amp; Mr Norman's.<sup><a href="#med.00634_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Will try to send you photos for him (Thos: Dixon's<sup><a href="#med.00634_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> is not enclosed)—I keep well, for me—have been away from home <em>gallivanting</em> around, land &amp; water, &amp; especially this city, the last two months—I send you a paper
      with this.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00634_n1">1. Josiah Child was the
      agent for Trübner &amp; Company (see the letter from Whitman to
      Trübner &amp; Company of ). On
      June 25 Whitman shipped thirty-six volumes at $3.50 each, as he informed the
      firm two days later (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00634_n2">2. "Three Young Men's
      Deaths," which appeared in the April issue (2, 318–319). Whitman sent the
      article on , to John Fraser, the
      editor of the magazine. He received $15.30 for it on June 15 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book). See the letter from Whitman to John Fraser of . "The Dalliance of the Eagles"
      appeared in this magazine in November 1880 (2, 552).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="med.00634_n3">3. In the <em>Walt Whitman Review</em>, 16 (1970), 56–57, Professor Florence B.
      Freedman has identified T. D. Westness as an uneducated English admirer; see
      also Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (1906–1996), 9 vols., 3:571–573. Freedman also points out that
      Walters may be the Frank W. Walters mentioned in William Sloane Kennedy's <em>The Fight of a Book for the World</em> (West Yarmouth, MA: The
      Stonecroft Press, 1926), 41. For Henry Norman of the <em>Pall Mall
         Gazette</em>, see Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>,
      ed. Edwin Haviland Miller (New York: New York University Press,
      1961–1977), 4:62.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00634_n4">4. Thomas Dixon, an
      uneducated corkcutter of Sunderland, England, was one of Whitman's early English
      admirers. In 1856 he had bought copies of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      from a book peddler; one of these copies was later sent by William B. Scott to
      William Michael Rossetti. Dixon vigorously supported cultural projects and was
      in effect the ideal laborer of Ruskin, who printed many of his letters to the
      corkcutter in <em>Time and Tide</em> (1867). See <em>Autobiographical Notes of the Life of William Bell Scott</em>, ed. W. Minto
      (1892), 2:32–33, 267–269; Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt
         Whitman in England</em> (1934), 15–17; <em>The Works of
         John Ruskin</em>, ed. E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn (1905),
