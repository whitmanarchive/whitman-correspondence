      <br></br><br></br>Dear Boy Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter came Wednesday—You must try to cultivate &amp; keep up a gay &amp; cheerful heart,
      
      &amp; shed off botherations, &amp; the impositions of employers, &amp;c. as a duck sheds water
      
      in a rain storm—that's the best capital a fellow can have through his whole life,
      I find.
      
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>I am only so-so—had a very bad night last night—it's a tough pull Pete—still I think
      I shall come out of it—We are having it very mild here now—after snow &amp; cold the first of the week—too mild,
      like April to-day, cloudy 
      &amp; some rain. I keep myself some busy writing—have a piece in Harpers' Monthly 
      just out (February)—shall have another in the March number<sup><a href="#loc.01637_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Can't seem to do, without occupying my mind through the day—nights are worst for
      me—I cant rest well—has been so now for a month—But I must not fill my letter with my complaints—To-day
      is just a Year, since I was paralyzed, (23d Jan. '73)—What a year it has been to me—Good bye my loving boy—write me all the news &amp;
      gossip.
      
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
