      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Family sickness has prevented an early reply to yours of 12th rec'd three or four
      days ago.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Horace Wentworth has bought of the assignees the stock of T&amp;E.<sup><a href="#loc.00584_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> In said stock are Plates of Leaves of Grass.  These plates were included in a lot
      of plates sometime ago mortgaged to Isaac Tower for money we raised of him.  The mortgage
      purports to belong to Isaac Tower but from all we have seen Wentworth was the real
      mortgagee &amp; used Tower for a blind—so that the plates are in W's hands fast &amp; tight.
      The assignees threatened at one time to break up the mortgage so as to have Tower's
      claim come in on a par with those of the general creditors.  But as Wentworth has
      now possession of our old stock and is actually doing business at 116 Wash. Street,
      the presumption is that some compromise has been effected between Tower (?) &amp; the
      assignees Wentworth/Tower may have consented to release the mortgage &amp; have thus secured a good
      bargain from the assignees.—The upshot is that your plates are in Wentworth's hands.—
   </p>
   
   <p>I think you had best correspond with Wentworth &amp; he will answer by hand of our old
      book keeper Mr. Honeybun whom W. has hired—
   </p>
   
   <p>As Wentworth is an illiterate man and knows not <em>real</em> merit in literature I think he will not be inclined go to expense extra to make additions
      to L of G and yet he may—can't tell.  You had best write him.  He is a man who loves
      to be wiley sometimes &amp; therefore may defer giving you a 
      deffinite
      
       answer to your questions of him—especially in view of the present unsettled condition
      of the Country. Even after he makes a promise, the fulfilment is often very tardy<sup><a href="#loc.00584_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>.—
   </p>
   
   <p>He is our, or rather <em>my</em> bitter and relentless enemy &amp; therefore it would be a difficult matter for either
      myself or Eldridge to get any satisfactory knowledge of his intentions with regard
      to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Things are decidedly uninteresting with me.  I have known the want of money sadly
      since our failure and the value of true friendship.  I have suffered much mentally;
      have endured severe discipline; my darling wife has been sick a great deal, and though
      uncomplaining at my misfortunes, yet worried and 
      harrassed
      
       by our deprivations.  I have been unsuccessful in getting employment, though I now
      hope for a clerkship in our Boston Post office.—I have the "war fever" very severely,
      which unlike other fevers with me preys inward and does not show itself externally.  Nothing but the home duties which <em>for the present</em> are absolute, prevent a speedy offering of myself to the Government as a soldier.
      True I might not prove strong enough for much hard work but I <em>could</em> fire my gun once and die, for my country.
   </p>
   
   <p>My soul swells as I contemplate the mighty issues involved in this contest.  They
      are not merely the stability of this Government, but the Abolition of slavery which
      alone is to send this nation to a most glorious destiny.  Either under one confederacy
      or two, we shall have no peace until slavery is crushed out, even if negotiations
      for peace between the two sections, permit slavery to still live.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mrs. Thayer desires to be remembered to her dear friend Walt Whitman with her best
      regards for that genial soul and strong man.  She would once more like to meet him face to face.—I'm sure I would.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have intended many times to write you and as often "backed out."  I wrote you one
      letter and did not send it because It was not appropriate to your feelings &amp; my own
      circumstances.
   </p>
   
   <p>My dear Walt I am not yet <em>conquered</em>.  I have everything external to crush me and stinging poverty to freeze my heart,
      but my <em>day is coming</em>.  Perhaps for a year I shall live an isolated life, but the events are now combining
      that shall 
      develope
      
       for me a destiny unlike my past career.  I know not where my "star" will travel,
      but that it will course through space &amp; hover over the particular field of my marked out labors I do not doubt. That field will be extensive and arduous,
      but not in business life.  I live in hope, golden hope that stands by me still.
   </p>
   
   <p>Wentworth has done all he could to prejudice the creditors against us and has lied
      about us so that many think we are swindlers.  I guess if we had been neither Charley
      nor myself would be as poor as we are.  The assignees acknowledged after examining
      our affairs that we have not committed the wholesale robbery ascribed to us by W.—Yet
      with all my personal enemies to traduce me, I care not, for conscious within, that
      their aspersions are unfounded I can afford to be victorious and live.  I <em>will not</em> be crushed.  I <em>will</em> live.  God bless you my dear man. How I wish <em>I</em> could bless you <em>substantially with</em> a <em>hundred</em> "spot" but who knows but that in the future I may be able to be a substantial friend to you.—Well good bye for now.  I will write you
      again soon.  Charley sends regards.
