      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have not heard any thing from you the last week, but I hope you are well &amp; every
      thing goes right. I sent you a letter last Tuesday, as usual. I suppose you have got
      your copy of the new book—I feel satisfied with the looks of it—it might be better,
      &amp; handsomer paper, &amp;c—but I am glad it turns out as good as it is—for, in making a
      book, you can't be certain how it is going to look, till it is all completed. Then
      I feel sure it tells the meaning better than any of the former editions—My enemies,
      &amp; those who are determined to find fault, will of course still do so—But I feel that
      the book proves itself to any fair person—&amp; will have a fair chance now, &amp; go ahead.
      But the best thing is, it is <em>done</em>—&amp; I shant worry myself any more with fixing &amp; revising it—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have sent a copy to Han—&amp; wrote her a letter—I am feeling first rate in health—I
      have a good place to eat—get good victuals &amp; plenty of 'em—After the biggest rain-storm
      I ever knew, we have splendid weather here just now. In the office here, every thing
      goes on the same as usual. I like Mr. Stanbery—Ashton, the Assistant, will probably
      remain here this winter—I hope Jeff won't neglect to vote—George of course will vote—Love
      to Mat—Well good bye, dear mother, till next time.<sup><a href="#nyp.00211_n100" id="r2">2</a></sup>
