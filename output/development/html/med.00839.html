   </p>
   
   <p>Yours rec'd—Yes, I will sit to Warren Davis<sup><a href="#n4166" id="r2">2</a></sup> the
      painter—w'd like to have it over with in five or six sittings—In May w'd
      suit me, as far as I see at present—W'd probably accept any time that might
      suit W D who had better write to me a little in advance—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am still living here &amp; comfortable &amp; in good spirits enough but probably
      near the end of my rope—badly paralyzed &amp; do not go out at all, except by
      being <em>toted</em>—Am real glad to hear from you once
      more—Wish you had told ab't y'r brother &amp; sister,<sup><a href="#med.00839_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; the latter's
      children.
   </p>
   
   <p>Best love &amp; remembrances to you &amp; them—I hear from Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> often—he is well—Still Superintendant in
      Canada—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Helen E. Price (b. 1841) was the
      daughter of Whitman's close friend; women's rights activist Abby Price and her
      husband Edmund. Helen wrote about Whitman's friendship with her mother, both in
      a chapter in Richard Maurice Bucke's 1883 biography of the poet and in a 1919
      newspaper article. For more on Price, see Sherry Ceniza, "Price, Helen E. (b.
      1841)," <em>The Routledge Encyclopedia of Walt Whitman</em>, ed.
      J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York: Routledge, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00839_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Miss Helen E. Price | Woodside | Queens county | New York. It is postmarked:
      Camden (?) | Apr 12 | 4 30 PM | 88; Woodside | Apr | 13 | 188(?) | N.Y.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4166">2. Warren Davis (1865–1928) was
      an American artist best known for his tempura paintings and his etchings of
      young women. He studied at the Art Students League in New York, and several of
      his etchings were used on the covers of magazines, including <em>Vanity Fair</em> and <em>Life</em>. His proposed Whitman
      painting apparently never materialized.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00839_n3">3. Helen Price had a brother
      named Arthur (b. 1840), who became an engineer in the U.S. Navy, and a sister
      named Emily, who married an artist named Law in 1869; Whitman mentions Emily's
      first baby in a letter to Abby Price on April 21, 1871. A younger brother, Henry
      (b. 1850), died in infancy.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
