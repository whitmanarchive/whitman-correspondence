      Nov: 28 1884<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.04179_n7" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      </span><span>
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p> One of your always welcome &amp; ever venerated tokens has
      reached me here tonight (closely following a predecessor);
      in the shape of "The Critic" for Nov 8, containing lines by you, which show that
      the old Master has not lost his own inimitable cunning.<sup><a href="#loc.04179_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p> I also hear from a dear friend of mine Edward Clifford<sup><a href="#loc.04179_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      that he has been seeing you, &amp; (what is very valuable news) that he has made a
      drawing of you. This I shall get a sight of, doubtless, soon after his return to
      England—in photograph at least. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Now I want to tell you why it is I have never lately sent you tokens in the shape
      of
      work by me. It is not from want of love for you, not because I am not always in
      communion with you:—<u>that</u> I am, &amp; so are all my
      friends; there is a fine young fellow, son of Col Brackenbury,<sup><a href="#loc.04179_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> lying dead now in my neighbor's house, whose mother
      brought  me back
      to day a copy of Leaves of Grass 
      wh.
      
       I had lent him last March &amp; 
      wh.
      
       had been his constant companion ever since. 
   </p>
   
   <p> No: it is not that I do not love you, &amp; do not dwell with you, that I have sent
      no token of my work. One reason is that I judge my work unworthy of you in the first
      place, &amp; in the second place so contrary to your canons of literary production that
      I can hardly imagine you can care for it. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Now, however, I hurl from 3 several publishers three little books at your devoted
      (most sacred) head:—just to show you that the chord of sympathy 
      wh.
      
       finds me as disciple in soul to you is still [
      <span class="unclear">glowing?</span>]
      ; even though the
      conditions in 
      wh.
      
       I have been developed, prevent me from following your precepts further
      than in the resolute endeavor to be sincere &amp; thorough. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p> You will see that I have stamped my two books of Sonnets with the heraldic coat
      borne by my ancestors for the last five hundred years. The 3 trefoils signify for
      me
      "The Whole, the Good, the Beautiful," as is shown by the motto from Goethe. You may
      not object to the "feudalism" of these arms, if I tell you that our patriot John
      Hampden<sup><a href="#loc.04179_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> bore them by right of his wife (my
      Maternal ancestress), &amp; that Samuel Symonds<sup><a href="#loc.04179_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      brought them to America in 1639 or thereabouts as Depty Govr. of New England under Winthrop. He gave the names to Ipswich &amp;
      Toppesfield (ancestral places of England) in that state. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I have made this discourse to conquer any prejudice wh. you might feel against books
      stamped with so effete &amp; obsolete a gimcrack as a coat of arms! One Sonnet on p:
      145 of "Vagabunduli Libellus"<sup><a href="#loc.04179_n8" id="r7">7</a></sup> explains the meaning of that coat for me. 
   </p>
   
   <p> In sections "Among the Mountains" &amp; "Envoy to a Book", you will find many
      Sonnet-references to my life up here, 5200 feet above sea-level. It is not a bad
      life. I have wife &amp; children around me, home of my own, nearly all the peasants
      for familiar 
      friends (especially young fellows, drivers, teamsters, post officials, farmers),
      &amp; have besides a heap of books &amp; plenty of literary work to do—this last,
      however, not remunerative. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I suffer from a chronic disease of the lungs, the result of breaking an artery
      seven years ago while riding a stubborn horse in England. But I find that much
      exercise in the open air &amp; regular habits give me a fair amount of physical
      vigour yet; enough to enjoy the society of simple folk &amp; to carry on the sort of
      work I have selected. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I will send you photos of my house, myself (done by Clifford), &amp; 3 of my
      daughters. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I am sincerely glad to hear that you are still tolerably hearty &amp; around among
      your friends. Believe me most sincerely yours 
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>John Addington Symonds—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I always feel Calamus more deeply than any part of your work; &amp; the reason
      why I have not published much that I have written about your poems, is that I
      cannot get quite to the bottom of Calamus. I wish I had your light upon it!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
