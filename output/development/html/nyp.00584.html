         War</em> (1875–1876).

      Redfield. The volume was an eighty-four-page pamphlet that consisted of three
      essays titled "Democracy," "Personalism," and "Orbic Literature," all of which
      Whitman intended to publish in the <em>Galaxy</em> magazine. Only
      "Democracy" and "Personalism" appeared in the magazine. For more information on
