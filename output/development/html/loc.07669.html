      Suppose you got the little poem<sup><a href="#n6187" id="r2">2</a></sup> in N Y World June 7 I sent—It
      was specially requested by the editor &amp; written in an hour &amp; a half &amp; sent

      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yesterday on my way up to Olive to see my wife's father, who is near the end of his
      life's journey, I read in the <u>Tribune</u> of the death of Wm
      O'Connor.<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r11">11</a></sup> 
      
      I
      
       
      was news I had been expecting for some time, yet it was a stunning blow
      for all that I know how keenly you must feel it, &amp; you have
       
      my deepest sympathy. No words come to my pen adequate to express the sense of the
      loss we have we suffered in the death of that chivalrous &amp; eloquent soul. How strange
      that his life has all passed, that I shall see or hear him no more.
   </p>
   
   <p>And it is sad to me to think that he has left behind him no work or book that at all
      expresses the measure of his great powers. What 
      a gift of speech that man had! If you can tell me anything about his last days I
      shall be very glad to hear it. Also where he is buried.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am pretty well, &amp; have been immersed in farm work for the past six weeks. We
      have rented our house to a New York man for 5 months. Julian<sup><a href="#loc.01151_n1" id="r12">12</a></sup> &amp; I live in the old
      house with a man who works for me, &amp; Ursula<sup><a href="#n0892" id="r13">13</a></sup> boards in Po'Keepsie. I hope this
      great heat for the past few days has not prostrated you. Tell Harry 
      Trauble<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r14">14</a></sup> to write to me.
   </p>
   
   <p>The wave of orchard bloom has just passed over us &amp; the world has been very
      lovely. Drop me a line my dear friend if you are able to do so.

   </p>
   
   <p>The enclosed I clipped from the Inter Ocean today, and as this is my 48th birthday,
      I am prompted by old recolections to write you 
      a few lines congratulating you on your 70th birthday. I hope you will long
      and prosper. This brings me back to 27 years ago when I used to see your sturdy form
      and kindly face in Washington. I don't know that you will remember me but I think
      you will. 
      Do you remember the young man of the 5th US Cavalary who you used to visit in Armory Square Hospital and the many times 
      you used to take me into a Restaurant and give me a
      
      good square meal. I suppose you done that to so many you would hardly remember me
      by that. for all Soldiers know to you looked upon you 
      as their friend, for you ever wore your heart on your sleeve to Old Soldier boys.
      You used to call me [
      <span class="unclear">lea?</span>]
      dy thin. I 
      well rember the last time I saw you it was in in the street in New York you had a little
      girl with you at the time, and readily recognised me. Well I have not changed so very
      much only of course somewhat older. hair sprinkled somewhat with gray. Your hair cannot
      be much more white than 
      it was in the long ago. I hope you are in good healthy and may continue so to a good
       round old age. for you deserve it well an dyou also deserve well of your
      country. for you were ever a friend of the Soldier and of your country. 27 years and
      what history for the U.S has been written in that time. For the years gone by I have
      often passed through Camden,
      and had I known it was your home I should surely have stopped to see you, that I might
      once more have crasped you by the hand and looked into 
      that kindly face and fought over our battles (once again) in Washington. I would like
      very much to hear from you. should you remember once and have the leisure and should
      I in the 
      future be near Camden. I will certainly do myself the pleasure of calling on you.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      arrangement with Frederick Oldach. Only 300 copies were printed, and Whitman
      signed the title page of each one. The volume also included the annex <em>Sands at Seventy</em> and his essay <em>A

      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;

      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see

   <p id="n4188">8. Whitman often referred to <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888) as his "big book." With
      the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made the presswork and binding decisions,
      and Frederick Oldach bound the volume, which included a profile photo of the
      poet on the title page. Philadelphia publisher David McKay published the book in
      December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

      and requested $10. When it was returned he sent it, on June 13, 1889, to the New York

   <p id="n4267">14. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
