   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Talcott Williams
      (1849–1928) was associated with the New York <em>Sun</em>
      and <em>World</em> as well as the Springfield <em>Republican</em> before he became the editor of the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in 1879. His newspaper vigorously defended Whitman
      in news articles and editorials after the Boston censorship of 1882. For more
      information about Williams, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_108.html">Williams, Talcott (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
