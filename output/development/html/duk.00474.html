      so frightened she concluded to take her
      and the storm so bad i thought it was endangering
      the childs life but they dident  go it was bad enoughf 
      for Jeff) i dont  think george<sup><a href="#duk.00425_n2" id="r9">9</a></sup> can come up
      to day he came up yesterday in the cars it
      is very bad to get here after you get out
      of the cars its awful looking place any how
      i beleeve  their  is dissatisfaction amongst the
      commisioners  so many men to work
      
      
      
      Jeff is pleased with his visit to washington
      he likes the Oconors<sup><a href="#duk.00474_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> very much says he

      beautiful Jeff told me how near you
      come to upset all the sympathy between
      you and your brother in law) you speak
      about sending the papers Walt but i think
      it would not be worth while<sup><a href="#duk.00474_n17" id="r12">12</a></sup>
      once in a while
      i see the tribune<sup><a href="#duk.00474_n11" id="r13">13</a></sup>
      i dont  get very much
      time between georges coming up every day
      and the children up here nearly all the time
      but i like so to read the speakery in the house
      i read Chandlers  speech and i generally see
      the sunday paper davis takes the times every
      day but he is so queer about it leaves it
      over to the office<sup><a href="#duk.00474_n16" id="r14">14</a></sup>
      Jeff says for to not ask him for
      it i got your letter walt yesterday with
      the 5 dollars i feel Walt sometimes as if you
      was too liberall with me but its all i have except
      sometimes 15 or 20 cents and i pay the rent too one
      month Jeff only charged me 5 dollar matty says
      he has to pay just the same as they did before
      they took the long room Jeff is very kind to
      me i wonder sometimes he is for every little
      thing is told him even to burning a little wood
      when i ought to burn coal but i let every thing slide
      along but i think matty gets better) but we get along pretty well

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00474_n18">1. This letter dates to
      February 21, 1867. "February 21" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and
      Richard Maurice assigned the year 1867. Edwin Haviland Miller also dated the
      letter February 21, 1867 (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:378). The year is consistent with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's reference to a
      February 11, 1867 speech by Michigan Senator Zachariah Chandler. Chandler's
      speech, which advocated impeaching President Andrew Johnson, was published in
      the <em>New York Times</em> on February 12, 1867.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00474_n2">3. The "perbasco region" refers
      to the surname of Louis Probasco, mentioned as a visitor in Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman.
      Probasco, an employee at Brooklyn Water Works, is first mentioned in Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's  letter
      to Walt. The phrase "perbasco region," however, is unclear and may refer to the
      Probasco family. The Whitmans had two other acquaintances named
      Probasco—Samuel R. Probasco (1833–1910), an employee at the Brooklyn
      Water Works from 1856 to 1868 and an assistant engineer in the Department of
      City Works, and Joe Probasco, mentioned as a soldier in Jeff Whitman's  letter to Walt and in Walt's
       letter to Louisa.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00474_n4">5. Julius "Jules" Mason
      (1835–1882) was a lieutenant colonel in the Fifth Cavalry and a career
      army officer. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman wrote that Mason "used to be in my
      party on the Water Works" (see his  letter to Walt). Jules Mason's sister Irene was a close friend of
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt; see Randall H. Waldron,
      ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New
      York: New York University Press, 1977], 37, 42). Jules and Irene were the
      children of Gordon F. Mason, a prominent Pennsylvania businessman. When Jeff
      departed for St. Louis in early May 1867, Mattie stayed at the Mason home in
      Towanda, Pennsylvania (Waldron, 37).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">6. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00474_n15">7. "Duty" or "Duti" was a
      nickname for Jessie Louisa Whitman (1863–1957), the younger daughter of
      Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt
      Whitman's brother and sister-in-law. This nickname is rare in Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's letters. In Louisa's letters Jessie Louisa is most often "Sis," a
      nickname that she inherited from her older sister Manahatta "Hattie" Whitman, or
      "California" in deference to Walt Whitman's private nickname, which he bestowed
      on her shortly after her birth (see Walt's  letter). For Mattie Whitman's reference to Jessie by the nickname
      "Duti," see her July 4 and July 19, 1867 letters to Louisa (Randall H. Waldron,
      ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1977], 38–41).<a href="#r7">[back]

      throat and larynx, characterized by a ringing cough.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">9. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00474_n10">10. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman visited his brother Walt Whitman in Washington in mid-February 1867.
      Jeff thereafter corresponded periodically with William D. O'Connor, and Walt
      reported on Jeff's visit in his 
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. For a time Walt lived with William D. and
      Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs,
      were to be his close associates during the Washington years. William Douglas
      O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly, William's wife, had a close
      personal relationship with Whitman. The correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00557_n13">11. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman
      (1823–1908), Walt Whitman's sister. They lived in Burlington, Vermont.
      Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor
      treatment of Hannah.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00474_n17">12. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      was replying to a query from Walt Whitman's  letter: "Mother, do you see the papers much? I can send papers to
      you."<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00474_n11">13. Horace Greeley's <em>New-York Tribune</em> was one of the leading dailies of its
      era. The <em>Weekly Tribune</em> enjoyed widespread distribution,
      with a circulation of 200,000 in 1860 (see the profile of Greeley's <em>Tribune</em> at <em>Chronicling America</em>,
      http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/).<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00474_n16">14. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman read newspapers and followed national politics avidly, hence her
      frustration that Joseph Phineas Davis had absconded with the <em>New York Times</em> and her efforts to secure Horace
      Greeley's <em>New-York Tribune</em>.<br><br> Michigan Senator
      Zachariah Chandler (1813–1879) spoke on February 11, 1867 in
      opposition to President Andrew Johnson's authority to appoint provisional
      governors over defeated Southern states without Congressional confirmation
      and argued that Johnson's usurpation of Congressional authority was adequate
      grounds for impeachment. Chandler, a founder of the Republican Party and a
      leader among Radical Republicans, pressed for impeachment, but Andrew
      Johnson was not impeached until February 1868, after he dismissed Secretary
      of War Edwin M. Stanton (see "Thirty-Ninth Congress," <em>New
         York Times</em>, February 12, 1867, 8; and see R. Hal Williams,
      "Chandler, Zachariah," <em>American National Biography
         Online</em>).<a href="#r14">[back]
