      <br></br><br></br>Mr. Walt Whitman
      <br></br>My Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I am sure you will pardon the liberty I am taking in addressing a stranger. No, not
      a stranger, for a man or a woman who writes for the people, cannot if he would, be
      a
      stranger to even the most ordinary citizen of the world.
   </p>
   
   <p> I am not accustomed thus to present my claim to acquaintanceship with writers. You
      are the first of our poets whom I have I have ever troubled with the correspondence,
      that I am told is their inevitable fate. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Now, this let[
      <span class="unclear">ter?</span>]
       I send you  has only come
      out of the reading of your late article in the North American Review which lies at
      my
      hand just finished. 
   </p>
   
   <p> May I be permitted to say, that I believe you to approach the nearest to the "Poet
      of the future"
      as you [
      <span class="unclear">prophesy?</span>]
       him to be, than any other
      existing. You are
      indeed the suggestor. You have in this article given me at least, "much to desire,
      to
      study," but alas I shall never be able "to complete in turn" greatly as I desire so
      to do. I believe in the potency of science to reconstruct society, but not being a
      poet I had not credited it with "clearing a field for verse". I will believe this
      also, adding it to my "creed" the "I believes", of my religion which years ago I
      began to put in the place of the apostolic creed of the church. I shall watch for
      this poetry of the future with the eagerness of [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">born?</span>]
       of my faith  in science and humanity.
   </p>
   
   <p> May I tell you how I have come to Walt Whitman worship? </p>
   
   <p> Twelve years ago, when just awaking from the aimless woman life into which I was
      educated, I was persuaded to read "Leaves of Grass," by my brother who believed in
      you its author. I had heard of it of course, heard very bad things of it too. I was
      certain [
      <span class="unclear">my?</span>]
       dear
      brother would not ask me to read a bad book. I was too uninformed in poetry then,
      to
      appreciate the "Leaves" as I now do. But it did not impress me as a bad book, crude
      as I was. I am and always have been very glad it did not. Other women and men whom
      I
      talked with at that time and I am sorry to say ever since called it coarse. I
      comforted myself with Thoreau's word of you in his "letters", which you doubtless
      know by heart as I do. Later I read Joseph B. Marvin's review in [
      <span class="unclear">the?</span>]
       "Radical Review"  and felt supreme
      self satisfaction in these words, "Only the voices of the manliest and the womanliest
      can rightly accentuate the words of "Leaves of Grass" etc. I had been <u>brave</u> enough to read aloud at a "Decoration Day" service
      in a church one of your pieces "Come up from the Fields Father". I am not a public
      reader and was [
      <span class="unclear">trembling with?</span>]
       fright, but I must have
      "accentuated" the poetry for it brought tears to the eyes of many, and at its close,
      Wm. C. Gannett came forward to me
      with a beautiful earnestness in his truly thoughtful face saying "who wrote that"
      "will you let me take it home". (the copy of Drum Taps). That was my hour of triumph
      for my poet.
      For I had heard Mr. Gannett say, a friend of his a lady who knew you, said you were
      "coarse." 
   </p>
   
   <p> I have waited for your vindication, with the assurance of perfect satisfaction that
      it would come. I read with delight Edmund C. Stedman's article in the late Scribner,
      not as wholly satisfactory to me as [
      <span class="unclear">Mergars's?</span>]
       in the Radical, but just and sweet and will be
      more widely seen and read than [illegible]. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I would be very glad to see you, but  that may never be. Remember me as
      one however who has always believed in you, always admired your words. If I were
      younger I would strive with all my [illegible] to do something worthy of my worship of your genius, worthy to be remembered by you.
      But at fifty years of age crippled by a poverty [
      <span class="unclear">that?</span>]
       makes me use the greatest portion of my
      energy to be economical and pursue a
      domestic vocation I cannot do much. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I must not expect to draw upon a writers time to reply to this letter. If you will
      but acknowledge its receipt, and will tell me where and when the article mentioned
      by Stedman, the "recantation of Emerson" appeared I shall esteem it a great favor.
      I
      never knew this had been written and I could never quite forgive Emerson for his
      retraction from the commendation once bestowed upon you. 
   </p>

      Very sincerely,
      <br></br>Amelia W. Bates

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01083_n1">1. Bates dated this letter
      January 18, 1880. In the letter, however, she mentions seeing E. C. Stedman's
      essay in a recent issue of <em>Scribner's Monthly</em>. Stedman's
      important essay "Walt Whitman" appeared in <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> in November 1880, so it is probable that Bates, after a year of
      writing 1880, kept doing so out of habit in the new year, momentarily forgetting
      in January that she was now in 1881.<a href="#r1">[back]
