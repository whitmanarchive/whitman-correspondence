      evening—
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will commence a letter to you, though there is nothing particular to write
      about— but it is a pleasure even to write—as I am alone a great deal yet
      in my room. It is about ½ past 8, and I am sitting here alone—I have been
      out to-day twice, riding in the cars—it is a change—the weather here is
      very pleasant indeed— if I could only get around, I should be satisfied— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I expect Peter Doyle in yet this evening, to stay an hour or two— he works
      every night except Sunday night— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Monday noonApril 7. </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, mother dear, I am now finishing my letter, over at the office seated at my
      desk— I do not feel very well. My head is still so feeble—I suppose I
      ought to be satisfied that I do not go behindhand—I send you quite a bundle of
      papers to-day— One of the Graphics with one of my pieces in<sup><a href="#nyp.00317_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—the spring seems to be opening here, the grass is
      quite green, &amp; the trees are beginning to bud out—it looks very
      pleasant— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Love to you, mama dear, &amp; all<sup xmlns=""><a href="#nyp.00317_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
