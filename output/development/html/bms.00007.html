   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="bms.00007_n2">2. Rhys's article "The
      Portraits of Walt Whitman" in the June 1889 issue of <em>The
         Scottish Art Review</em> (p. 17–24) was slapdash journalism: the painter Thomas Eakins' last name, for example,
      became "Eadie."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="bms.00007_n3">3. Whitman made a similar
      observation in <em>The Commonplace-Book</em> on July 19, 1889: "No
      sale worth mentioning of my books by myself" (<em>The
         Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
