      <br></br><br></br>Dear Hank
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing very new with me the last two weeks—how has it been with you?—Are you
      on the C &amp; A<sup><a href="#loc.04010_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> again—&amp; how about that
      Medford Station?—Write soon—(it will do you good to write &amp; fully &amp;
      carefully—I wish you would oftener)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have had something of a set-back—A rascally publisher in New York named
      Worthington has been printing and selling a cheaper edition of my book for his own
      profit, no benefit to me at all—&amp; it has been going on privately for a
      year—I only found it out for certain about ten days ago—of course it is
      quite a hurt to me—will lead to a law suit, as I shall have to sue him, &amp;
      I hate getting into law—it is almost as bad to me to sue, as to be
      sued—then it cost money—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I am jogging along here about the same—keep pretty well, &amp; eat my allowance
      every time—went over to 41st st: 
      Phila:
      
       to eat my Thanksgiving dinner, with an old friend of mine, (his wife
      &amp; two young ones)—had a good time—Came back home in a rousing snow
      storm, but got along all right—Sunday morning went to breakfast at Mr and Mrs
      Scovel's<sup><a href="#loc.04010_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I am sitting up here 3d story—warm &amp; nice, every thing as still as can
      be—it has struck 8, and the wind outside moans &amp; whistles by
      starts—have been reading the evening paper, &amp; to-day's 
      N Y
      
      
      <u>Tribune</u>—&amp; I thought I would write to you, but I am
      afraid I 
      havn't
      
       made out a very interesting letter—It was well I was down there the
      good weather middle of November—it has been bad enough since, some bitter
      cold—I have got my new overcoat, it is thick &amp; warm &amp; I like
      it—have you got the <u>new cider</u>?—Love to your father
      &amp; mother, not forgetting your share dear son—

      Whitman's Commonplace Book, Whitman often had Sunday breakfast with the Scovels.
      Though there is no entry in the notebook for November 28, he was at the
      Scovels's on December 5. The poet spent Thanksgiving with the Kilgores
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
