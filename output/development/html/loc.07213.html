   <p>I read pp 68, 69, 70 of the book<sup><a href="#loc.07510_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> (on slang) with great delight—have never
      seen it before—must be printing now from M.S.? I hope there is a lot more of
      it, it is one of the best, most original, prose things of yours I have seen so
      far. I have your letter of the 5th &amp; 6th. I fear you are not having a good time but
      it
      is a great comfort to me to know that you are at least being looked after—in
      this regard I feel sure nothing could be better than Baker<sup><a href="#loc.07541_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      &amp; Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r3">3</a></sup> and I think we are most fortunate in getting the
      assistance of these two young fellows. Yes, as you imagine I am indeed up to my eyes
       in work but one
      thing I am glad of—I have got over the engagement I had with Pardee<sup><a href="#n4274" id="r4">4</a></sup> to go to Chicago and shall be here all the time now and so on
      hand in case I should require to go to Philadelphia.

   <p>The weather here keeps extremely pleasant, warm (not <u>hot</u>)
      generally bright, refreshing showers from time to time—we are cutting our hay.
      Had the last of our strawberries and the first of our currants today All goes well
      with us.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07510_n2">1. Whitman was at this time

   <p id="loc.07541_n2">2. Nathan M. Baker was one
      of Whitman's caregivers. He would leave on July 15, 1888, to resume his medical
      training. Baker was replaced by W.A. Musgrove. For Whitman's comments on the
      transition, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.2.html">Monday, July 16, 1888</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="n4274">4. Timothy Blair Pardee
      (1830–1889) was a Canadian lawyer and politician, member of the
      Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontaria, Canada, and Minister of the
      Crown. Pardee appointed Richard Maurice Bucke, with whom he was a close friend,
      as the Superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane in Hamilton at its founding
      in 1876, and then the next year as Superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane
      in London. For more on Pardee, see H. V. Nelles, "Pardee, Timothy Blair," <em>Dictionary of Canadian Biography</em> Vol. 11 (Toronto:
