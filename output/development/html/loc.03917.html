   <p>Am quite well with the exception of the abcess on my neck, it has come again. Dr.
      B—<sup><a href="#loc.03917_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> lanced it few days ago but it dont appear to get much better.
      Recieved the papers and am glad to get them for it is the only way I can get posted.
      Most of my friends appear to have forgotten me or think me of too little importance
      to drop a line.
      Will leave here the first of next month and start for Detroit where I will put
      in a month or so if I can find bread and butter. Please send me a letter of
      introduction to someone there if you know any body it will make it much better for
      me
      and I will not feel entirely alone. I think perhaps Dr. B can give me a letter to
      some of his friends there as he is going to give a lecture there Wednesday evening.
      Don't get the blues worth a dam and dont expect to. Will close for the present.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03917_n1">1. Harry was at the time
      staying with Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian physician and
      psychiatrist. Bucke grew close to Whitman after reading (and later memorizing)
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 and meeting the poet in
      Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke claimed in 1872 that a
      reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him to experience "cosmic
      consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany. Bucke became the poet's
      first biographer with <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1883), and he later served as one of his medical advisors and literary
      executors. For more on the relationship of Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson,
