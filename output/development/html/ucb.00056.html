      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still here—not yet (as an old Long Island aunt used to say) "not yet out of my
      misery" but I go out on the streets, or to the Public Library, most every day, &amp; have
      no doubt I shall be as well as usual before long—I believe I told you I was in nice
      quarters &amp; very comfortable here<sup><a href="#ucb.00056_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I send you Mrs Gilchrist's letter, which you needn't return<sup><a href="#ucb.00056_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Gilder's, which I also enclose, I wish you to send back, some time<sup><a href="#ucb.00056_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Upon receiving this, post me a card—tell me how the mother is &amp; 'Sula, also the baby,
      also Smith<sup><a href="#ucb.00056_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Just got a postal from Mrs Gilchrist giving her address.

   <p>The rough map enclosed gives you some idea of my present jaunt, on the red line (the
      blue lines are old travels of mine)<sup><a href="#ucb.00056_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—I have seen the December <em>Scribner's</em>—What you say of me in <em>Nature &amp; the Poets</em> thoroughly delights, satisfies &amp; <em>prides</em> me<sup><a href="#ucb.00056_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—I saw in the Library a late London <em>Fortnightly</em> in which J A Symonds, touching briefly but very commendingly &amp; mentioning my name,
      makes quite an extract from <em>Dem[ocratic] Vistas</em> (summing up the general spirit of British literature as being markedly sombre &amp; bilious)<sup><a href="#ucb.00056_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>—A B Alcott is expected here, to talk—I may see him—This is quite a place for the
      most toploftical Hegelian transcendentalists, a small knot but smart—the principal
      of them, W T Harris,<sup><a href="#ucb.00056_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> editor of <em>Speculative Philosophy</em>, has been often to see me, has been very kind, &amp; I like him much—Probably ten days
      more will end my stay here, (but I am not fixed)<sup><a href="#ucb.00056_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup>—A fine day as I write, &amp; I am feeling comfortable. Best love to 'Sula—

      Whitman from England on , mentioned

      admiration is merged with love."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>

      if Whitman had read Wordsworth, "he would have made at least a qualified
      exception in his favor."<a href="#r8">[back]
