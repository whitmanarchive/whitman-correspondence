      <br></br><br></br>Dear William O'Connor:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was very ill after my arrival here—&amp; made worse by the heat—but
      have recovered<sup><a href="#nyp.00290_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—&amp; to-day, Monday, feel about the same as formerly.
      Mother is well, &amp; sends her love to you all—mother asked a great deal
      about Nelly, and also about Jenny—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My brother George is remarkably well &amp; robust this summer—he was out in all
      the excessive heat of the three latter days of last week, &amp; came home every
      evening to his supper, unflagging, &amp; full of strength &amp; fun—I quite
      envied &amp; admired him—especially as I felt deathly weak—indeed
      despicable—but, as before said, I think I am all right again now—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have not been out yet—havn't heard any news of special interest, literary or
      other—havn't seen Mrs. Price—but shall begin to explore, this
      week—&amp; will report in my next—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear Nelly, I had an unusually pleasant journey that afternoon &amp; evening in the
      cars—felt quite well—enjoyed my lunch, the cold tea, &amp;c—got
      in at Jersey City a few minutes after 10, not a bit tired—Nothing very new
      from my sisters Mat or Hannah—Eddy is as usual—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jenny, my darling, I must not forget to put in a line for you too, &amp; send my
      love—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>William,<sup><a href="#nyp.00290_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> do you see how Mrs.
      Stowe &amp; the Atlanticites are getting cuffed &amp; smitten front &amp; rear,
      anent of the Byron resurrectionism? The papers are all having articles about
      it—&amp; all condemn the Atlantic article.<sup><a href="#nyp.00290_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00290_n1">1. In his  letter to Peter Doyle, however,
      Whitman wrote that he was still "unwell most every day—some days not so
      bad."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00290_n2">2. Someone, probably William
      D. O'Connor, placed a large asterisk over this paragraph.<a href="#r2">[back]

      Harriet Beecher Stowe entered the Byron controversy with a vigorous article
      in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, 24 (September 1869),
      295–313. "The True Story of Lady Byron's Life" was based on an
      interview and some notes that Lady Byron, critically ill at the time, gave
      to her in 1856. She attacked the biographical studies of Thomas Moore and
      Countess Guiccioli, and almost deified "the most remarkable woman that
      England has produced in the century."<br><br>
      Though O'Connor's reply to Whitman is lost, he expressed his opinion of the
      article with his usual vigor to William Michael Rossetti on August 28, 1869:
      "One would fancy Mrs Stowe demented to issue this old foul romance, without
      one scrap of evidence, and pregnable on every side" (<em>Rossetti Papers</em> [New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1903], 460).
