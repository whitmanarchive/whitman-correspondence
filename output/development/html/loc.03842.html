      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Through one &amp; another source we hear of you from time to time—sometimes by your
      postals, sometimes by the press &amp; again through mutual friends. The latest accounts
      seem to be that you are better in health in which we rejoice. But both you &amp; I have
      the one disease which has never in the ages been cured—old age! The Phoenix
      business of fable don't &amp; won't come to us! What the beyond has or has not for us
      we
      may not know.
   </p>
   
   <p>We have come for the summer to a wonderfully beautiful country home—perfectly
      ideal in its fascinations &amp; scenery. Probably one third of the country around us is in
      reserved public commons and
      woods which the mountainous country displays grandly—and all only 40 miles
      south of London. For near neighbors we have Tennyson,<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      Tyndall<sup><a href="#n6162" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; quite a host of lesser lights in literature science &amp; art.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mary<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> has a cottage close at hand and her two little girls<sup><a href="#loc.01389_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      are the poetry of our old age. Your admirer &amp; friend the truly noble Lady Mount Temple<sup><a href="#loc.03842_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> is now our
      guest and we have been together reading your Autumn boughs this evening. I greatly
      wish that you could be with us here to let us minister to you!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Alys<sup><a href="#uva.00553_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> returns to Philadelphia next month to finish her
      college course and she will see you soon now &amp; tell us all about you. Logan<sup><a href="#n6122" id="r7">7</a></sup> is working hard in his college course of which he is making the
      best use. We hope for the best things for him in the future through the 
      skilful
      
       use of his pen for which all this work is preparing him. He writes very
      bright plays for us &amp; then acts them for us with his sisters. I have full use of my
      one remaining eye and am in much better health in this much criticised but really
      best of all known climates. I do not see any present prospect of our return home for at our
      age it is everything to us to be near our children in whom we mostly live what
      remains to us of life.
   </p>
   
   <p>Goodbye dear friend—let us hear from you (here till October 1st &amp; then to the
      old address of 44 Grosvenor Road Westminster London) when the spirit moves you.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0625">1. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6162">2. John Tyndall (1820–1893) was
      a British physicist, science teacher, public intellectual, and a pioneer mountain
      climber.
      He was an admirer of Tennyson, and the two became lifelong friends.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02189_n1">3. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="loc.01389_n4">4. Rachel Pearsall Conn Costelloe (1887–1940) was
      Mary's first daughter. Rachel ("Ray") eventually married Oliver Strachey
      (brother of biographer Lytton Strachey) and was a writer and women's suffrage
      activist who ran for a seat in the British parliament soon after women were
      granted the right to vote. Karin Stephen (née Catherine Elizabeth
      Costelloe) (1889–1953) was Mary's second daughter. She would become a
      British psychoanalyst and psychologist, and the wife of Adrian Stephen (psychoanalyst
      and prominent member of the 
      Bloomsbury Group, and brother of Virginia Woolf).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03842_n1">5. Lady Mount Temple was
      an admirer of Whitman; in 1888, she had sent him a gift. In a letter dated  Hempstead &amp;
      Son, a customs brokerage house in Philadelphia, notified Whitman of the imminent
      arrival of apparel sent to him by Lady Mount Temple (for more on this letter and
      on Whitman and Traubel's dealings with O.G. Hempstead &amp; Son, see Traubel,
      <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.35.html">Wednesday, May 2, 1888</a>). Whitman described Lady Mount Temple's
      present as "a beautiful vest of knit stuff, wool, &amp; silk" in his letter to
      Robert Pearsall Smith of .<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="uva.00553_n3">6. Alys Smith (1867–1951)
      was Mary's sister. She would eventually marry the philosopher Bertrand
      Russell.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6122">7. Logan Pearsall Smith
      (1865–1946) was an essayist and literary critic. He was the son of Robert
      Pearsall Smith, a minister and writer who befriended Whitman, and he was the
      brother of Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, one of Whitman's most avid followers.
