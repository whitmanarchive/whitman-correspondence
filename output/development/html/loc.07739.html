   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Dr Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. |

   <p id="loc.03012_n1">2. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy of .<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n0116">3. Robert Browning (1812–1889) was an English
      poet known for his dramatic monologues, including "Porphyria's Lover" and "My
      Last Duchess." Browning was also the husband of poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning
      (1806–1861).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07739_n2">4. Bucke had written on : "I have spent part of the day
      looking over L. of G. and I wish I could tell you, or convey to you in the
      faintest way, the deep down emotions that that book excites in me. There is
      nothing stirs me up like it. Sometimes as I read it I feel as if my whole
      previous life were rolling en masse through me, and as if at the same time vast
      vistas were opening ahead which I longed and yet half dreaded to enter. The
      profound religious sentiment which that book is destined to develope in the
      human heart when it becomes once assimilated by (incorporated into) the life of
      the race is, I think, simply inconceivable at present."<a href="#r4">[back]
