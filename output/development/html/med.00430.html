   <p>I wonder if you either of you have any idea how the otherwise monotony of my Camden
      existence has been pleasantly rippled—how warm &amp; bright those gleams to me—from the
      unvarying hospitality and sweet friendship of both of you—God bless you.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00430_n1">1. Among Whitman's early
      friends at Camden was John R. Johnston, "the jolliest man I ever met, an artist,
      a great talker," per Whitman's 
      letter to Peter Doyle. Johnston was a portrait and landscape painter who for
      years maintained a studio in Philadelphia and lived at 434 Penn Street in
      Camden. See <em>The New-York Historical Society Dictionary of
         Artists in America, 1564–1860</em> (New Haven: Yale University Press,
      1957). On the verso of Anne Gilchrist's letter of , Whitman scrawled some trial lines for an
      inscription: "written in memory of the good times Sunday evening's in Penn
      street, 1875—'4 &amp; '3." The poet was fond of Johnston's children, Ida
      and Jack (John Jr.).<a href="#r1">[back]
