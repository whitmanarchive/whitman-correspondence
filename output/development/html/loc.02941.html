      <br></br>(best loved friend)
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The enforced infrequency of my gossippy letters turns often to my advantage, since
      it
      brings you out in a nice page letter to know why the garrulous voice from Belmont
      (the cicada) has intermitted its notes. (Just laid my pen down to see to a sick cat
      I
      am doctoring: how curious the habit we have of laying a pen down, &amp; forgetting
      totally where we put it!)
   </p>

   <p>Your Kottabos<sup><a href="#n6176" id="r2">2</a></sup>

       &amp; letter. Why, yes, I confess I felt a good deal of sympathy for our
      cranky friend Johnson<sup><a href="#n0914" id="r3">3</a></sup> the planter His insinuations as to assumed peccadiloes of 
      yrs
      
       were of no importance in <u>my eyes</u> but such things
      if spoken of to third parties sometimes do mischief. Though, supposing all the
      things he mentioned were so, (and doubtless some of them were in a measure) they 
      wd
      
       not affect a <u>rational</u> man's temper or friendship
      a jot. But, unfortunately, our fellow-men are far from being rational.
   </p>
   
   <p>¶</p> 
   
   
   <p>I have written to Tennyson<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r4">4</a></sup> asking him (and stating that I of
      course wrote without the knowledge of any one else) if he 
      wd
      
       like to say a few words of you for the appendix to the book. Also wrote to

      send me a statement as to "Walt Whitman in Italy."

   <p>I had a long letter fr Charley Eldridge,<sup><a href="#n0210" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      
      wh.
      
       I incorporated partly in the Bibiliog. under head of "1860 edition." He says he finds

       I paid 3.00 to Clark here 8 
      yrs

   <p>I am in despair as to getting any time for intellectual life or correspondence. I
      work at office 9 hours. I think I must solve the problem by having both wife &amp; I
      get our chief meal at 6

   <p>Rhys's<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r8">8</a></sup> Chickering Hall lecture being worse than a failure
      (financially) some of his Back Bay friends have got him up a private lecture in
      grand style, &amp; passed around the hat to the tune of $200. Chamberlin<sup><a href="#loc.02941_n4" id="r9">9</a></sup> who writes the Listener to the <u>Transcript</u> had Rhys at his home
      for a month. Rhys drove him frantic, as he did us, &amp; Chamberlin one day <u>disappeared</u> leaving R. with the three children. C's
      friends find him out; doctor says he is over-worked; send him to Savannah (that is
      the reason <u>Listener</u> is so brief lately, as you see); C's
      wife comes home (she was in Chicago) &amp; R.  leaves, &amp; goes to the house of
      Kate Gannett Wells.<sup><a href="#loc.02941_n5" id="r10">10</a></sup> It is a dreadful pity that R. is so on the wrong track as to the
      ethics of labor,—poor fellow. He will have to face about squarely, &amp; get
      out of this soon, or he is lost.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have not much faith in the despatch of F.W. Wilson:<sup><a href="#n6175" id="r11">11</a></sup> we must let him drag, I
      suppose. I have sent him 20 names. 
      He <u>must</u> have a hundred, at least, by this time. Not a <u>written</u> word 
      fr.
      
       him since I sent him the 150 circulars. But he is evidently crawling on,
      tortoise-style.

   <p>My dear father-confessor, I feel a strong desire to be clasped closer  to 
      yr
      
       breast, to <u>know</u> my friend in more intimate
      personal ways (for I feel that I am worthy of 
      yr
      
       richest love &amp; confidence). I am longing to have a few good old style
      talks on many subjects, &amp; for that purpose am secretly laying by (little by
      little) a small sum for expenses of a week's visit.
   </p>
   
   <p>In a week I shall be put into a room to read first proof for six or seven weeks.
      About the first week in June then, I <u>expect</u> to have a
      change again, when I shall be able to run down to see you. They are training me up
      for a permanent reader (corrector of the press).
   </p>
   
   <p>To-day, having a bad cold, I am staying at home; hence, this letter to you</p>
   
   <p>Give my love to Scovel<sup><a href="#n1049" id="r12">12</a></sup> &amp; O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r13">13</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I discovered still another flattering reference to you by Nencioni recently in Antologia
      
      (in a noble article by him on Hugo's<sup><a href="#n4276" id="r14">14</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

      a miscellany of verse and prose—including translations from Greek and Latin—first
      published in 1874. The
      editor was R. Y. Tyrrell, Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and many of the
      contributors were present and former Trinity men. See Whitman's letter to Kennedy

   <p id="n0914">3. John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0625">4. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r4">[back]

      popularization of English literature in Italy. For more on Nencioni, see
