   <p>Charley, you would do me a special service if you could
      get &amp; send me a good photo (or other picture) of <em>Father
         Taylor, the old sailor preacher</em>. I want it to be engraved for a magazine
      article<sup><a href="#loc.05771_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Picture will be returned—also
      find out for me when Father T died—No particular hurry—but hope you will
      be able to help me soon as convenient—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have had a bad spell nearly all the year—till ab't a month ago—when
      things turn'd favorably, &amp; I am now about as usual with me—
   </p>

      With good old remembrances—
      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05771_n1">1. The article, "Father
      Taylor and Oratory," did not appear until 1887. Whitman heard Edward Thompson
      Taylor (1793–1871) preach in the Seaman's Chapel in Boston in 1860 (Gay
      Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan,
      1955], 239).<a href="#r1">[back]
