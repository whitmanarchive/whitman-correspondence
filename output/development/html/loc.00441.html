   </p>
   
   <p>I received your letter last Friday<sup><a href="#loc.00441_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I should have sent the bundle before but Mother told me that you said you was coming
      home<sup><a href="#loc.00441_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and we have been expecting to see you all the last week &nbsp;Mother left last Monday—we
      had a letter from her the next Wednesday—she arrived all right—found Han better than
      she expected she says<sup><a href="#loc.00441_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &nbsp;I have been suffering since Friday with a "run-around" on my middle finger &nbsp;I have
      been unable to do anything for the last three days—and seems to me I never suffered
      so much pain before in so short a time—I send the bundle this morning by Wescotts
      express—you must forgive me for not attending to it before—I should have done so had
      not Mother told me you was coming home &nbsp;And Walt why dont you come home &nbsp;we would be glad to see you and I think you would enjoy a visit home just now—come
      and make us a visit—George has started in his building business<sup><a href="#loc.00441_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—he is in hopes of getting a pretty large job in New York—will know to-day—Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00441_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> offered him a first rate berth—he thought at first he would take it but afterwards
      declined—perhaps he did better in going on with his venture—
   </p>
   
   <p>Everything is going the same all rosey—we hope you will come on and see us—I am in a great hurry this morning—or would write
      longer
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00441_n1">1. Whitman's letter of
      about September 8, 1865, is not extant.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00441_n2">2. Whitman took roughly "a
      month's furlough" in Brooklyn from early October to November 7, 1865 (Edwin
      Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 1:267, n. 57).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00441_n3">3. On September 4, 1865,
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman travelled to Burlington, Vermont, to visit Hannah and
      Charles Heyde. Mrs. Whitman was pleased to see that Hannah was in good health
      and had plenty to eat, but she found it "the greatest hardship...to be pleasant"
      to Charles (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman, September 11, 1865
      [Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and
      Special Collections Library]).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00441_n4">4. After the war George
      entered the speculative building business with a man named Smith. In September
      1865 George hoped to construct an office building in New York City but lost the
      contract because, as he explained to his mother, "The architect was in favor of
      the new york bosses" (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <em>Civil War Letters
         of George Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University
      Press, 1975], 27–28).<a href="#r4">[back]
