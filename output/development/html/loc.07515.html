   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07515_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr R M Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario Canada. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J.
      | Jan (?) | 6 PM | 88.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07515_n2">2. At nine o'clock on the
      same evening Whitman was not so optimistic in his <em>Commonplace
         Book</em> entry: ". . . Cold in the head keeps on—grows worse I
      think—any thing like easy bodily movement will soon be impossible—it
      is very nearly so now—trouble in head, kidney botheration pretty bad,
      joints all gone, locomotion &amp; movement gone—mentality all right
      yet—&amp; spirits far better than could be expected—appetite
      fair—sleep, minus to tolerable" (Whitman's Commonplace Book; Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07515_n4">3. Thomas Eakins
      (1844–1919) was an American painter. His relationship with Whitman was
      characterized by deep mutual respect, and he became a close friend of the poet.
      Eakins resumed work on his portrait of the poet on January 14, 1888 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book; Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07515_n5">4. Whitman's quotation here
      echoes Percy Bysshe Shelley's sonnet "England 1819," which opens by describing
      King George III as an "old, mad, blind, despised, and dying King."<a href="#r4">[back]
