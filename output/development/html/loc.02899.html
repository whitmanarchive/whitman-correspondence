   </p>
   
   <p>
      
      Yrs
      
       of the 8th 
      recd.
      
      Yes; I 
      rec'd
      
      Knortz's<sup><a href="#uva.00476_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
      pam.
      
       in same mail with 
      yr
      
       letter. I have read it &amp; find it good—comprehensive, scholarly,
      &amp; fair. I 
      wd
      
       not want a better or more <u>complete</u> introduction
      to the whole German nation than that contained in his pamphlet. I see no trace of
      clericalism in it. He devotes five pages to an earnest &amp; unqualified defense of
      Children of Adam though as he says, you do "smoke pretty strong tobacco" [!] in
      those poems. He finds "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" the finest, tenderest
      &amp; most soul mastering Bird—
      idyl
      
       in the whole literature of the world. He covers the whole ground (hastily)
      without however, rising ever into any very profound or original thought. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Did you find that letter of Rhys's?<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> I will gladly accept 
      yr
      
       suggestion as to title "Walt Whitman" &amp;c 
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I 
      shd
      
       like very much to have something about Scovel<sup><a href="#loc.03298_n10" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      to put in if anybody 
      cd
      
       give me a few data. He has been such a good friend. I know Donaldson<sup><a href="#syr.00024_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> so little that I hardly know whether to clan him with
      Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r6">6</a></sup> or not: I hardly dare to state here on paper the
      uncertainties I feel about him. You see how that I have written about him strikes
      you when you come to read the MS. I may omit it altogether. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I have preluded &amp; bragged so much (as is my naïve way) that I guess I'd
      better give you now a hint as to the "spine" of my book. It is a good deal of a <u>melange</u>; but I believe the back-bone idea of it lies in
      the word "apotheosis." 
   </p>
   
   
   <p> Here are the contents: </p>

   <span>Chap I <u>Enfans d'Adam</u></span><br>

   <span>2 <u>Concordance</u></span><br>
   <span>3 <u>Bibliography</u></span><br>
   
   
   
   <p> The first three chapters attempt to once &amp; for all set at rest the uncertainty
      as to the purity &amp; supreme worth of Leaves of Grass, &amp; the greatness of W.
      W. as a man &amp; author. They form a tremendous eulogium, &amp; seem to me to be
      exhaustive &amp; unanswerable. 
   </p>
   
   <p> The next three chapters are interpretative &amp; analytical chiefly. </p>
   
   <p> The seventh is personal.<sup><a href="#loc.02893_n1" id="r7">7</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p> But I must stop &amp; get to work on it. For serious interruptions are looming up in
      the near future. A publisher buttonholed me in Boston yesterday.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00476_n1">1. Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03310_n1">2. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03298_n10">3. James Matlack Scovel
      (1833–1904) worked as a layer in Camden before entering the New Jersey
      legislature during the Civil War and becoming a colonel in 1863. He campaigned
      actively for Horace Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S.
      Treasury during Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to
      Scovel's home for Sunday breakfast. For a description of these breakfasts, see
      <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed. William Sloane
      Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel, see George R.
      Prowell's <em>The History of Camden County</em>, New Jersey
      (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="syr.00024_n3">4. Thomas Donaldson
      (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
      introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
      the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
      carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt
         Whitman, the Man</em> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see
      Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_111.html">Donaldson, Thomas (1843–1898)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">5. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">6. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02893_n1">7. As euphoric as Kennedy
      sounds in this letter, his book-length study of Whitman would not see the light
      of day until 1896, when it was published as <em>Reminiscences of
         Walt Whitman</em>.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0141b">8. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
