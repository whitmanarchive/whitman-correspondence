      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We received your letters with the advertisement which will
      be attended to.<sup><a href="#loc.00579_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> We cannot however stereotype your little
      book now, as we have so much already underway. We shall hardly be ready for it under
      two
      months, but shall certainly commence on it by the first of January.
   </p>
   
   <p>In regard to money matters, we are very short ourselves and it is quite impossible
      to
      send you the sum you name. We would if we could.<sup><a href="#loc.00579_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Business will be stagnant with us till after the Presidential election when with our
      new books we shall get up a rush,
   </p>

   <p>P.S. We will let you know when we are ready for the Banner at Daybreak, so as to give
      you ample time to make preparations to come on

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thayer and Eldridge was
      the Boston publishing firm responsible for the third edition of Walt Whitman's
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00579_n2">1. Whitman had sent Thayer and
      Eldridge the text for a full-page announcement of his proposed new volume of
      poetry,<em>The Banner At Day-Break</em> (though the book was
      never published). The advertisement discussed here appears at the back of
      William Douglas O'Connor's <em>Harrington</em> and describes <em>The Banner At Day-Break</em> as "a handsome volume of about
      200 pages," including the new poems "Banner At Day-Break," "Washington's First
      Battle," "Errand-Bearers," "Pictures," "Quadrel," "The Ox-Tamer," "Poemet,"
      "Mannahatta," "The Days," and "Sonnets," plus a "supplement containing
      criticism." (For a discussion of Whitman's plans for <em>The
         Banner At Day-Break</em>, see Ted Genoways, <em>Walt Whitman
         and the Civil War</em> [University of California Press, 2009],
      77–103.)<a href="#r1">[back]
