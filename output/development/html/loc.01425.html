      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We have
      been forming here a little club, or series of meetings, for authors and writers, and
      it has seemed to several who have a good deal to do with the management of the club
      that you, although only now &amp; then in New York, ought to belong to it. I have no
      sort of doubt that at the next meeting (the 20th) you will be  elected a member if you wish to
      belong. The initiation fee is fifteen dollars, the annual dues ten. Is there any
      chance of you being in town next Wednesday? If so, I could guarantee that at the
      business meeting at 8 o'clock you would be elected &amp; at nine you could come in,
      as <u>my guest</u> for the Evening. For our system includes one
      guest asked by each member. Please let me hear from you at once—whether you
      would like to have your name  put up and also whether you will come, as guest, to the next
      meeting. The club is just organised. Thirty-eight well known &amp; less well known
      writers have been approached. 36 have accepted. Our present limit is 50, and
      probably five or ten will be elected next Wednesday. I want your name to head the
      list, not merely because of my esteem for you personally, but because of your
      importance in American letters. The club contains all the representative men who can
       be called
      littérateurs, the managers of the four leading reviews &amp; magazines, &amp;c,
      &amp;c, &amp; will doubtless embrace a number of the working men of letters in other
      cities. So you see the need of decision before the limit of membership is reached.
      I
      enclose you an odd copy of our circular call to the 38 &amp; of the summons to our
      first regular meeting, at which I sincerely hope that the "good gray" will be a
      prominent figure. Let me know soon.
   </p>

   <p><u>Come as guest, whether you join or not!</u></p>
   
   
   <p>I think your last book throws more light on you &amp; your work
      than anything yet
      published. No novel is so absorbing.<sup><a href="#loc.01425_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
