   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00479_n11">1. "April 13" is in Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1867. Edwin
      Haviland Miller accepted Bucke's year (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:378), and the date is correct. Because this letter describes Louisa as living
      in the country and away from the bustle, she was living at Pacific Street and
      caring for the daughters of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman. The only date consistent with all of these matters is April
      13, 1867.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">2. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00440_n3">3. Manahatta Whitman
      (1860–1886), known as "Hattie," was the daughter of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven years of her life in
      the same home with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was especially close to her
      grandmother. Hattie and her younger sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957) were
      both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n3">4. "California" was a
      nickname for Jessie Louisa Whitman (1863–1957), the younger daughter
      of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman.
      Though Louisa Van Velsor Whitman referred most often to her granddaughter as
      "Sis"—a nickname that Jessie Louisa inherited when her older sister
      Manahatta became "Hattie"—Walt Whitman apparently bestowed the private
      nickname "California" on Jessie Louisa shortly after her birth (see his  letter to Louisa). According
      to Louisa's  letter to Walt,
      Jessie Louisa recognized the name's association with Walt: "she calafor when
      uncle comes home."<br><br>
      Edward Whitman (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest
      son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required
      lifelong assistance for significant physical and mental disabilities, and he
      remained in the care of his mother until her death. During Louisa's final
      illness, Eddy was taken under the care of George Washington Whitman and his
      wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with financial support from Walt
      Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="duk.00479_n7">6. A memorial stone for a
      Rebecca Denton Van Velsor (1791?–1871) is present in Brooklyn's Green-Wood
      Cemetery, and the woman identified by Louisa Van Velsor Whitman as "Aunt Becca"
      may be a great aunt or other distant relative of Walt Whitman. Aunt Becca is
      mentioned also Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters of  and .<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n14">7. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      at the beginning of May 1886 had moved to Pacific Street, which was adjacent to
      Prospect Park (see Walt Whitman's 
      letter to Louisa). Prospect Park extended to the eastern edge of Brooklyn in
      1866, and it was far less developed than the more urban setting of the Portland
      Avenue home from which she had departed.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">8. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">9. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="duk.00479_n13">10. In letters that followed
      Walt Whitman consistently promised to visit Brooklyn soon. He arrived on May 4,
      1867 (see his  letter to William D.
      O'Connor).<a href="#r10">[back]
