   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00078_n1">1. This note is addressed: T
      W H Rolleston | Lange Strasse 29 | Dresden | Saxony. It is postmarked: Camden,
      N.J. | Dec | 1(?) | (?). The address and the text of the note were cut out and
      pasted on the flyleaves of Rolleston's copy of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>. Whitman's signature appears in the lower left corner of the
      address. On the flyleaf below the text Rolleston wrote: "The edition here
      alluded to was published by Osgood &amp; Co. Boston, in 1882. The present volume
      is a reprint of it." The reprint to which Rolleston refers was published by
      David McKay in Philadelphia in 1882. Since, from the end of 1881 through 1882,
      Rolleston lived in Dresden at 29 Lange Strasse, the address of the letter card,
      and in 1883 moved to 28 Terrassen Ufer, 1882 must be the year in which this card
      was written. The month, December, is clearly visible on the postmark, and so is
      "1," the first number of the date. Rolleston's letter of , acknowledges the receipt of Whitman's card of
      December 10, and according to Whitman's Commonplace Book, Whitman sent Rolleston
      "full set loose leaves L of G. with postal card" on December 10, 1882 (Charles
      E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.). The date of this note should therefore be
      December 10, 1882. For Rolleston's letters to Whitman in 1882, see <em>Whitman and Rolleston—A Correspondence</em>, ed. Horst
      Frenz (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1951), 56–70.<a href="#r1">[back]

      the note is cut off: Whitman's signature, pasted on page 29 of Rolleston's copy
      of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, may belong to this note (see Frenz,
      72 n2).<a href="#r2">[back]
