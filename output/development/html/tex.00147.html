   <p>[Walt Whitman referred to Henry Clapp, editor of the <em>Saturday Press</em>, who "wrote more than once to me while I was in Boston, to become the solicitor and
      medium of pecuniary aid from you to him, to support his paper. Such solicitations
      I declined to act upon. He then wrote directly to you—and you advanced him $200. I

   <p id="tex.00147_n2">1. Incomplete letter
      draft.<br><br>This fragment is written on the verso of a poem manuscript,
      "The ball-room was swept and the floor white." The date is apparently
      August, since on , Thayer &amp;
      Eldridge thanked Whitman for his advice about the <em>New-York
         Saturday Press</em> and informed him that the firm had made an offer to
      Clapp to assume financial control on September 1. Thayer &amp; Eldridge
      believed that it could make the journal "pay": "Beside[s] we are deeply
      interested in sustaining any journal that dares in these days of literary
      flunkeyism to be independent, and make the literature of a country what it
      should be." Clapp had suggested to Whitman on , that he might get Thayer &amp; Eldridge to "<em>advance me say one hundred dollars on advertising
         account</em>." On , Clapp was
      "in a state of despair . . . all for the want of a paltry two or three
      hundred dollars" which he needed to bring out the next issue.<a href="#r1">[back]
