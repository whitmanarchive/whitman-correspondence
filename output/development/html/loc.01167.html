      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yesterday on my way up to Olive to see my wife's father, who is near the end of his
      life's journey, I read in the <u>Tribune</u> of the death of Wm
      O'Connor.<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup> 
      
      I
      
       
      was news I had been expecting for some time, yet it was a stunning blow
      for all that I know how keenly you must feel it, &amp; you have
       
      my deepest sympathy. No words come to my pen adequate to express the sense of the
      loss we have we suffered in the death of that chivalrous &amp; eloquent soul. How strange
      that his life has all passed, that I shall see or hear him no more.
   </p>
   
   <p>And it is sad to me to think that he has left behind him no work or book that at all
      expresses the measure of his great powers. What 
      a gift of speech that man had! If you can tell me anything about his last days I
      shall be very glad to hear it. Also where he is buried.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am pretty well, &amp; have been immersed in farm work for the past six weeks. We
      have rented our house to a New York man for 5 months. Julian<sup><a href="#loc.01151_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; I live in the old
      house with a man who works for me, &amp; Ursula<sup><a href="#n0892" id="r3">3</a></sup> boards in Po'Keepsie. I hope this
      great heat for the past few days has not prostrated you. Tell Harry 
      Trauble<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup> to write to me.
   </p>
   
   <p>The wave of orchard bloom has just passed over us &amp; the world has been very
      lovely. Drop me a line my dear friend if you are able to do so.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n2002">1. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.01151_n1">2. Julian Burroughs
      (1878–1954), the only son of John and Ursula Burroughs, later became a
      landscape painter, writer, and photographer.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0892">3. Ursula North Burroughs
      (1836–1917) was John Burroughs's wife. Ursula and John were married on
      September 12, 1857. The couple maintained a small farm overlooking the Hudson
      River in West Park, Ulster County. They adopted a son, Julian, at two months of
      age. It was only later revealed that John himself was the biological father of
      Julian.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
