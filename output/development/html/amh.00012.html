   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

   <p id="amh.00012_n2">2.  In her  letter to Whitman, Grace Ellery
      Channing requested permission "to bring out a Walt Whitman Calendar—of
      extracts from your Leaves of Grass." Although she begged for an immediate
      response, her father, William F. Channing wrote Whitman on , reminding the poet that he had not
      replied. On August 3, 1888, in a letter to Stedman, O'Connor observed: "I worked
      hard to help her to select the gnomons for it—not such an easy matter with
      a poet like Walt" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Despite the aid of
      Stedman, nothing came of the Calendar. For more information on Channing and the
      Calendar, see Joann Krieg,

      Channing and the Whitman Calendar," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly
         Review</em> 12 (Spring 1995), 252–256.<a href="#r2">[back]
