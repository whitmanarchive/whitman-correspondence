      <br></br><br></br>Byron Sutherland, Dear young man,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#nyp.00283_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received your letter of September 12,<sup><a href="#nyp.00283_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; was well pleased to hear from you. 
      I have many times thought of you—for I must tell you, Byron, 
      I retain just the same friendship I formed for you the short time we were together,
      (but intimate,) in 1865.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think, at that time, I was a clerk in the Interior Department. 
      I was dismissed from there—but was appointed by the then Attorney General, 
      Mr. Speed, to a moderate place in his Dep't. I have been in that Dep't. ever since—have
      a pleasant situation—have been promoted—&amp; have now served under four successive Attorney
      Generals.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is rather dull in Washington—but I make out quite comfortably—walk &amp; ride around
      a good deal. Byron, I am still living in the same house, 
      472 M street, near 12th, where you staid with me a little while in 1865—and where
      you would be truly welcome to your old friend if you would come &amp; stop with him again.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing very new or special with me. I have excellent health, 
      eat my rations every time, and am I suppose full as fat and brown and bearded &amp; <em>sassy</em> as ever.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will send you, by same mail with this, a newspaper, with a piece written by 
      a young man, Col. Hinton,<sup><a href="#nyp.00283_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> a friend of mine, some time since, about me, 
      that may interest you—but he plasters it on pretty thick.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As you see by the heading of this letter I am now in New York. 
      Your letter was sent on to me here. I am on furlough, which expires last of October,
      
      when I shall return to Washington. While here I spend much of my time with 
      my dear Mother, in Brooklyn—she is hearty &amp; cheerful, though nearly 73.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My address, for some four weeks to come, will be as at the heading 
      of this letter. After that, at Washington, D. C.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, I believe that is all, this time. Byron, I send you my love &amp; friendship, 
      dear soldier boy—and now that we have found each other again, let us try, 
      as far as may be, to keep together.
      
   </p>

   <p id="nyp.00283_n2">2. Sutherland was now
      preparing to be a teacher at the State Normal School at Edinboro, Pennsylvania.
      He wrote after he had seen reviews of Walt Whitman's poetry in the <em>New Eclectic Magazine</em>, 11 (July 1868), 325–329,
      371–375. One was a translation of Freiligrath's article in the Augsburg
      <em>Allgemeinen Zeitung</em> (Whitman wrote to the reviewer,
      Ferdinand Freiligrath, on ), and
      the other was a reprint of an English review of the Rossetti edition. In the
      same issue of the magazine the editor termed Walt Whitman "a monstrosity."
