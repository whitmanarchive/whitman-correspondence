   </p>
   
   
   <p>At last I find myself able to write to you, having got myself moored in a quiet nook
      after much hurried journeying. When I received your letter with the poems, I was
      staying with a married sister<sup><a href="#loc.05112_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> in the county Wicklow.
      Then my father got very ill &amp; I had to go down &amp; see him (he is all right now.)
      Then business in London, tedious travelling half across Europe, &amp; now my wife and
      I are fixed in a little German valley for the summer. There are mineral springs and
      baths here; she was ordered  to come for her health, which has not been very good
      lately—but there is every likelihood of its mending now. This is a very
      pleasant place—a long, rather narrow valley with low hills, covered with
      pinewood, at each side—at one end of it stands the village of Elster, bowered
      in dense foliage, oak and chestnut; with highroofed houses, a few large hotels, a
      rather grand looking building,—the Bath House—surrounding the mineral
      springs. When you climb to the top of a hill you see leagues on leagues of grass
      country, no mountains, but low undulations with quaintly built villages set in their
      folds, and covered often with dark tracts of pine forest.  There are few visitors here, for
      this is not one of the fashionable watering places; our countrymen &amp; women have
      not found it out and vulgarized it yet. These Germans I admire more and
      more—if they keep their present characteristics, what a nation they will be
      sometime! Their life is simple, friendly, humane, unembarrassed; the poor have
      leisure and use it well, the rich do not strive, (as periodically in England) to "do
      their duty to the lower classes" by subscribing to benevolent schemes &amp;
      inventing elaborate machinery for the reclamation of criminals,—they meet
      their labourers, servants, &amp;c in a perfectly natural manner, as man with man and
      other bonds are established than
      those which unite the payer and the payee. As a nation, high and low, they have
      intelligence, and what is more, spirituality—life is not measured by its
      value in £.s.d.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is much
      democracy among them, socially speaking—politically, none whatever. They
      endure a really oppressive despotism—<u>how</u> oppressive
      foreigners, even aristocratic Germans, can little know—without complaint, or
      resent it only in a petty, spiteful way. And they have an innate dread and respect
      for an <u>official</u>—anyone in a uniform—they
      surround him with something of the divinity that used to hedge kings when
      Shakespeare wrote. They are a people whom I love to mix with. I mean the common
      folk, the others I rarely meet with, for I scarcely see anyone, being buried a good
      deal in Greek and metaphysics, except when I take long walks in the country, which
      I
      do pretty often; sometimes with a  knapsack for a fortnight, wandering
      without definite aim, finding friends, 'eating and sleeping with the earth.'
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In Dublin I came across a man I had heard much of but never seen before, one Standish
      O'Grady, a barrister who drifted into authorship, has written part of a History of
      Ireland, collecting, translating, piecing together, Homeric fashion, old bardic lays
      preserved from pagan times, of Irish heroes and gods. He is going to bring the
      history down to the present day.<sup><a href="#loc.05112_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I met him at Dowden's
      first, often afterwards, &amp; we
      arranged for a walk on the Wicklow mountains, Dowden, O'Grady, two others &amp;
      myself. When the day came only O'Grady and I appeared at the rendezvous, &amp; we
      had a splendid day of it. I never met anyone, I think, whose mind answered so well
      to mine. We had been travelling on parallel roads of thought for some time—now
       we travelled
      together. Each had help to give and each needed
      help; above all we helped each other to <u>realize</u>. I love
      many persons, but him with that nearest, most contented love—him and one
      other. That other is now a schoolmaster in South Africa.<sup><a href="#loc.05112_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      O'Grady in Ireland, I in Saxonland—if we three were together we would tread
      the clouds! I send you some stanzas about my day's walk with O'Grady (I found out
      shortly that he was a lover and disciple of yours, and we talked much of you).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thank you very much for the two poems.<sup><a href="#loc.05112_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I have put them in
      the Passage to India. It was very kind of you to try to get 'Calvin Harlowe'
      published, but I fear it is too rough. I could mend it a good deal. It was written
      quickly, the subject filled me and I hammered out the verses &amp; left them without
      a touch of the file. So too with those I send you—but I don't think I ever
      shall arrive at successful filing.

   <p>This address will find me till October—that of 'Glasshouse, Shinrone, Ireland,' always.
      I hope you are well.
   </p>
   
   <p>I think much might be well done in altering the arrangement of your poems &amp; prose,
      but I like the <u>two</u> vols. [

       mainly, as they are.

      1. These to embalm a day to keep fresh its memory forever.
      <br><br>
      2. Out of the eddying town, out of the bustle and gloom,
      <br>Relaxing the hardset grasp, dismissing knowledge and gain,
      <br>Tossing the world to the winds, wooers of sun and mountain-air,
      <br>Forth we went—thou, bard of Oscar and of the friend of outcasts,
      the divine Cuculain,
      <br>Thou, nourisher of this land with the stalwart life, the blood of her
      heroes dead,
      <br>I, dreamer of dreams, dilletante poet and scholar.
      <br><br>
      3. Keen and clear, a flood of light, the March-wind blows upon the
      Wicklow hills;
      <br>Blows from over the blue Channel, making the white waves leap at the
      sand bank,
      <br>Sings aloft by the granite crags, the tossing heather, the miles of
      moor.
      <br><br>
      4. On thee we soared upborne, on paths the eagles never knew.
      <br>Far and wide the horizon fled before our gaze.
      <br>Clearly, one instant, the Real World sprang into view, and vanished like
      a dream again—
      
      
      
      
      <br>And again the same hills and rocks, again the Sky, again the blue Channel
      with white waves leaping;
      <br>But now, O Sea and Sky and impassive Earth, your secret is told, you can
      mock us no longer;
      <br>Silent and mystic Nature! for once you have unmask'd to us.
      <br><br>
      5. —And ever as we went, there hover'd near us another spirit,
      sometimes unseen, oftener between us, holding a hand of each,
      <br>For the power of the mountains was on us that day, and the power of the
      Sea, and of Walt Whitman, poet of comrades.
      <br><br>
      6. Farewell, bright Day, our way through thee is ended.
      <br>Other suns shall shine for us and other skies be fair,
      <br>But thy sun and thy sky our eyes shall see no more.
      <br><br>
      7. Yet do we not hold thee in our souls, and shall we not eternally?
      <br>All that thou gavest us, assuredly we shall keep for ever,
      <br>Day, that poured on us the power of the mountains, and the power of the
      Sea, and of Walt Whitman, poet of comrades.

   <p id="loc.05112_n1">1. Rolleston's only
      sister—to whom he was very devoted—was married to Henry Truell of
      Clonmannon, County Wicklow.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05112_n2">2. The historical writings of
      Standish O'Grady (1846–1928) were an inspiration to the great Irish
      Literary Revival. He has often been referred to as the father of this movement.
      Between 1878 and 1880, he published the two volumes of <em>History
         of Ireland: Heroic Period</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05112_n3">3. In a letter to Horst Frenz
      of August 13, 1950, Captain C. H. Rolleston wrote: "I do not think there can be
      any doubt that my Father's schoolmaster friend was H. B. Cotterill, M.A., who
      was later in Germany and was the author of a version of Homer's Odyssey in
      English hexameters."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05112_n4">4. One of the poems is
      probably "To the Man-of-War-Bird" referred to in the letter from Rolleston to
      Whitman, .<a href="#r4">[back]
