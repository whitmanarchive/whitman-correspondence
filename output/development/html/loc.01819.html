      <br xmlns="" class="opener">October 19, 1865.
      
      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The article you sent Nelly<sup><a href="#loc.01819_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> from the London Leader is in
      my possession. Good! I shall incorporate it. Part of it is very fine.
   </p>
   
   <p>I wonder if young William Allingham wrote it.<sup><a href="#loc.01819_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> The Leader
      is the paper he is on. He is a poet, you remember—one of the most promising of
      the young British choir. He is an Irishman and a reverent lover of Emerson's genius. I
      shouldn't wonder if he wrote this critique.
   </p>
   
   <p>Anyhow it's good and I shall put a great deal of it in.</p>
   
   <p>If, ever since I have been here, I had not had the worst cold I ever had in my
      life—a cold which has made me really sick and spoiled the pleasure of my
      visit—I should doubtless have ere this sent off the <u>MS</u> to Curtis.<sup><a href="#loc.01819_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup> It will probably go soon. It is
      just as well and even better that I have delayed it, for in the first place it will be enriched with
      this quotation and besides you will like it better by the excision of nearly all the
      personality, new light having come to me on this point as time has passed and the
      sweet country air and relief from labor cleared and refreshed my poor boiled
      brains.
   </p>
   
   <p>On my way through New York I enquired at <u>Harpers</u> for Curtis
      and found he was out of town. So I brought the <u>MS</u> with me
      up here. Then came Curtis' answer; of which I send you a copy that you may see how true
      the reply this splendid gentleman and noble heart sends back to my call.
   </p>
   
   <p>I really did not expect so much from Curtis. I relied on his literary chivalry, but
      did not look for the rest. As George would say, he has "elements."
   </p>
   
   <p>I have written to him saying that I want him to endeavor to find me a publisher and
      mentioning Hurd &amp; Houghton: also saying that in a few days I shall send him the
      <u>MS</u>.
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish you could come up
      here. The landscape is exquisite. Fields, farms, the quiet rustic town, the gorgeous
      foliage, the Temple and Peterboro' hills enclosing all. And then, drive out a few
      miles and lo! Monadnoc! O Walt, what a sight! A purple breadth of mountain, spreading
      calm in sleepy light and filling the landscape with grandeur. It is the finest
      mountain I have seen. Its characteristic is breadth.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am staying here at the
      house of Miss Jenny Bullard, a friend of whom I believe I have spoken to you.<sup><a href="#loc.01819_n6" id="r4">4</a></sup> I wish you knew her. You would like her. She is handsome,
      bountiful, generous, cordial, strong, careless, laughing, large, regardless of dress
      or personal appearance, and appreciates or likes <u>Leaves of
         Grass</u>. The first thing she read in the book was <u>Enfans
         d'Adam</u>, which she cordially liked and wondered how anyone could mistake its
      atmosphere and purport. She is a very particular friend of mine. I wish you knew her. She told me
      today that she wanted me to invite you to come up here for a few days before I go,
      but I said I wouldn't because I knew you wouldn't come.
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall probably leave here about the twenty fifth and go to Boston. Then, home.</p>
   
   <p>Spite of dear friends and respite from the treadmill and the superb October scenery,
      I have had considerably of a bad time, chiefly owing to the horrible cold I have had
      and the weary state I
      have been in. But I am better now and the world looks brighter.
   </p>
   
   <p>Now I hope to be able to announce to you that the <u>MS</u> has a
      publisher. But oh, Walt, the literary shortcomings of it oppress me. It is not the
      thing that should be said of your book—not the thing that it is in even me to
      say,—as I feel.—However.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good bye. I will write you again.</p>

      <br></br><br></br>My dear O'Connor:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Here, up among the Autumn hills, I get your interesting letter of the 20th and you
      may be very sure that I will do all I can to redress the wrong of which you
      speak.
   </p>
   
   <p>The task you undertake is not easy, as you know. The public sympathy will be with
      the
      Secretary for removing a man who will be considered an obscene author and a free
      lover. But your hearty vindication of free letters will not be the less welcome to all liberal men.
   </p>
   
   <p>Personally I do not know Whitman; and while his "Leaves of Grass" impressed me less
      than it impressed many better men than I, I have never heard anything of him but what
      was noble nor believed anything of him but what was honorable. That a man should be
      expelled from Office and held up to public contumely, because of an honest book which
      no candid mind can truly regard as hurtful to public morality, 
      <u>is</u> an offence which demands exposure and censure.
   </p>
   
   <p>I know Carleton but he has several times asked of me favors which I could not grant
      and I do not believe your offer would be strengthened if made through me.<sup><a href="#loc.01819_n7" id="r5">5</a></sup> If you think otherwise, I shall most cheerfully go to
      him,—but would it not be better for you to write to him and refer him to me,
      saying, if you choose, that you had asked me to call upon him? Think of it and let
      me
      know.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It was very pleasant to see your comely chirography again, altho' I wish I could
      think of you as having had some vacation. We have been here for two months, far from
      railroads, telegraphs and gossip and are just going home. My wife returns your
      friendly remembrance and yours, I hope, has not forgotten me. I should be glad, too,
      if I thought you felt as cheerfully as I feel at the real gain in the Good Fight made
      by the war. Andy may Tylerize, but the country will not. The wave may be lower, but
      the tide is rising.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good bye. Let me hear as soon as you will. You know how gladly I shall serve you and how
      truly I am
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived with
      William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later John
      Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington years.
      William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor often complained about the
      various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his death. However, his
      government work was relieved by the presence of Whitman, whom he was to love and
      venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
      vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
      pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
      important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
      those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
      O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
      sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
      first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910], 513). For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see Deshae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01819_n3">1. O'Connor refers to a <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1860/anc.00041.html">review of Whitman's work</a> from the <em>London
         Leader</em>, which Whitman had sent to Ellen O'Connor in his letter of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01819_n4">2. The poet William Allingham
      was author of <em>Poems</em> (London: Chapman and Hall, 1850), <em>Day and Night Songs</em> (London: George Routledge &amp; Co.,
      1854), and <em>Lawrence Bloomfield in Ireland</em> (London:
      Macmillan and Co., 1864).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01819_n5">3. George William Curtis was
      editor of <em>Harper's New Monthly Magazine</em>. O'Connor had
      requested Curtis's advice in seeking a publisher for <em>The Good
         Gray Poet</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01819_n6">4. Whitman mentions the "Case
      of Jenny Bullard" in a notebook entry alongside a warning to himself to
      "Remember Fred Vaughn." Meditating on his relationship with Peter Doyle, Whitman
      laments "this diseased, feverish disproportionate adhesiveness" (Edward F.
      Grier, ed., <em>Notes and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–84], 2:890). Aside from O'Connor's
      letter, Whitman's notebook entry is the only other reference to Bullard in the
      poet's papers. Bullard's full name was Sarah Jane Wollstonecraft Bullard. She
      was born in Boston September 11, 1828 and died in New Ipwich October 13, 1904.
      Bullard never married and is said to have lived with two women.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01819_n7">5. Curtis refers to New York
      publisher George Carleton. In 1867 Carleton would pass on an opportunity to
      publish a new edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Within about a
      month, Carleton "had the distinction of turning down both <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and Mark Twain's first book"; later dubbed himself
      "the prize ass of the nineteenth century" (Justin Kaplan, <em>Walt
         Whitman: A Life</em> [New York: Simon and Schuster, 1980], 320).<a href="#r5">[back]
