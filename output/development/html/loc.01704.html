      <br></br>Gentlemen:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The <em>Weekly Tribune</em> of 21st prints the Harvest Carol on its last page, but leaves out several connecting
      verses indispensable to the <em>ensemble</em> of the piece, &amp; mangling it pretty badly in several ways. This is rather too much
      of a liberty. Would it be worth while to attempt a correction—asking the <em>Tribune</em> folk to insert in their columns an item like the enclosed slip—for instance?—As presented
      by them, the Carol is very much like one of those toy caoutchouc faces, with the mouth
      &amp; nose utterly squeezed out—They ought by good rights to print it again in full, from
      the correct version in the <em>Galaxy</em>—but I suppose that could not be done.<sup><a href="#loc.01704_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I only write suggestively, leaving it to you to decide whether it is necessary to
      take any action at all in the matter.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This letter is not to be given, or alluded to, in publication should there be any.</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01704_n1">1. William Conant Church
      (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
      York newspapers until he founded the <em>Army and Navy
         Journal</em> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
      he established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. Financial control of
      the <em>Galaxy</em> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
      was absorbed by the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1878. William
      published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
      Francis wrote for the New York <em>Sun</em> the unsigned piece
      "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." See Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the
      <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952),
      332–350; Donald N. Bigelow, <em>William Conant Church
         &amp;</em> "The Army and Navy Journal" (New York: Columbia University Press,
      1952); J. R. Pearson, Jr., "Story of a Magazine: New York's <em>Galaxy</em>, 1866–1878," <em>Bulletin of the New York
         Public Library</em>, 61 (1957), 217–237, 281–302.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.01704_n2">2. John C. Broderick, who
      printed this letter, explains the situation clearly. "A Carol of Harvest, for
      1867," which was to appear in the <em>Galaxy</em> in September
      1867, was printed in abbreviated form in the New York <em>Weekly
         Tribune</em> on August 21, 1867; sections five to ten and half of section
      eleven were omitted. The <em>Weekly Tribune</em> observed on
      August 28, 1867: "Some of Mr. Walt Whitman's friends complain of us for
      publishing only a part of his Harvest Carol in the last number of <em>The Weekly Tribune</em>. We did not print the whole, first
      because it was too long, and secondly because it was not good enough. Anybody
      who wants the rest will find it in the <em>Galaxy</em>." The poem
      was later retitled "The Return of the Heroes." See also Whitman's , ,
      and  letters to William C. Church
      and Francis P. Church.<a href="#r2">[back]
