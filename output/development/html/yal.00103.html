   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Redpath
      (1833–1891) was the author of <em>The Public Life of Capt.
         John Brown</em> (Boston: Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the
      <em>New York Tribune</em> during the war, the originator of
      the "Lyceum" lectures, and editor of the <em>North American
         Review</em> in 1886. He met Whitman in Boston in 1860 (Thomas Biggs Harned
      Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #90) and remained
      an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, ed. Sculley Bradley (New York: Rowman and Littlefield,
      1961), 3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp."
      See also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins,
      1926).
