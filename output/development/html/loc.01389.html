   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.01389_n1">1. This postal card is
      addressed: Mrs: Mary W Costelloe | 40 Grosvenor Road | Westminster Embankment |
      London England. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | Jun 14 | 8 PM | 89.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01389_n2">3. Whitman almost always
      sent Mary Costelloe's letters to Bucke.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03012_n1">4. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy of .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00553_n3">5. Alys Smith (1867–1951)
      was Mary's sister. She would eventually marry the philosopher Bertrand
      Russell.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4979">6. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01389_n3">7. Whitman is referring to
      Costelloe's two daughters. Rachel Pearsall Conn Costelloe (1887–1940) was
      Mary's first daughter. Rachel ("Ray") eventually married Oliver Strachey
      (brother of biographer Lytton Strachey) and was a writer and women's suffrage
      activist who ran for a seat in the British parliament soon after women were
      granted the right to vote. Karin Stephen (née Catherine Elizabeth
      Costelloe) (1889–1953) was Mary's second daughter. She would become a
      British psychoanalyst and psychologist, and the wife of Adrian Stephen (psychoanalyst
      and prominent member of the 
      Bloomsbury Group, and brother of Virginia Woolf).<a href="#r7">[back]
