   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04776_n1">1. This letter dates to
      either July 31 or August 7, 1872. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter
      Wednesday, and the marking in the upper right margin of the first page may
      be the time of the day, "abt 6." That mark, however, is unreliable because
      it is illegible. Edwin Haviland Miller did not note this summer 1872 letter
      (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:367).<br><br>
      When requesting a two-week extension of his summer leave, Walt Whitman
      planned to return to the office of the attorney general on July 25, 1872
      (see his  letter to Webster
      Elmes). According to Louisa's letter, a packet service came to gather Walt's
      trunk just after he departed for Washington, D.C. However, Louisa at the
      close of the letter seems to expect that Walt would visit soon. He planned
      to visit on August 31, 1872 (see his  letter to Louisa). If Walt returned to
      Washington as planned on July 25, this letter probably dates to the
      following Wednesday, July 31, 1872. But since Louisa expected Walt to visit
      again shortly after her arrival in Camden, this letter may date a week
      later, to August 7, 1872.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04776_n2">2. Walt Whitman's July 30 or
      August 6, 1872 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant (Walt Whitman,
      <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77], 2:362).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04776_n5">3. Walt Whitman probably
      departed Brooklyn on July 23 or 24, 1872. Upon requesting a two-week extension
      of his summer leave, he planned to return to the office of the attorney general
      on July 25, 1872 (see his  letter to
      Webster Elmes).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">4. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04776_n7">5. The phrase "slate to
      newmans" is unclear. Perhaps the delivery service had a regular pickup that
      included a nearby grocery, John Newman at 381 Myrtle (<em>Brooklyn
         Directory</em> [1870]).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04776_n8">6. It is not known what Walt
      Whitman sent to the office of the <em>New York Herald</em>
      (1840–1920) in late July or early August 1872. The newspaper had recently
      published a poem by Whitman for the first time, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00090.html">"As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free."</a> For more on James Gordon
      Bennett's <em>New York Herald</em> and the many poems by Whitman
      that were published in the paper, see ."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04776_n25">7. The high temperatures in
      Brooklyn on July 30 and July 31, 1872, were 89°F (31.7°C) and 87°F (30.5°C). The
      high temperatures on August 6 and August 7, 1872, were 86°F (30°C) and 81.5°F
      (27.5°C). See "Heat Record," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, July
      30, 1872, July 31, 1872, August 6, 1872, August 7, 1872.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n6">8. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04776_n9">9. James "Jimmy" Whitman was
      the older son of Walt Whitman's deceased brother Andrew Jackson Whitman
      (1827–1863) and his wife Nancy McClure. Nancy released her son Jimmy to
      the care of George Washington Whitman and Louisa Orr in late 1871 (see Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to
      Walt). For Andrew's wife and children, see Jerome M. Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> (Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975), 12–14.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04776_n10">10. George "Georgy" Whitman was
      the younger son of Walt Whitman's deceased brother Andrew Jackson Whitman
      (1827–1863) and his wife Nancy McClure. Though the Whitmans as early as
      spring 1868 sought actively to remove Nancy McClure's children from her care and
      place them in an orphan asylum, Nancy first indicated her willingness to release
      Georgy into their care in late 1871 (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt). Georgy's older
      brother Jimmy was placed into the care of George Washington Whitman and wife
      Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman for a time, but this letter seems to indicate that
      Georgy still remained with his mother. The cause of his death is not known, but
      Georgy Whitman was killed in October 1872 (see Manahatta Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04776_n12">11. The article that Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman read on the Shakers, presumably in a July 1872 issue of the <em>New York Sun</em>, has not been identified. The Shakers, the
      United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Coming, originated in
      mid-eighteenth century England by separating from the Quakers. The movement was
      concentrated in New England states, and the Shakers practiced communal worship
      and emphasized communal property ownership. The Shakers practiced formal
      equality between male and female members. The movement reached a peak membership
      of six thousand in the late 1840s, and it thereafter went into gradual decline
      (Lawrence Foster, "Shakers," <em>Encyclopedia of Religions</em>
      [Detroit: Macmillan Reference, 2005]).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04776_n14">12. Walt Whitman visited Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman in Camden, New Jersey, at the end of August, shortly after
      her move. See his  letter
      to Louisa.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n4">13. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r13">[back]
