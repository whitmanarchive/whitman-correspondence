   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00462_n10">1. The date "September 21" is
      in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand and Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year
      1865. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:377). Since Louisa was in Burlington, Vermont—where she
      traveled on September 4, 1865 and returned on October 17, 1865—at the time
      of this letter, the letter dates to September 21, 1865.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00462_n1">2. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., resided in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles L.
      Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. The relationship between Hannah
      and Charles was difficult and marred with quarrels and disease. Charles Heyde
      was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. Louisa during her visit was alternately alarmed by and resigned to the
      conflict between Hannah and Charles, writing to her son Walt Whitman
      reassuringly in her  letter that
      she found her daughter "quite as well and better than i expected," but
      alarmingly in her  letter that
      "there was quite a blow out of coarse i did not participate in the
      scrap."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">3. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00462_n7">6. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      resided in Burlington, Vermont, not "birmingham" as Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      wrote here. Though below she wrote the correct name "Burlington,"she erred also
      in her  letter from Burlington
      and, after her return to Brooklyn, in her  letter. Burlington, Vermont is on Lake Champlain, across from
      Port Kent, New York. Vermont has no city or town named "Birmingham."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00462_n5">7. Jesse Whitman
      (1818–1870) was the first-born son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr. He suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence
      for several years before he was committed to an asylum. This letter dates to a
      little less than a year after Walt Whitman committed Jesse to Kings County
      Lunatic Asylum in Brooklyn, where he remained until his death on death on March
      21, 1870 (see E. Warner's  letter to
      Walt). For a short biography of Jesse, see Robert Roper, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.01011.pdf">"Jesse Whitman, Seafarer,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 26:1 (2008),
      35–41.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00462_n9">8. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      "v" in "very" has a tail and so resembles the letter "y."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00462_n15">9. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      arrived in Burlington on September 4, 1865, and she returned to Brooklyn six
      weeks later, on October 17. Louisa wrote again from Burlington on  and encouraged Walt Whitman to
      visit Hannah because "i dont think i can stay a very great while longer." Walt,
      from Brooklyn, wrote to Ellen M. O'Connor on : "mother arrived home last Tuesday."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00462_n11">10. Walt Whitman's September
      8?, 1865 letter, in which he requested papers, possibly related to <em>Drum-Taps</em> (1865), is not extant (see Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman's  letter to
      Walt, n. 1). Jeff reported that he had "sent the bundle." <a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00462_n4">11. The "old lady" is Juliet
      Grayson, who with husband Edward B. Grayson took boarders at 468 M Street South,
      where Walt Whitman lived between late January 1865 and at least June 1866. The
      Graysons were Southern sympathizers with a son in the Confederate Army. Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman also named Juliet Grayson the "old lady" in her  letter to Walt.<a href="#r11">[back]
