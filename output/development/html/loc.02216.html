      <br></br><br></br>Dear W. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nearly a month ago I sent you a request to vote (as a member of <u>The Critic's</u> Academy of Forty Immortals) for nine successors to the
      members deceased since our leaders elected the Forty in 1884. I sent a list of about
      65 unsuccessful candidates (or rather nominees) who were voted for at that time, +
      asked you to pick out nine of them or to name nine others if you preferred. Nearly
      all the
      "Academicians" have sent in their votes; but I don't want to announce the result of
      the thing till I hear from you. <u>If you have lost the printed
         slip, I can send you another.</u> We shall not tell how any individual voted,
      but only how they all voted—the net result. I hope you'll not disappoint
      us.
   </p>

      Sincerely yours,
      <br></br>J. B. Gilder
