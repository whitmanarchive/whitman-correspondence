   <p>It is 2.20 P.M. I am writing at the desk in my office. It is so dark that I almost
      need the gas to see to write. Outside the rain pours down, the sky is a dark leaden
      gray. This kind of thing has gone on for about two weeks now and is getting a little
      monotonous. The bundle of ad's<sup><a href="#loc.07327_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> came this morning, I shall send them to friends as I
      write. Do you read R.L. Stevenson<sup><a href="#n7509" id="r3">3</a></sup>? If so get the "Master of Ballantrae,"<sup><a href="#loc.07327_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> I am in the
      middle of it, it is first rate—a regular Xmas story lots of adventure and
      old=fashioned hair breadth escapes. Willy Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r5">5</a></sup> is not home yet
      and no word of him, I expect him almost every train now. Mrs. B<sup><a href="#n4273" id="r6">6</a></sup> is still in
      Detroit, will probably return home tomorrow. We are having 4 evenings a week
      amusements at the Asylum—one lecture each week among them. It keeps us all
      going I am in the middle of getting new scenery for our new amusement hall. When it
      is done we shall have as good a drop curtain and as good scenery as in the Opera
      House in London here! Have just heard from Willy Gurd (mail just in) he will not be
      home to Xmas, is in N.Y. submitting the meter to the N.Y. gas co. I do not know what
      he expects to come of this—he will likely be home before New Years

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07327_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey U.S.A. It is postmarked:
      London | AM | DE 21 | 89 | Canada; N.Y. | 12-22-89 | 10 AM | [illegible]; Camden, N.J. | Dec 23 | 6AM

   <p id="loc.07327_n2">2. On , Whitman sent Bucke four copies of
      an advertising circular for <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em>,
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and <em>Portraits from
         Life</em>. The advertisement appeared in Traubel's <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1889);
      a facsimile of Whitman's draft of the circular appears in Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.53.html">Thursday, May 30, 1889</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n7509">3. Robert Louis Stevenson
      (1850–1894), a Scottish-born author now mainly known for his works <em>Treasure Island</em> and <em>The Strange Case of
         Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em>, was also an admirer of Whitman (Clare Harman,
      <em> Robert Louis Stevenson: A Biography</em> [London: Harper
      Collins Publishers, 2005]).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07327_n3">4. Stevenson's <em>The Master of Ballantrae</em> focused on two brothers and
      Scottish noblemen during the 1745 rebellion, when Charles Edward Stuart
      attempted to regain the British throne for his father, James Francis Edward
      Stuart. It was published in 1889.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4284">5. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
