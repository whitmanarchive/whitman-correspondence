   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843â€“1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01881_n1">1. This letter was cut into
      pieces and pasted back together. On the back Whitman drafted a letter to Edwin
      Einstein dated .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0433">2. Mr. and Mrs. Michael Nash were Washington friends to
      whom Whitman referred frequently in his letters to Peter Doyle and with whom he
      often stayed when he visited Washington. Michael Nash was an old resident of the
      city; Whitman's , letter to Doyle
      mentioned a speech Nash gave to the Oldest Inhabitants' Association.<a href="#r2">[back]
