      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>Your kind remembrance of me on your birthday, &amp; the gifts of copies of your new
      edition of <u>Leaves of Grass</u><sup><a href="#n7007" id="r1">1</a></sup> have given me the greatest
      pleasure. I have to thank you also for <u>November Boughs</u>,<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r2">2</a></sup> a
      most welcome gift, which reached me after some delay through Mr Lewis Fry<sup><a href="#n4294" id="r3">3</a></sup> of Bristol. But more even than your kind thought of me it
      rejoices me to know that you are somewhat better in health, &amp; that the love &amp; honour
      due to you by your own country has come to you—all in good time. I wrote a few lines to a
      friend of yours on the occasion of your 70th birthday which I believe will be
      printed in a pamphlet.<sup><a href="#loc.01502_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> But I want also, at least in fancy, to reach my hand across
      the sea, &amp; to take your hand, &amp; to tell you that your friendship is a good
      possession for me. I think of seventy years as quite the vestibule of age, because my own father is
      rigorous, at least in mind, now in his ninetieth year. And the recent songs you have
      sung have only the maturity &amp; flavour of well-ripened fruit, growing on a sound-timbered
      tree. At
      eighty perhaps you may have even a happier birthday, with yet more new friends &amp;
      still the old ones.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n7007">1. Whitman probably sent Dowden a copy
      of the 1889 special issue of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, issued in
      honor of Whitman's 70th birthday. Only 300 copies were printed, and Whitman
      signed the title page of each one. For more information on the book, see Ed
      Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a></em>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">2. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4294">3. Lewis Fry (1832–1921) was a
      British lawyer and Liberal Unionist politician who served as a Member of
      Parliament for Bristol for three terms between 1878 and 1900.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01502_n1">4. Dowden is referring to the
      letter that he wrote regarding Whitman's birthday and the growth of his fame.
      The letter was printed, along with numerous other notes and addresses honoring
      Whitman on the occasion of his 70th birthday, in <em>Camden's
         Compliment to Walt Whitman: May 31, 1889: Notes, Addresses, Letters,
         Telegrams</em>, ed. Horace L. Traubel (Philadelphia: David McKay),
