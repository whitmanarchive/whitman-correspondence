      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been waiting all this time for the right mood and the right day to send a
      letter to you, but I must not wait any longer now, though there is a fog outside
      &amp; a fog or something of the sort in my head. Since coming back here from the
      country three weeks ago, there has been such a lot to do that I have got out of touch
      with the natural order &amp; spirit of things, &amp; these London fogs are enough
      to make the
      animal in one turn absolute coward. With sunlight or a flying wind or a good rain
      I
      am happy enough, but I cannot stand these smoke-soiled days. They make me feel
      stupid &amp; wicked.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But I ought not to grumble like this, &amp; I won't any more. For I had a splendid
      ten weeks of autumn in Wales &amp; the West of England. In North Wales—at a
      place called Llwyngwril, a primitive little village, quite away from town-ways &amp;
      fashions, I stayed for four weeks with my dear friend Herbert Horne at a farm-house
      close to the sea-shore. There we bathed &amp; mountaineered &amp; drank our fill of
      mountain wind &amp; sunshine, &amp; I rambled off once right round by Snowdon to
      Carnarvon, where the remnant of the Cymric races were holding their Eisteddfod.
      There is a wonderful old castle at Carnarvon, &amp; within its walls on a bright
      September morning it impressed me strangely (being half Cymric in blood myself) to
      see those old grey-bearded, venerable fellows, in their mystic circle, uttering
      those wonderful Druidic prayers (which are purely theistic) &amp; eloquently
      orating in a way utterly unlike our English fashion; for the Welsh orators make
      their voices almost sing sometimes, &amp; their language is much more plastic &amp;
      various, like a more southern tongue. Their improvised
      harp-songs,—Penillion-singing, are very striking too,—quaint, wild
      tunes that would delight you, I am sure, so full as they are of natural music &amp;
      feeling. Unhappily I don't know enough of the language to understand all, but I heard
      &amp; saw enough to make me feel that there was a great deal of tremendous value
      for our Saxon materialistic minds in the spirit of imaginative idealism that underlies the Cymric
      expression of life, now as in the past. There is something to me greatly inspiring
      to think of the international elements, Celtic, Cymric, Sclavonic, Gallic, that our
      Saxon stock must assimilate to itself to new ends of human growth &amp; perfection as
      time goes by. And for this of course America is the grand field of
      development!
   </p>
   
   <p>A few days back W. S. Kennedy's<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r2">2</a></sup> new book about you arrived here
      from Chatto &amp; Windus, &amp; in reading it &amp; looking at relative passages in
      "Specimen Days" &amp; "Leaves of Grass," the thought of the American future has filled
      me with a new impetus. But I must not dwell upon this now, as there
      are other things to settle. I must just say about Kennedy's book, however, that I
      have every hope of being able to place it satisfactorily with some publisher. I am
      waiting now to hear from Fred. Wilson, of W. &amp; McCormick &amp; you may be sure I
      will do all I can for the book. There is a great deal in it about L. of G. &amp;
      about yourself intimately, which I find unspeakably stimulative &amp; tonic. It will
      cause something like a sensation when it appears,—amongst those who know L. of
      G. at any rate. Having it in my drawer or on the table as I write, it makes me feel
      as if you yourself had been in the room, bringing health &amp; virile stimulus.
   </p>
   
   <p>This brings me to "Specimen Days" which I am proud to think will appear in the Camelot
      series. Thanks very many for letting me have it! I will get as much as I can out of
      the publishers; for as Walter Scott is one of the largest railway contractors, as
      well as a publisher, &amp; well stocked with money, I have no scruple on that score.
      It is not easy in any case to get much out of him, unfortunately. For my own sake,
      as well as yours, I wish it were! As for cutting the book down, it seems wicked to
      think of it; but it is really rather longer than they find it pays to give for a shilling,
      &amp; if you will do the emendation yourself, one may feel less sore about it.
      Including the appendix (which is of course in smaller type) there are about 70
      pages more than the publishers like to have in the Camelot volumes, so if you will
      revise the book to make it about 300 pages, it will answer capitally. Is
      it too much to ask you for a few fresh words of introduction as well, addressed to
      the English reader?
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope we shall soon be ready now too to print the 2nd Edn
      of the selected Leaves of Grass. In the paper you sent me I noticed your admonition
      about tampering with your full expression in them, &amp; have thought over it very
      seriously, besides asking Dr Bucke's opinion about issuing a 2nd Edn at
      all of my little book. He strongly advises the re-issue, however, looking at it, as
      I
      do, as an important makeshift which will help the perfect presentment to a hearing
      presently. He advises too the inclusion of "The Song of Myself" instead of some of
      the other poems. Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r3">3</a></sup> (whom I expect to see this
      evening) has promised me a new portrait too.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      yours, with great love,
      <br></br>Ernest Rhys
      
   </p>
    
   
   <p>Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> has hospitably pressed me to go &amp; see him next summer,
      holding out the inducement of your being at his place. Ah, how I should like it to
      be possible!
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>I ought<sup><a href="#loc.03315_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> to have said with regard to "Specimen Days"
      &amp; the Camelot requirements, that the vol. of King Arthur contains a great deal
      more than the publishers can really afford to give. The first vol. they looked upon
      as a sort of pilot for the rest, &amp; put an extra amount in accordingly.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <p id="n3039">2. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
