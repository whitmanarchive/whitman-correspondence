      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I write you these lines from a little village two mile's from [
      <span class="unclear">Weimar?</span>]
      , where I have visited the Tombs of [
      <span class="unclear">Goethe?</span>]
       and [
      <span class="unclear">Schiller?</span>]
       and felt all the great [
      <span class="unclear">recollection awaken?</span>]
      . I have had a great deal of [
      <span class="unclear">fulsome?</span>]
       labors this spring and now I am seeking refreshment between the pines of [
      <span class="unclear">Thüringerwald?</span>]
      , living among a very amiable and [
      <span class="unclear">childlike?</span>]
       population. The German' dont understand their
      
      
      
      deeds [
      <span class="unclear">after?</span>]
       all. [
      <span class="unclear">Prussen?</span>]
       do the iron crest of this huge and soft German body; but the body is so soft indeed,
      that one should think, there were no bones in it.
   </p>
   
   <p>If the language did not impact my fancy and [illegible]  I should have a great deal to tell you. Let these lines shortly tell you, that you
      have been remembered in the metropole of German geniuses, and send some lines to the
      old [illegible] Ils with infomaation of your state of health.
   </p>
