      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother Walt,
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your paper received and your postal,<sup><a href="#n0368b" id="r1">1</a></sup> and I have been wanting to write all the week,
      but busy as usual, Today is perfectly lovely we had a refreshing rain on Friday and
      the streets look clean, and every thing bright 
      Geo<sup><a href="#n0700" id="r2">2</a></sup> is busy as ever, but we generally have an hours or so drive in the evening, and I
      come home with a good appetite so it must do me good. Last week while I was at
      market Ida Johnson<sup><a href="#n1058" id="r3">3</a></sup> must have been here, Ed<sup><a href="#n1047" id="r4">4</a></sup> went to the door and he said it was Miss
      Johnson, have you heard from any of them? Did you see the account of the large fire
      in the southern part of Phila, a Planing mill and lumber yard and 50 [
      <span class="unclear">houses?</span>]
      . The Planing mill was Will
      Nices the cousin that comes here a good deal, Walt I think you
      have heard me speak of the child that sister [
      <span class="unclear">Kate?</span>]
       left at her death, she has always been with her 
      fathers
      
       mother, but about a month ago, her grandmother died and we have taken
      Alice, she is nine years old, and a very good disposition, I took her feeling the
      care very much, for I really knew so little about her, only seeing her about twice
      a
      year but we do not find her any trouble to manage, indeed have been quite surprised
      to see how she fits right into our household ways, she is quiet, and seems perfectly
      contented with Tip for a
      companion, he appears to love her dearly, and they are always together, Alice has
      only been here since last Wednesday, so of course this is only a short experience.
      The
      [
      <span class="unclear">Perks?</span>]
       and the
      Elversons are away, Mrs Berry and family think of going soon. Mrs Berry
      says she misses seeing you very much getting on and off the cars, and wishes to be
      remembered to you. You will miss the fire crackers and noise of the fourth in Canada
      a lucky miss
      
      I always dread the noise. I suppose you are having a good time, and keeping well,
      we all send love.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0368b">1. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0700">2. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1058">3. Ida was the daughter of Colonel
      John R. Johnston, the artist, whose home Walt Whitman visited almost every
      Sunday evening.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1047">4. Edward Whitman (1835–1892),
      called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for significant physical and
      mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his mother until her death.
      George Whitman and his wife Louisa Orr Haslam cared for Eddy after Louisa's
      death, with financial support from Walt Whitman. For more information on Edward,
      see Randall Waldron, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_221.html">Whitman, Edward (1835–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
