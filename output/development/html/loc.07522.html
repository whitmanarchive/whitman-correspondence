   <p>Good breakfast at 9½ of chocolate, toasted Graham bread &amp; broil'd chicken
      — enjoy'd all. Have rec'd a nice letter this mn'g f'm Mary Costelloe,<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> return'd to London city—all well—Pearsall
      S[mith]<sup><a href="#loc.01350_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> well as formerly, (one eye sight however
      quite quench'd)—Rec'd also an acc't (in Pall Mall Gaz: Oct: 28) of a visit to
      me f'm the good fellow, Mr Summers, M P,<sup><a href="#n4299" id="r4">4</a></sup> I believe mention'd to
      you in letter months ago<sup><a href="#loc.07522_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I will send the acc't to
      you—the two paper notices Boston <em>Transcript</em> &amp; in
      the Phil: <em>Bulletin</em>, (of N B,)<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r6">6</a></sup> must have now reach'd
      you—they were sent.
   </p>
   
   <p>Am pretty well, considering, but laggard &amp; a dull headache most of the
      time—partial bowel action this forenoon—I don't get out of my room at
      all—the 6th month now—Mr Musgrove<sup><a href="#loc.07541_n2" id="r7">7</a></sup> is kind
      active &amp; considerate all through—dull, darkish, damp here to day—I
      sit here the same, the sash a little open'd—very moderate—
   </p>
   
   <p><em>Sunday noon</em> Nov: 4—Bright, sunny, quiet day—am
      feeling ab't my easiest—fair bowel movement—the big book<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r8">8</a></sup> gets
      on—title page has been made of a big medallion profile of me, (lettering on
      it)—suits me—am thinking (composing it now) of a short concluding note
      at end—will see how I can get it in shape—

      Corning<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r10">10</a></sup> have just call'd &amp; spent a short half hour (I
      don't know but I find myself <em>talking more</em> than I used
      to—talking perhaps more than ever)—I enclose you several letters (I send
      them as a foil, your duties &amp; works there must be dry)—if you don't feel
      to read them, put it off for a better season, or put it aside altogether—I
      suppose Edward Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r11">11</a></sup> will be here to-morrow—Mr M,<sup><a href="#loc.07239_n2" id="r12">12</a></sup> my
      present nurse, is sort o' <em>vexed</em> ab't it all—he is a
      good fellow too, &amp; I am almost glum ab't his going—I liked him
      well—Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r13">13</a></sup> did not, &amp; has not—H remains
      &amp; is perfectly faithful &amp; I depend on him more than words could
      describe—y'r letter came last evn'g.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">2. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina

      (1853–1893) was a member of the British Parliament, junior whip of the
      Liberal Party, and strong proponent of Irish home rule. He visited Whitman on
      September 26, 1888. His account of the visit was published in <em>The Pall Mall Gazette</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00539.html">October 18, 1888 </a>. Whitman said of the visit that "Summers hit me
      hard. He made a grand show-up—had fine ways—was young, strong,
      optimistic" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.74.html">Wednesday, September 26, 1888</a>).<a href="#r4">[back]

      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus

   <p id="loc.07541_n2">7. Nathan M. Baker was one
      of Whitman's caregivers. He would leave on July 15, 1888, to resume his medical
      training. Baker was replaced by W.A. Musgrove. For Whitman's comments on the
      transition, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.2.html">Monday, July 16, 1888</a>.<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="n4151">8. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="loc.03745_n1">9. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel, was Horace Traubel's
      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4319">11. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r11">[back]

   <p id="loc.07239_n2">12.  W. A. Musgrove replaced Dr.
      Nathan M. Baker as Whitman's caregiver on July 15, 1888. Musgrove was far less
      satisfactory than Baker. Traubel noted that "Musgrove is a cloudy man. I asked
      how M. got on. W. evaded the question by some general remark. . . . He
      [Musgrove] is only a nurse—not a doctor" (Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.2.html">Monday, July 16, 1888</a>). Yet, Whitman later described Musgrove as
      "kind active &amp; considerate all through" (See the letter from Whitman to
      Bucke of .<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">13. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
