      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>After a time of much anxiety about you the papers gave better accounts &amp; we may hope
      that your last word of promise &amp;
      encouragment has not yet been spoken to men. I got from Traubel<sup><a href="#n3041" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      the L. of G. of 1892—a noble  volume &amp; just such a one as I
      have wished to possess. My friend Standish O'Grady<sup><a href="#loc.05112_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> asks
      me to address a letter to you. Take, with his, my words of sympathy in your late
      heavy trial, &amp; of unalterable homage &amp; love. You have given such faith &amp;
      courage to so many souls that I doubt not your own ride  high over all surges of pain &amp;
      physical dissolution. And I pray that strength &amp; cheer may reach you from those
      deepest sources which you have opened up for others &amp; set flowing eternally.
      Goodbye dear Walt, may God bless and keep you in any and every [
      <span class="unclear">lot?</span>]
       that may be yours.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3041">1. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was a close acquaintance of Walt Whitman and one of the poet's literary
      executors. He met Whitman in 1873 and proceeded to visit the aging author almost
      daily beginning in mid-1880s. The result of these meetings—during which
      Traubel took meticulous notes—is the nine-volume collection <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/index.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em>. Later in life, Traubel also
      published Whitmanesque poetry and revolutionary essays. He died in 1919, shortly
      after he claimed to have seen a vision of Whitman beckoning him to 'Come on'.
      For more on Traubel, see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. (1858–1919)</a>, <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, ed., (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 740–741.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.05112_n2">2. The historical writings of
      Standish O'Grady (1846–1928) were an inspiration to the great Irish
      Literary Revival. He has often been referred to as the father of this movement.
      Between 1878 and 1880, he published the two volumes of <em>History
         of Ireland: Heroic Period</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
