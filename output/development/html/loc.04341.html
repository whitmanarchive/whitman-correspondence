      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your seasons outlast mine. Your book,<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r1">1</a></sup> a gift always to be handed down &amp; treasured
      by my clan, reached me on my 55<u>th</u> birthday, and made me wonder that your November
      Boughs still hang so rich with color, while my October Leaves are already pale and
      wilted.—I am very  grateful for your rememberance, &amp; touched by it withal. In
      many respects this collection (so strikingly &amp; fittingly put up) is one of the
      most significant—as it is the most various—of your enduring works.
      Rest tranquil, as you ever are, in the ripeness of your harvest &amp; fame,—well assured
      that, whether your pilgrimage is still to be long or brief, you "shall
      not wholly die".—I am always more and more your reader, and
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
