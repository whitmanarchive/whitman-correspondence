   <p>All the weather prophets here told us we were to have a cool summer to make up for

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07352_n3">3. Bucke is referring to "On,
      On the Same, Ye Jocund Twain!" Whitman told Bucke that he was submitting the
      poem to <em>Century</em> in his letter of . <em>Century</em> rejected the poem. See R.W.
      Gilder's  rejection letter to Whitman. The
      poet expressed his "botheration" about the rejection in his  and 
      letters to Bucke. The poem was eventually published in <em>Once a
         Week</em>, 9 June 1891.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n4284">4. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
