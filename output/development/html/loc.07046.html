      <br></br><br></br>My Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I hope the <em>To-days</em> have come safe to hand. I am thinking a great deal about the new edition; and cannot
      help hoping you are going to revert to the plan of the Centennial Edition, which issued
      your writings in two independent volumes. May I, without being presumptuous, dear
      Walt, tell you how I should dearly like to see them arranged? I want “Crossing Brooklyn
      Ferry,” “Song at Sunset,” “Song of the Open Road,” “Starting from Paumanok,” “Carol
      of Words,” “Carol of Occupations” and either as “As I Sat by Blue Ontario’s Shore”
      or the Preface to edit. 55 put into “Two Rivulets”—you could make room for them that
      the volumes might balance in size by making them exchange places with the “Centennial
      Songs” and the “Memoranda During the War”; not that these are not precious to me,
      but I want it dearest because I want in the Two Rivulet Volume what will best prepare
      the reader, lift him up to the true point of view, and make him all your own, before
      he comes to the inner sanctuary of “Calamus” &amp; “Walt Whitman” &amp; “Children of Adam.”
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Monday morn. Your letter just to hand. It gives me deep joy, dear Friend. I have sent
      copies of <em>To-Day</em> to Dr. Bucke &amp; John Burroughs but did not know of his change of address; so fear
      it has miscarried. I will send another, and also one to W. O’Connor.—You did not tell
      me about your fall—unless indeed a letter has been lost. It fills me with concern
      because of the difficulty it increases in getting that free out-door life that is
      so dear &amp; essential to your soul &amp; body, and because, too, I still cherished in my
      heart a hope that I should yet see you again—here in my own home—&amp; now it seems next
      to an impossibility. Right thankful am I to hear about Mrs. Davis—that she takes good
      care of you—please give her a friendly greeting from me. I am going to have rather
      a bothersome summer—first of all, the house full of workmen to make all clean &amp; tidy;
      &amp; then my Scotch lassie, friend &amp; factotum rather than servant, must have a holiday
      &amp; go to her friends in Scotland for a month. I shall heartily welcome your friend,
      no need to say, &amp; be sure to like her. Love from Grace &amp; Herb. &amp; most of all from
      me. I have plenty more to say but won’t delay this.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
