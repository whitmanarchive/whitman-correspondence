   <p>Your letter of 16<u>th</u> &amp; 17<sup><a href="#loc.07283_n5" id="r2">2</a></sup> just to hand, also the parcel
      (Revue Independante, Critic, &amp; Palermo papers). The Critic don't seem to have
      much in it, the Italian papers<sup><a href="#loc.07283_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I am sorry to say I
      cannot read (but glad to have them all the same for my collection), in the "R. Ind."
      there is just 8 pp. translation (Faces, Locomotive in Winter, A World below the
      brine) no comment at all, translation not good (translator did not fully understand
      the english text).<sup><a href="#loc.07283_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> It is funny he did not claim to
      translate from the <u>English</u> but from the "<u>American</u>." The bundle is all welcome. As to your letter,
      dear Walt, I cannot say how it grieves me that you have had to suffer so much, nor
      how rejoiced I am that you can say you are "decidedly better"—I pray earnestly
      that you may keep on the mend now and  have at least a good respite and rest; I wish I could get away to
      see you and stay a little with you—but you have good doctors and I am glad to
      think, a good nurse.<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r5">5</a></sup> You have also a wonderful constitution and I have great hopes
      you will make a good rally yet and be with us for many a good day and talk. I had
      a
      line from O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r6">6</a></sup> (sending me on your letter)<sup><a href="#loc.07283_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup> he said he had been bad but "am now better" which I was
      glad enough to hear. Willy Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r8">8</a></sup> not here yet—untill he
      comes I have no idea when I can get away East about the meter business, and even
      after he comes I shall probably know very little more about it for awhile for he
      seems to have no ideas of <u>time</u> at all and his days are
      weeks and his months years.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are having a <u>mean</u> winter so far, mud (soft &amp;
      sometimes frozen in to spikes and lumps) dirty snow, bad wheeling, no
      sleighing—but we all keep well. Love to you as always

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07283_n2">3. The Italian newspaper
      contained a review of Luigi Gamberale's <em>Canti Scelti</em>
      (1887). See Whitman's letter to Bucke of .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07283_n3">4. Bucke is referring to
      the translations of Francis Viélé-Griffin, an American expatriate (Gay
      Wilson Allen, <em>Walt Whitman Handbook</em> [Chicago: Packard,
      1946], 490–91). According to Saunders (MS bibliography), some of
      Viélé-Griffin's translations appeared in the <em>Revue
         Independente</em> in November 1888.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">5. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">6. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07283_n4">7. In a December 14, 1888,
      letter to Bucke, O'Connor wrote: "I send along this letter from Walt. Rather
      cheering on the whole. I have been very badly off, but am better. I have all
      your letters on the docket and will write as soon as I can. Don't think I have
      forsaken you!." O'Connor is referring to a circular letter sent by Whitman to
      William Sloane Kennedy, John Burroughs, William D. O'Connor, and Bucke on . O'Connor's letter to
      Bucke is part of the Charles E. Feinberg Collection held at the Library of
      Congress.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4284">8. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
