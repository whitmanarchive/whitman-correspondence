      <br></br><br></br>Frank and May Baker,
      <br></br>Dear friends,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your kind letters reached me this morning—it does me good to get such kind reminders—&amp;
      to know I am still
      so remembered &amp; affectionately invited &amp; asked for. I shall pay you the visit.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Last three weeks I have been extra sick—was taken with bad vertigo spells, vomiting,
      &amp; fits of prostration—lasted for
      several days, bad at intervals, and, though the worst seems to have past, am left
      weak &amp; sort of qualmish, with headache.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is now as I write about 1 P.M. &amp; very fine—I have been out on the side walk in
      the sun, but had to get back soon—doctor comes every day—thinks it mainly a serious
      affection of <em>liver</em>, (&amp; stomach too), very
      obstinate—thinks it (this trouble) does not proceed from brain, heart, lungs, kidneys—(those,
      according to him, 
      are all right)—thinks it indeed not improbable that my tedious paralysis, &amp; all the
      cerebral business, &amp;c. have
      had their bases (reflexes, &amp;c from emotional bases) in <em>said liver</em> trouble—I am much inclined
      to think he has hit it—Am taking medicine—bromides of potash &amp; ammonium—have been
      taking moderate calomel powders—sit up now all day—but havn't been out, (except to the front door, or stoop, like,) for nearly three weeks—Keep
      
      good heart, &amp; expect to yet get, not vigorously well, but <em>comparatively well</em>—Want to come on &amp;
      see you, &amp; see the baby, &amp; expect to do so—will send you word—(must first visit Mr.
      &amp; Mrs. Nash, however, at Navy Yard,
      as I said<sup><a href="#prc.00032_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>)—Frank, what did you see of the London <em>Academy</em> criticism?<sup><a href="#prc.00032_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I only saw an extract in the Boston <em>Courier</em>, half a column—
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">Love to you, dear friends—not forgetting the dear baby—
      <br></br>Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Frank, I wish to be remembered to Arnold Johnson in the office—tell him I sent my
      love to him—
