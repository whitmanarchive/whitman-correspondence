      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was extremely pleased, last evening, to receive the copy of Ingersoll's<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r2">2</a></sup> lecture<sup><a href="#loc.04697_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> you were kind enough to
      send me, &amp; I thank you for it with all my heart.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have read it over tonight for the first time.—I was hardly prepossessed in
      its favour. I had previously known but little of Ingersoll. And I learned from
      Carlyle<sup><a href="#n4301" id="r4">4</a></sup>, long ago, to care little for
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>platform "oratory" as such, &amp; to consider the main question always (as <u>you</u> do) "What does it amount to?" And the newspaper
      reports (necessarily brief &amp; imperfect) did not make it appear to amount to very
      much.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But the full report, as I read it, swept away all prepossession &amp; criticism,
      &amp; filled me with a great &amp; dilating joy. It is a great &amp; notable
      utterance—strong, manly brave &amp; free—worthy of its subject, &amp;
      worthy of a great American orator to an American audience.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I feel as though I should like to write to Ingersoll himself to thank him for it.
      And
      rejoice, with all my heart, that at last <u>you</u> should have
      heard so strong a public declaration of the value of your work. Honour to Ingersoll
      for it! and gratitude &amp; love to him from all your friends here.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But my rejoicing is greatly disturbed &amp; overclouded by intelligence received at
      noon today of your relapse &amp; ill health. Dr. J.<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r5">5</a></sup> sent me a
      copy of a paragraph in yesterdays "<u>Daily Graphic</u>" as
      follows:—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>"A post card received from Walt Whitman says:—'Am having an extra bad spell
      these days. May <u>blow over; may not</u>.'"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>No date is given so that I do not know when it was written. But we shall be very
      anxious indeed till we hear further. I will write to Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r6">6</a></sup> by
      this mail to ask him to send word at once.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dearest &amp; best of friends! Most honoured of benefactors! What <u>can</u> we say to you?—but that our warmest love &amp;
      sympathy &amp; our hearts' best wishes are with you always.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">With best love
      <br></br>Yours affectionately
      <br></br>J.W. Wallace

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0839">2. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r2">[back]

      was a Scottish essayist, historian, lecturer, and philosopher. For more on

   <p id="n4267">6. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
