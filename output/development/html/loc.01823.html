      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I can't come down so I transcribe and send to you the enclosed dithyramb which
      forms nearly the whole of a letter I got from Mrs. Whitman this morning. She
      alludes to a number of passages I marked in the copy of the book you gave me for her. I
      told her I would mark passages for her in the copy I meant to send on my own
      hook, but didn't send because you gave me the book, so I marked your copy.
      
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours faithfully
      <br></br>W.D.O'C.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If you should write direct to me at Dr. Channing's, 67 [
      <span class="unclear">Congress?</span>]
       Street,
      Providence, R. I.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>How shall I thank our poet for the beautiful book, and for <u>my</u> name written in it by his own hand so near his own! His "cousin"
      had not dared to ask for this. The great, the <u>good</u>
      Camerado! The lover of men! The
      Consoler! The Interpreter! How
      strange it seems to me <u>now</u> that I should have been so
      near him without knowing him better! How many questions that I asked you about
      him would have needed no answer, if I had but have read his book <u>then</u> as I have read it <u>now</u>.
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Is it <u>your</u> haunting voice as I heard it that last
      night we were together, chanting to me that divine song of Death—that
      "word out of the sea"—is it your voice ("O heart of love and soul of
      fire!")
      
      that has lent to these poems such a mysterious rhythmic charm—such
      majestic meanings—  such sweet and solemn cadences?
   </p>
   
   <p>"Never more shall I escape—</p>
   
   <p>"Never more the reverberations."</p>
   
   
   <p>I have read all the passages you marked for me with a longing, lingering
      delight—read them again and again, dreading to have heard the last.
   </p>
   
   <p>How he probes and searches all hearts with his "barbed tongue!" How he gives
      expression to our most secret and presumptuous thoughts—as in the lines
      beginning
   </p>
   
   <p> "Have you thought there could be but one Supreme?"</p>
   
   <p> —I have many things to say to you about these <u>poems</u>; but not <u>now</u>.
   </p>
