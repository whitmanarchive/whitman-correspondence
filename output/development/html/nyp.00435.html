   <p>
      Rec'd
      
       yours to-day—Sorry you 
      didnt
      
       get the letter sent that day I met you, as I
      wanted you to have it particular<sup><a href="#nyp.00435_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—but perhaps it
      has come to hand—that it went to Berlin p. o. I have no doubt, as I mailed it
      myself, addressed it to you "care of Sheriff Gibbs"<sup><a href="#nyp.00435_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> same
      as this envelope—
   </p>
   
   <p>I hear Ed has sold the nag, &amp; gone off to seek his fortune, newspaper canvassing
      &amp;c.<sup><a href="#nyp.00435_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Whether he will make much money or
      not, I 
      dont
      
       know, but I feel sure he will learn a good deal &amp; get experience of
      the world &amp; people, &amp; <em>of himself</em> too—all of
      which is the <em>wisdom</em> described in scripture as better than
      riches—rec'd
      
       a long letter from Herbert Gilchrist, to-day<sup><a href="#nyp.00435_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—he seems to be well, &amp; working away hard at
      his painting—he describes to me some of his new pictures—says his mother
      was temporarily quite unwell, when he wrote—Edward Carpenter was visiting
      them—has a big beard—
   </p>
   
   <p>Nothing new with me—I keep well as usual—you say when I have a <em>blue spell</em> I must write to you—I don't have any such
      spells—&amp; seems to me it is time you grew out of them—my theory is
      that it is <em>in 
         onesself
         
         </em> and not from outside circumstances one
      suffers such unhappy hours—the more one yields to them the frequenter &amp;
      stronger they get until at last they take complete possession of a
      fellow—Harry dear, you are a good wrestler—see if you 
      cant
      
       <em>throw them</em> &amp; keep 'em thrown—
   </p>
   
   <p>But I ought to write you something cheerful—I have been in all day—quite
      a deep snow &amp; the wind blowing—I here in my big rocking chair at a job
      writing—Oscar Wilde sent me his picture yesterday, a photo a foot &amp; a half
      long, nearly full length, very good—
   </p>
   
   <p>As this letter has little or nothing in it I suppose it will be sure to reach you
      &amp; not miss—like the other I wanted you to get—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00435_n1">1. This letter is endorsed
      (by Richard Maurice Bucke): "1882." January 31 occurred on Tuesday in 1882. The
      year is also confirmed by the reference to Oscar Wilde.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00435_n2">2. Whitman was probably
      referring to his letter to Harry Stafford of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00435_n3">3. In 1881 Whitman noted
      Harry's address as "care of T B Gibbs—Berlin N J" (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00435_n4">4. Evidently Edwin Stafford
      was in Indiana, Pa., since that was his address when Whitman wrote (lost) to him
      on February 3. He was in Kirkwood, however, on March 31 (see the letter from
      Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist of ).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00435_n5">5. See Gilchrist's letter of
      .<a href="#r5">[back]
