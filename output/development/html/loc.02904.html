   </p>
   
   <p> Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> is here—now two days. We are having a capital
      time together. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I am knocking off work to have a good visit with him. (Am so tired at night after
      all chores are done that I have not been able to do much more than crawl into bed.
      This will excuse my dilatoriness as a correspondent)
   </p>
   
   <p> Rhys &amp; I go up to lunch with Sanborn<sup><a href="#n0915" id="r3">3</a></sup> Friday—Rhys to
      stay all night. Saturday he goes to the Saint Botolph Club,<sup><a href="#n3098" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      &amp; to-day (snowy) we have been concocting a <u>Boston
         Herald</u> blast (varied by a forest walk after fresh eggs. I am much pleased
      with Rhys 
       his bright
      optimistic nature. We are rubbing together as contentedly as two cats. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Had a good letter from Sidney Morse,<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; was (as tickled as
      Rhys says you were) over his <u>fine old mother</u>. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I suppose Rhys will write you further. I fear you are suffering from that old enemy
      lethargy &amp; congested brain. Keep a good heart, dear friend, &amp; believe me
      yours as ever 
   </p>

   <p>P.S.</p>
   
   <p> Rhys is obeying 
      yr
      
       injunction to show me myself. Nothing delights me more &amp; my
      limitations are so many. I see changes of improvement in many directions
      already— from his friendly suggestions.

   <p>Rhys sends love. I may see you soon myself. </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02904_n2">1. Based on the information
      provided in this letter, it was written in 1888. Whitman had misdated it in the
      first days of the new year.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03310_n1">2. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0915">3. Franklin B. Sanborn
      (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
      he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
      the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
      reviewed <em>Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Boston
         Commonwealth</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00059.html">February 24, 1866</a>. He was editor of the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
      his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
      appeared without Sanborn's name in the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K. Walker,
      "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_206.html">Sanborn, Franklin Benjamin (Frank) (1831–1917)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n3098">4. The St. Botolph Club, founded in
      1880, was a well-known social club in Boston, named after Botwulf of Thorney,
      the patron saint of Boston, England. The club attracted many luminary figures,
      including Henry Cabot Lodge and John Boyle O'Reilly.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0862">5. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.<a href="#r5">[back]
