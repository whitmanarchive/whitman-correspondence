      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> We left Ocean Grove the next day after I was with you, &amp; are now all home again,
      safe &amp; snug. I gave up the 
      Ky.
      
       trip for the present, Gilder<sup><a href="#n0871" id="r2">2</a></sup> said next spring would do, so I expect to go
      next May, &amp; see the season open down there. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I hope you are still mending, Walt. I am almost certain you eat  too heartily
      &amp; make too much blood &amp; fat; at least that you eat too hearty food. As I told
      you, I was profoundly impressed by a couple of articles in the "Fortnightly Review"
      by Sir Wm Thompson, on "Diet with relation to Age &amp;
      Activity" He shows very convincingly that as our activities fail by the advance of
      age, we must cut down on our food. If not the engine makes too much steam, things
      become cloged &amp; congested &amp; the whole economy of the system deranged.  He says a little
      meat once a day is enough, &amp; recommends the cereals &amp; fruits. I think you
      make too much blood. This congested condition of your organs at times, shows it. 
      Then you looked to me too fat;
      &amp; fat at your age clogs, &amp; hinders the circulation. I shall talk to my 
      Dr
      
       about you when I see him again, but if I were you I would adopt such a
      diet as would make my blood as thin as possible, &amp; so lessen the arterial
      strain This is common sense,  &amp; I believe good science. In the best health, we grow lean.
      Sir Wm Thompson, says like a man training for the
      ring.<sup><a href="#loc.01152_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> I gained much flesh this summer, &amp; am dull
      &amp; spiritless this fall. As a consequence, I must work it off some way. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Drop me a card if you can how you are.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0871">2. Richard Watson Gilder
      (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <em>The Century</em>, from 1881 until his death. Whitman had met
      Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1955], 482). Whitman attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
      Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the <em>New York Tribune</em>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder
      one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
      delirium" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">Sunday, August 5, 1888</a>). For more about Gilder, see Susan L.

   <p id="loc.01152_n1">3. Whitman seems to have shared
      these views on nutrition, telling Horace Traubel in 1888: "John about hit the
      truth. But I have been very abstemious the past three years—very
      conservative—as you know, and still here I am thrown down. Well, my time
      has come—that is all. You see, I am somewhat of a fatalist!" (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.95.html">Sunday, July 1, 1888</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
