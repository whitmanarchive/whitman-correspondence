      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been looking for you to visit me ever since we have been in camp here but I
      guess you are not coming so I have concluded to write you a short note to let you
      know that I am in good health and good spirits. I attended the Review the other day
      on purpos to see you, but I failed and I now fear you are not in Washington or I think I would
      have seen you. I wish you would come and see me if you can, I expect to go home soon.
      I think our Regiment will be in Washington the later part of this week or the first
      of next week and then I shall try to see you. If you see Miss H[oward]<sup><a href="#nyp.00179_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> please tell her I am sorry she did not call at my company the evening she was at
      the Regt. I heard from her in a short time after she had gone, but then it was to
      late.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am sorry that I did not see her and I hope I may have the pleasure of seeing you
      before I leave Washington. Hoping to hear from you soon I will close for to day, Yours
      Truly,
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>According to Whitman's
      "Hospital Book 12" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection), Sergeant Jesse Mullery,
      Company K, Fifteenth New Jersey, was in Ward A, Armory Square Hospital, on May
      14, 1864. The twenty-year-old boy had been "shot through shoulder, ball in
      lung—(ball still in probably near lung)—lost right finger." On June 23, 1864, he
      went home to Vernon, N. J., on furlough, and then served as assistant cook in
      the army hospital in Newark. On ,
      Mullery proposed a visit to Brooklyn. He was still at the Newark hospital on
      January 23, 1865. According to this letter and one of , he later was able to return to active duty.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00179_n2">1. In several letters Mullery
      referred to the kindnesses of Miss Howard while he was in the hospital, and
      another soldier, Charles H. Harris, on May 30, 1864 (Berg Collection, New York
      Public Library), asked to be remembered to Miss Howard and her sister. Probably
      these were the Misses Sallie and Carrie Howard listed in the 1866 Directory, or
      the Miss Garaphelia Howard mentioned in Whitman's letter to Ellen O'Connor from
      February 3, 1874 (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:271–272).<a href="#r1">[back]
