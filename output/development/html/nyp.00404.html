   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00404_n1">1. This letter bears the
      address: John Burroughs | Esopus-on-Hudson | New York. It is postmarked: New
      York | Mar 13 | 9 PM.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00404_n2">2. Walt Whitman was at
      Burroughs' home in Esopus from March 16 (Friday) to March 20. Burroughs noted
      the "great event" in his journal on March 21: "[Walt Whitman and Harry Stafford]
      cut up like two boys and annoyed me sometimes. Great tribulation in the kitchen
      in the morning. Can't get them up to breakfast in time. Walt takes Harry with
      him as a kind of foil or refuge from the intellectual bores" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York:
      Houghton Mifflin, 1931], 164).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00404_n3">3. According to the letter
      from Walt Whitman to John H. Johnston of , Whitman had agreed to sit for a portrait by noted landscape
      painter G. W. Waters. Burroughs, understandably, was not fond of the painting:
      "It gives Walt's benevolent look, but not his power—his elemental look. It
      makes him look rather soft, like a sort of Benjamin Franklin" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York:
      Houghton Mifflin, 1931], 164). The portrait appears as the frontispiece to the
      fifth volume of the Camden Edition. Waters' sketch also idealizes the poet (<em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Richard Bucke,
      Thomas Harned, Horace Traubel, Oscar Tiggs [New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902],
      1:202).<a href="#r3">[back]
