   <p>Y'r card came this mn'g &amp; makes me gloomy all day<sup><a href="#nyp.00654_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—was hoping from Dr's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r3">3</a></sup> and Horace's<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      acc't's there would likely be a good, a long continuation of "let up" and easier
      time—&amp; hope indeed when this comes, there will be again—
   </p>
   
   <p>Matters here ab't "the same subject continued" as my former writing—I don't see
      much of Dr B—he is engrossed with the meter business<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup>—&amp; has many
      acquaintances &amp; invitations—&amp; much to do any how—expects to
      return to Canada early the coming week.
   </p>
   
   <p><em>Sunday noon March 10</em></p> 
   
   <p>A raw not clear day—Dr B and Horace call'd—nothing specially new—much sympathy for
      Wm<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; prayers &amp; hopes he is better much—Dr B is probably to return home within a day
      or so—much depends on him there—I am suffering among the rest with a bad obstinate
      lingering cold in the head—sitting here alone by the stove as I write—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

      wrote that two days earlier William "had <em>five</em> of those
      epileptic seizures . . . going from one to another without recovering
      consciousness" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.48.html">Saturday, March 9, 1889</a>).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
