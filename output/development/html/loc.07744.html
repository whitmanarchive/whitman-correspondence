   <p>Here I linger along like a dead wither'd tree yet ("why cumbereth it the

      declining—yet spirits middling fair—&amp; appetite &amp; sleep
      fair—wh' is all something to be thankful for. If I were able how I sh'd like
      to come down there &amp; be with you all—I often think ab't you all &amp; ab't
      old times over at the Creek—Debby was here yesterday, &amp; she &amp; the
      little girl were welcome &amp; cheer'd me up—what a sweet little rose bush she
      is!—(She reminds me in her looks of Jo,<sup><a href="#loc.07744_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; then
      of her grandfather Geo:)—Susan, thank you for the nice chicken—I enjoy'd
      the eating of it well—I am sitting here in my den alone as usual—the sun
      is shining finely &amp; I shall probably get out in my wheel chair for an hour. Love
      to Harry<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r4">4</a></sup> and Ed<sup><a href="#n0589" id="r5">5</a></sup> and all—&amp; a

   <p><em>Correspondents:</em><br>George Stafford was the father of
      Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's
      parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near
      Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. For more
      on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>" <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, eds., (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 685.<br><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).<br></p>

   <p id="n0590">4. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
