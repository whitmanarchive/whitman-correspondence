      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Many thanks for thy card of the 3rd which came on Saturday, just too late for me to
      catch the return mail. I am afraid by a curious fatality all thy biographers want
      to
      make thee out <u>too good</u> for thy liking! Has thee never
      thought of expanding the Specimen Days into Autobiographical sketches? Then thee
      could tell the world thy wickedness to the full, which  thy friends are so
      uncomprehending as not to see! I wonder if thee knows Mr. Norman personally? He is
      a charming fellow, very clever and full of American pluck. He is always so busy that
      one seldom gets a chance of seeing him in the seething side of affairs in this great
      city, but I am going to make my husband look him up again, now that I know he is a
      friend of thine. 
   </p>
   
   <p>We have had nothing here but a succession of thick fogs, and today when I saw the
      flush of the real sun in the sky, I thought it was a fire!
      
      In pursuance of the course of reading I wrote to thee about, I have begun to take
      Greek lessons and to read Plato's Republic. In our spare moments (which are alas!
      none too many) we are working out our idea of the ideal State, as a sort of
      supplement and corrective to Socialism. But life rushes along too fast here to give
      one time for many wayside reflections, I am afraid, and too often I find whole days
      filled up with <u>things</u>—thoughts being crowded out.
      Perhaps it is good to live an intensely practical life for  a while. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I am very grateful for thy little slip anent Tennyson's latest, although I don't
      agree with it at all. Tennyson struck me as a man great <u>in
         spots</u>, and the cracks filled in with inferior stuff. I think this latest
      outburst of cynical pessimism comes from one of the gaps in the greatness of his
      nature. Perhaps thee will think this the hasty &amp; impulsive judgment of youth. I
      will begin to reconsider it when I find thee issuing a latest edition of Leaves of
      Grass with all the optimism  and faith and kindliness left out. I should have been glad to die
      before I had left <u>such</u> a message as my last utterance, the
      final outcome of a long life of experience and thought. I can't join with thee in
      thanking him for his "Sixty Years After"!<sup><a href="#loc.01360_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I judge people by different standards from
      those which one uses towards Nature, for I think the gulf between natural evolution
      &amp; moral responsibility is <u>infinite</u>, and if the present
      poems of Tennyson are the result of his point of view all along, then I think he is
      responsible for taking such a point of view [
      <span class="unclear">&amp; for?</span>]
       working it out to this
      disheartening issue.
   </p>
   
   <p>But I am disobeying my doctor, who has forbidden long letters for the present. It
      is
      always a temptation to chat with thee—I only wish I were near enough to do it
      <u>really</u>. Thee can't think what a refreshment to soul
      and body it is to read Leaves of Grass, or even to think of thee, in the midst of
      this artificial town life. I hope thee is well and cheerful; I am always silently
      sending thee good wishes across the ocean. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01360_n1">1. Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem,
      "Locksley Hall Sixty Years After," was published in 1886; it is a sequel to his
      1842 "Locksley Hall" and offers a bleak assessment of what England has
      become.<a href="#r1">[back]
