   <p>It gets very tedious here—(I have now been in my room and bed five
      weeks)—I am sitting up in a rocker and get along better than you would
      think—I think upon the whole I am getting mending—slowly and faintly
      enough yet sort o' perceptibly—the trouble is sore and broken brain—the
      old nag gives out and it hurts to even go or draw at all—but there are some
      signs the last two days that slight ambles will justify themselves—even for
      old habit, if nothing else—

   <p>It was probably the sixth or seventh whack of my war paralysis, and a pretty severe
      one—the doctors looked glum—Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r1">1</a></sup> I think saved my
      life as he happened to be here—Shimmering, fluctuating since, probably
      gathering, recruiting, but as I now write I shall rally or partially
      rally—only every time lets me down a peg—I hear from you by Horace
      Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I have an idea
      that O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r3">3</a></sup> is a little better.<sup><a href="#med.00852_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>A rainy evening here, not at all hot, quiet—</p>
   
   <p>Friday July 13—Just after noon—Ab't the same. I am sitting up, had a fair
      night—rose late, have eaten my breakfast—have rec'd a good letter from
      O'C—nothing very special or new—fine, clear, cool. Today my head <em>thicks</em> somewhat today. Love to you, dear friend. Love and
      remembrance to 'Sula,<sup><a href="#n0892" id="r5">5</a></sup> to July,<sup><a href="#loc.01151_n1" id="r6">6</a></sup> too.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">3. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00852_n1">4. Traubel's letters to
      Burroughs are published in Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931),
      277–280. On July 12, 1888, Burroughs tried to reconcile himself in his
      journal to the possibility of Whitman's death: "How life will seem to me with
      Whitman gone, I cannot imagine. He is my larger, greater, earlier self. No man
      alive seems quite so near to me" (280).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0892">5. Ursula North Burroughs
      (1836–1917) was John Burroughs's wife. Ursula and John were married on
      September 12, 1857. The couple maintained a small farm overlooking the Hudson
      River in West Park, Ulster County. They adopted a son, Julian, at two months of
      age. It was only later revealed that John himself was the biological father of
      Julian.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.01151_n1">6. Julian Burroughs
      (1878–1954), the only son of John and Ursula Burroughs, later became a
      landscape painter, writer, and photographer.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n3999">7. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
