   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00092_n1">1. This postal card is
      addressed: J H Johnston | Diamond Merchant | 150 Bowery cor: Broome St:| New
      York City. This postal card is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | Nov 10 | 430 PM | 87.
      John H. Johnston, the New York Jeweler, visited Whitman on November 2, at which
      time the poet paid Sidney Morse, presumably for one of his busts, "30 &amp;
      10-$40" (Whitman's Commonplace Book; Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
      On November 15 Walt Whitman noted receipt of ten dollars from Johnston "(wh' I
      paid to M) (Whitman's Commonplace Book). On August 27, Whitman gave Morse $70
      "to pay to caster for the 10 heads" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Morse brought
      four of the heads on September 2, one of which was sent to Richard Maurice Bucke
      (Commonplace Book). On November 12, 1887, Conway proposed taking Whitman to
      visit Robert Pearsall Smith in Philadelphia for a few days, an invitation which
      he declined (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="upa.00092_n2">2. The Fujiyama porcelain
      decorating workshop in Boston was producing work around this time. Johnston may
      have given Whitman a vase.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0862">3. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0170">4. Moncure Daniel Conway (1832–1907) was an
      American abolitionist and frequent correspondent with Walt Whitman. Conway often
      acted as Whitman's agent and occasional public relations man in England. For
      more on Conway, see Philip W. Leon, ""<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_182.html">Conway Moncure Daniel (1832–1907)</a>," <em>Walt
