   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Sir: It is probable that my friend Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r1">1</a></sup> has told you
      something of me and the work I am trying to do for you and for American literature.
      I have not written to you for the reason that you are sufficiently plagued with
      letters but now I feel that I have reached the point where I can presume on your
      interest.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr. Kennedy I know writes to you in a depressed mood many times, saying that he finds
      
       a "solid line of
      enemies" (I think those were his words) This is not true of my experience. I am
      often astonished at finding so many friends and sympathizers in your work and cause.
      In my teaching and lecturing I find no difficulty in getting Converts to the new
      doctrine and find your poems nearly irresistible in effect. True they do not always
      agree that they <u>are</u> "poems" though acknowledging their power and beauty. I
      do not care what they call them (I say to them) and receive their allegiance just
      the same.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope to do much in the way of reading and lecturing to bring your work before 
       the people and
      it would give me pleasure to know you consider my work valuable.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am just now delivering a course of lectures in the city on "The Literature of
      Democracy" concerning which I enclose a couple of slips.
   </p>
   
   <p>In these I am trying to analyze certain tendencies of American Life somewhat in
      accordance with the principles you have taught. How successful I may be remains to
      be seen.—I have not seen Mr. Kennedy for some months, he is so busy these
      days, but I had a characteristic letter from him a few days ago. I have the greatest
      hope of seeing you some day and 
       to talk with you
      upon these matters face to face. Let me assure you again that there is everywhere
      a
      growing respect and love for you and a growing appreciation of your poems. The
      papers no longer ridicule or even condemn unreservedly. An acquantaince among the
      younger literary editors of the city warrants me in saying that there is much more
      sympathy and appreciation among <u>them</u> than our friend
      Kennedy realizes. There is great gain.
   </p>
   
   <p>It would give me great pleasure to hear from you if you are able to write.</p>

      (1860–1940) was an American novelist and autobiographer, known especially
      for his works about the hardships of farm life in the American Midwest. For his
      relationship to Whitman, see Thomas K. Dean, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_190.html">Garland, Hamlin</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3039">1. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
