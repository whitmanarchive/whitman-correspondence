      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I got a long letter from George, dated near Lancaster, Kentucky, May 15th<sup><a href="#loc.00772_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—he seems to be well &amp; in good spirits, says he gets some letters from me &amp; papers
      too—At the time he wrote, the 51st was doing provost duty at Lancaster, but would
      not probably remain so very long—seem to be moving toward southeast Kentucky—had a
      good camp, &amp; good times generally. LeGendre<sup><a href="#loc.00772_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> is colonel—Gen. Ferrero<sup><a href="#loc.00772_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> has left the service—Col. Potter<sup><a href="#loc.00772_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> (now Brig. Gen.) is in Cincinnati—Capt. Sims<sup><a href="#loc.00772_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp;c are all well—George describes Kentucky as a very fine country—says the people
      are about half &amp; half, secesh &amp; union. This is the longest letter I have yet rec'd
      from George. Did he write you one about the same time? Mother, I have not rec'd any
      word from home in over a week—the last letter I had from Mr. Lane was about 12 days ago, sending me $10 for the
      soldiers, (5 from Mr. Kirkwood<sup><a href="#loc.00772_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; 5 from Conklin Brush.)<sup><a href="#loc.00772_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother dear, I should like to hear from Martha, I wish Jeff would write me about it<sup><a href="#loc.00772_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>—has Andrew gone? &amp; how is your wrist &amp; arm, mother—We have had some very hot weather
      here—I don't know what I should have done without the thin grey coat you sent—you
      don't know how good it does, &amp; looks too—I wore it three days, &amp; carried a fan &amp; an
      umbrella, (quite a Japanee)—most every body here carries an umbrella, on acc't of the sun—yesterday &amp; to-day
      however have been quite cool, east wind—Mother, the shirts were a real godsend, they
      do first rate, I like the fancy Marseilles collar &amp; wristbands—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, how are you getting along—I suppose just the same as ever—I suppose Jess &amp; Ed are just the same as ever—when you write, you tell me all
      about every thing, &amp; the Browns,<sup><a href="#loc.00772_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> &amp; the neighborhood generally. Mother, is George's trunk home &amp; of no use, there?
      I wish I had it here, as I must have a trunk—but do not wish you to send it, until
      I send you word—I suppose my letter never appeared in the Eagle,<sup><a href="#loc.00772_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> well I shall send them no more, as I think likely they hate to put in any thing which
      may celebrate me a little, even though it is just the thing they want for their paper
      &amp; readers. They altered the other letter on that account, very meanly. I shall probably
      have letters in the N. Y. Times &amp; perhaps other papers in about a week<sup><a href="#loc.00772_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup>—Mother, I have been pretty active in hospitals for the past two weeks, somewhere every day or night—I have written you so much about cases &amp;c I will
      not write you any more, on that subject this time—O the sad, sad things I see, the
      noble young men with legs &amp; arms taken off—the deaths—the sick weakness, sicker than
      death, that some endure, after amputations—(there is a great difference, some make
      little of it, others lie after it for days, just flickering alive, &amp; O so deathly
      weak &amp; sick)—I go this afternoon to Campbell Hospital, out a couple of miles.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I should like to have Jeff send me 20 of the large sized portraits &amp; as many
      of the standing figure, do them up flat. I think every day about Martha. Mother, have
      you heard any further about Han? Good bye for the present, dearest mother.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00772_n1">1. This letter to Whitman
      and one to his mother on the following day are apparently lost. There is a
      letter from George to Jeff, dated May 15, 1863, in the Missouri Historical
      Society. On May 29, from "Heusonville" [Hustonville], Kentucky (Trent Collection
      of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections
      Library); Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint
         Clews &amp; Indirections</em> [Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1949],
      156-158), George described the recent movements of his regiment.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00772_n2">2. See Whitman's letter from
      .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00772_n3">3. Walt Whitman's or
      George's information about Ferrero (see his letter from ) was
      incorrect; he did not leave the service at this time.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00772_n4">4. Robert Brown Potter
      (1829–1887) was a lawyer who enlisted as a private at the beginning of the
      war. He rose rapidly and became a lieutenant colonel on November 1, 1861, in
      George's regiment. From March 16 through March 18, 1862, George described
      Potter's bravery in the battle at New Bern, North Carolina: "I went up to him
      and asked him if he was struck, he said only with a spent ball that did not hurt
      him mutch, and he got up and went into the thickest of it again and did not give
      up untill the fighting was over which was an hour after I spoke to him, when he
      found a ball had struck him just above the hip and passed through his side"
      (Trent Collection). Whitman described Potter's courage in the <em>New York Times</em>, October 29, 1864 (Emory Holloway, ed., <em>The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman</em> [Garden
      City, N.Y.: Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., 1921], 2:38–39).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00772_n5">5. Whitman stayed in the
      tent of Samuel H. Sims (or Simms) when he visited George at Fredericksburg
      (Charles I. Glicksberg, <em>Walt Whitman and the Civil War</em>
      [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1933], 69–70), and
      commended him in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Union</em> of September
      22, 1863 (<em>The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt
         Whitman</em>, 2:29). According to the <em>New York State
         Muster Rolls</em>, Sims had recruited George for the Fifty-first Regiment.
      He was killed in the Petersburg mine explosion in 1864; see Richard Maurice
      Bucke's <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> (New York,
      G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902), 4:134, and Whitman's letter from 
      .<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00772_n6">6. James P. Kirkwood was a
      New York engineer; he probably heard of Whitman's hospital work through Moses
      Lane. See his letter from 
      .<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00772_n7">7. Conklin Brush was
      president of the Mechanics' Bank, Brooklyn, according to the Directories of
      1861–1862 and 1865–1866.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00772_n8">8. Martha Mitchell Whitman,
      also known as "Mattie," was Whitman's sister-in-law and wife of his brother
      Jeff. At the time of this letter, Martha was pregnant. Jeff wrote on May 27,
      1863: "Mattie is well yet but how long she will continue so is a question, she
      is getting along first rate, she has a young girl to help her do the house work
      and is in the best of spirits" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00772_n9">9. The Browns lived for five
      years with the Whitmans on Portland Avenue, Brooklyn. He was a tailor. Relations
      between the two families were sometimes strained; see Whitman's letter from . On June 3, 1865 (Trent Collection),
      Mrs. Whitman informed her son that she was glad to move away from the
      Browns.<a href="#r9">[back]

      been identified (<em>Correspondence</em>, 1:105).<a href="#r11">[back]
