   <p>Yesterday (Sunday afternoon) read again with deepest interest the Songs of Parting.
      I
      keep touching deeper + not before understood tho'ts with my plummet in reading
      you,—espec. in these [illegible] hymns
      of the Infinite. The [
      <span class="unclear">productions?</span>]
       of Homer + Milton seem quite boyish in comparison with
      the profound closing [illegible] L. of G. It
      is a refreshing draught to me after the <u>[
         <span class="unclear">bafflement?</span>]
         </u> of
      the week in newspapers. Be sure to read Tyndall's fascinating long article of
      reminiscences of Carlyle<sup><a href="#n4301" id="r1">1</a></sup> in January <u>Fortnightly</u>.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
