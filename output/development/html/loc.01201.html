      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I send here with five dollars (5.00) a sort of "Widows Mite"<sup><a href="#loc.01201_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> to aid your Citizen, Poet, and
      Philanthropist—Walt Whitman
   </p>  
   
   <p>I marvel at our Country that its intellect
      should be an object of charity—And aid from a foreign Country called to bestow
      Alms. 
   </p>
   
   <p>But the universal greed for gain; which Americans to-day seek, to the exclusion  of everything
      Morally, Socially or intellectually, gives little encouragement for a life
      devoted to Culture.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours Respectfully
      <br></br>James. S Charles, D.D.S.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James S. Charles (d. 1892) moved
      from Philadelphia to Marion, Iowa, and then in 1866 to Omaha, Nebraska, where he
      practiced as a dentist. Charles invented and patented a fountain-pen holder and
      a horseshoe. In an article about his death in 1892, which was ruled a suicide
      but which relatives believed was a robbery and murder, his ex-wife claimed that
      "her former husband was in the habit of carrying diamonds to the value of
      several thousand dollars and he always carried a valuable watch" ("Think it a
      Murder," <em>Chicago Tribune</em> 11 January 1892).

   <p id="loc.01201_n1">1. A Biblical reference to the
      donation by a widow of two small coins ("mites"), which Jesus says are worth
      more than the much larger (but proportionately smaller) donations of the rich;
      see Mark 12:41-44 and Luke 21:1-4.<a href="#r1">[back]
