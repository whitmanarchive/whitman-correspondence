      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is splendid here this forenoon—bright and cool. I was out early taking a
      short walk by the river—only two squares from where I live. I received your
      letter of last Monday<sup><a href="#loc.01583_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—also the <em>Star</em> same
      date—&amp; glad enough to hear from you—the oftener the better. Every
      word is good—I sent you a letter, on the 6th, which I suppose you rec'd next
      day. Tell Henry Hurt I received his letter of Oct. 5 all right, &amp; that it was
      welcome. Political meetings here every night. The coming Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio
      elections cause much talk &amp; excitement. The fall is upon us. Overcoats are in
      demand. I already begin to think about my return to Washington. A month has nearly
      passed away. I have received an invitation from a gentleman &amp; his wife, friends
      of mine, at Providence, R. I.<sup><a href="#loc.01583_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; shall
      probably go there &amp; spend a few days, latter part of October.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am grateful to these young men on the RR. for their love &amp; remembrance to
      me—Dave,<sup><a href="#loc.01583_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; Jim &amp; Charley Sorrell, Tom Hassett,
      Harry on No. 11.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Every day I find I have plenty to do—every hour is occupied with something.
      Shall I tell you about it, or part of it, just to fill up? I generally spend the
      forenoon in my room, writing &amp;c., then take a bath, fix up &amp; go out about
      12, &amp; loafe somewhere, or call on some one down town, or on business, or perhaps
      if it is very pleasant &amp; I feel like it, ride a trip with some driver-friend on
      Broadway from 23d street to Bowling Green, three miles each way. You know it is a
      never-ending amusement &amp; study &amp; recreation for me to ride a couple of
      hours, of a pleasant afternoon, on a Broadway stage in this way. You see everything
      as you pass, a sort of living, endless panorama—shops, &amp; splendid
      buildings, &amp; great windows, &amp; on the broad sidewalks crowds of women,
      richly-dressed, continually passing, altogether different, superior in style &amp;
      looks from any to be seen any where else—in fact a perfect stream of people,
      men too dressed in high style, &amp; plenty of foreigners—&amp; then in the
      streets the thick crowd of carriages, stages, carts, hotel &amp; private coaches,
      &amp; in fact all sorts of vehicles &amp; many first-class teams, mile after mile,
      &amp; the splendor of such a great street &amp; so many tall, ornamental, noble
      buildings, many of them of white marble, &amp; the gayety &amp; motion on every
      side—You will not wonder how much attraction all this is, on a fine day, to a
      great loafer like me, who enjoys so much seeing the busy world move by him, &amp;
      exhibiting itself for his amusement, while he takes it easy &amp; just looks on
      &amp; observes.<sup><a href="#loc.01583_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Then about the Broadway
      drivers, nearly all of them are my personal friends. Some have been much attached
      to
      me, for years, &amp; I to them. But I believe I have already mentioned them in a
      former letter. Yesterday I rode the trip I describe with a friend, on a 5th Avenue
      stage, No. 26—a sort [of] namesake of yours, Pete Calhoun.<sup><a href="#loc.01583_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> I have known him 9 or 10 years. The day was fine, &amp; I enjoyed the trip
      muchly. So I try to put in something in my letters to give you an idea of how I pass
      part of my time, &amp; what I see here in N. Y. Of course I have quite a
      variety—some four or five hours every day I most always spend in study,
      writing, &amp;c. The other serves for a good change. I am writing two or three
      pieces. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am having finished about 225 copies of Leaves of Grass bound up, to supply orders.
      Those copies form all that is left of the old editions. Then there will be no more
      in the market till I have my new &amp; improved edition set up &amp; stereotyped,
      which it is my present plan to do the ensuing winter at my leisure in
      Washington.<sup><a href="#loc.01583_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother is well, I take either dinner or supper with her every day. Remember me to
      David Stevens &amp; John Towers.<sup><a href="#loc.01583_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> Tell Harry on No 11 I will go
      [to] the Hall again &amp; see if I can find that man in the Sheriff's office.<sup><a href="#loc.01583_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> I send you my love,
      &amp; <em>so long</em> for the present. Yours for life, dear Pete,
      (&amp; death the same).

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

      this paragraph up to this point, and commented: "Truly a futile way of passing
      the time, some of you may say, and not altogether creditable to a grown-up man.
      And yet, from the deepest point of view, who knows the more of truth, and who
      knows the less,—Whitman on his omnibus-top, full of the inner joy with
      which the spectacle inspires him, or you, full of the disdain which the futility
      of his occupation excites?" (<em>Talks to Teachers on
         Psychology</em> [New York: H. Holt and Company, 1899], 252).<a href="#r5">[back]
