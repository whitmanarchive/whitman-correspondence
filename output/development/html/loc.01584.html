      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is splendid here to-day, &amp; I am feeling first-rate. We have had quite a 
      dark &amp; rainy spell—but now the prospect is good weather, clear sky, 
      bright sun, coolish, &amp; no dust. I shall spend an hour or two on the river to-day.
      
      Your letter of 27th,<sup><a href="#loc.01584_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Sunday, came this morning. Also two <em>Stars</em>, 25th &amp; 26, 
      the latter with Hinton's speech, the other containing an item about me.<sup><a href="#loc.01584_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> 
      The previous <em>Star</em> arrived with your note of 23d, written just as you were 
      going to see the Black Crook<sup><a href="#loc.01584_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—&amp; next morning another Star came. 
      Peter, you are a good boy, &amp; shall have your reward in Heaven, if not on earth.<sup><a href="#loc.01584_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now how about that cold? I see you went to work Saturday. You seem to be 
      under the weather more than I thought. Dear comrade, I hope this will find you all
      right 
      &amp; well as ever. I suppose you are working this week. Yesterday I spent most 
      of the day in Brooklyn helping the folks to finish up the moving business. 
      Got through just after dark. I have not been to any amusements yet. 
      Somehow I dont seem to care about them,<sup><a href="#loc.01584_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; I go around enough during the day. 
      There is considerable political excitement here—banners swung across the streets 
      almost every block, &amp; big transparences in front of the different headquarters. 
      I have seen several splendid torch-light processions, &amp; outdoor meetings, &amp;c. 
      Of course the great majority in New York &amp; Brooklyn is for Seymour &amp; Blair.<sup><a href="#loc.01584_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>To Jim Sorrell:<sup><a href="#loc.01584_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> Dear Jimmy: You may not understand it, what that lady said about the bedfellow business,
      
      but it's all right<sup><a href="#loc.01584_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> &amp; regular—besides, I guess you understand it well enough. 
      Jimmy, dear boy, I wish you was here with me—we could have such good times. 
      I send you my love—&amp; to Charley<sup><a href="#loc.01584_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> the same—Mention how Charley's young one is getting along—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will now bid you good bye for this time, my loving friend, &amp; God bless you, dear
      comrade, 
      &amp; keep you all right. I will write a line to No. 6,<sup><a href="#loc.01584_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup> &amp; will speak to the other boys in my next.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

      poet, except Tennyson, commands such a price in England." The Washington <em>Daily Morning Chronicle</em> on September 26, 1868, also noted
      that Walt Whitman had received "fifty pounds in gold." According to his letter
