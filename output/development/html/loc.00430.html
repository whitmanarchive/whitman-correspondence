      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>My last letter to you was dated from Springfield Mass. I went home on Sat. and had
      an oportunity to come up here and make some surveys for an Iron Company. I shall probably be kept
      here all this week and possibly part of next &nbsp;About the Eagle that had the little
      squib in about you.<sup><a href="#loc.00430_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I have not had much of an opportunity to try to get one to send you. I have not been
      able to get to the Eagle office, but tried at a number of the paper stores and could
      not get it. As soon as I get home I will go to the office and get one if I can, if
      not I will copy from their file the piece and send you. Walt there is no disposition
      not to get it, to send you or any unwillingness to take some trouble in the matter,
      but I have been so very busy the little time that I have been in Brooklyn that I really
      could not have time to go down to their office. Of course I have had to keep my work
      up in Brooklyn just the same as if I had not been away,—had to work day and night
      sundays and all, hardly had time to go home to see Mat. and the babies &nbsp;The fact of the matter
      is that I am a little overdoing the thing and if it was going to continue long should
      stop it but as I had this opportunity to make a little extra I felt as if I must tax
      myself a little. For instance I got to Brooklyn at 12<em>
         ock
         </em> Thursday night, went to the office early on Friday morning and I hardly left it till
      abt. 10<em>
         ck
         </em>on Sunday night. I tell you last night I felt the thing pretty bad.—In the early part
      of this month Mr Kirkwood<sup><a href="#loc.00430_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> sent me $5 to send you but I have been pretty hard up and had to use it. I will get
      some money as soon as I get back to Brooklyn again and will send it to you then.—When
      I wrote you last I was in rather a high state of excitement in regard to Jess and
      probably wrote rather strong—but I felt very angry and bad I can tell you. Mat has
      even hardly yet got over the trouble in her back, and altogether it was a mean dirty thing for Jess to do, for I know he knows
      better. You wrote Mother abt getting Jess in the Asylum—It does not seem to meet with her wishes.<sup><a href="#loc.00430_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> When I wrote you my idea was that by each of us paying—say a $ a week—you and I and
      George &nbsp;that we could keep him in some one of the Hospitals around New York—I think
      it would be best yet. Can you, from your intimacy with the doctors around Washington,
      get any information in regard to the matter. I have had several talks with Ruggles<sup><a href="#loc.00430_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> abt the thing and [he] says that there might be such a thing as it curing him.—helping
      him anyway &nbsp;but I feel as if it was our duty to relieve Mother of him—I still feel
      very nervous abt leaving him with them at home, with Mother, Mat and the babies, for I think he would
      be guilty of anything when the fits of passion and devilment are on him—he is certainly
      not to be trusted.—I have made several enquires and am told that he could be put in
      Hospital and have things all done for him at at $15 per month. I am sure that it would
      not be much and it would add many years to Mother's life I know. Mother seems to me
      to act foolish abt. the thing—for instance she won't come up in our rooms because she cant bring Jess
      along—<em>I will not allow him to come there</em> &nbsp;consequently it amounts to keeping Mother out. I feel mightly unpleasant abt it I can tell you—downhearted—dispirited—and matters dont go quite so pleasant at home as they used to. Mother thinks that we are foolish—I
      think I am right &nbsp;Dont understand me that either I or Mat have any enmity against Jess—for its not so. Mat
      speaks and acts towards him as she always has done, better I think than any other
      person on earth would after the affair of that Friday—Walt let us try and see if we
      cant get him in some place that Mother and Mat wont feel so bad about as they would
      if he was sent to the Asylum. I think it is a duty to our Mother for her comfort and
      indeed for her safty and of course I have another stake in my wife and children. For the safty of all of them I want that we should do it. Dont you think it could be done
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well Walt here I am abt 110 miles from New York, up in the Harlem and New York R. R. just on the edge of
      the state of Mass. among a mass of high mountains and deep valleys. The night is one
      of the wildest that I ever remember, the wind is blowing a gale, the snow and sleet
      and rain by turns come plashing against the windows. I am boarding at an old fashioned
      country house (I learn from a book on the table that it is the "Hon. Peter Kissenbrack"
      of the state Legislature of /62[)]<sup><a href="#loc.00430_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> as comfortable quarters as I ever enjoyed—good living good fire—good rooms and good
      bed—clever old dutch-fashioned American people. I've just been drinking some good
      cider and eating some fine apples. Everything thing is as comfortable and country
      like. Did you hear of the death of James Ward,<sup><a href="#loc.00430_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Jennie [DeBevoise's?]<sup><a href="#loc.00430_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> husband, a most singular case and very sudden. I suppose that Mother has written
      you abt. it. That iron-clad that sunk at Charleston drownded one of my intimate friends H.
      W. Merian<sup><a href="#loc.00430_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> as splendid a young man as ever lived. Do you remember I introduced you to him at
      Pfaffs<sup><a href="#loc.00430_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> a long time ago. He had a large circle of friends in Brooklyn, was the only son and
      almost worshipped by his family.  He was in my party on the line and was my room-mate
      for a year. I felt pretty bad when I heard he was dead. Probasco<sup><a href="#loc.00430_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> I see every few days, that is when I am in Brooklyn &nbsp;The other evening he came in
      the office, asked me how Andrew left his widow. I told him almost destitute. he handed
      me $10 and told me to give her that. I thought it wonderful generous for one who hardly
      had ever seen Andrew. He said $5 of it was from Tom Tweedy,<sup><a href="#loc.00430_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup> the Gent we saw at his store the one that gave you the hat. Abt a week ago one of the men in the department that Andrew was in in the navy yard came
      and gave Nancy $30 saying that they had raffled off Andrews chest of that tools at
      that price, so as she had considerable money I did not yet give her the $10 (indeed
      I have had to use some of it) but will give it to her the first of next week—Nancy
      is abt the same as ever—she seems to have no idea of getting along—she says she would work
      if she had it—but no idea of getting it. Mat has been trying to get her some and I
      think will succeed in a few days
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Matters and things around the office are the same as usual. Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00430_n12" id="r12">12</a></sup> is as kind as anyone could well be—the Dr comes in every day for a short time, and
      things looked jolly enough around there the few days I was home. There is some talk
      that Sam. Powell<sup><a href="#loc.00430_n13" id="r13">13</a></sup> will be made Water Com. I hope so. I should consider it a good thing for me &nbsp;About
      my coming to Washington, do you think you could get the pass. if so I will surely
      come on. try for it wont you.—Kingsley<sup><a href="#loc.00430_n14" id="r14">14</a></sup> is very sick. Ruggles is tending him. Kingsley also has a little girl just lying
      at the point of death—a very painful affair—
   </p>
   
   <p>Otherwise that I have spoken of things are all quite well at home. When I was at Springfield
      Mother had a very hard time, but almost recovered from it. Mother works too hard &nbsp;I
      hope we can arrange it so that she wont have to always.
   </p>
   
   <p>Let me hear from you &nbsp; I shall be at home, I think the first of next week—</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00430_n1">1. The squib Jeff refers
      to was a short "Personal" item in the <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Eagle</em> of December 3, 1863, which praised Walt Whitman's work with the
      soldiers and read in part: "Who is there in Brooklyn who doesn't know Walt
      Whitman? Rough and ready, kind and considerate, generous and good, he was ever a
      friend in need." In a note appended to a letter from George from , Louisa Van Velsor Whitman said
      taht she thought that the article had been written by Dr. Ruggles, but Walt
      Whitman thought it was written by Joseph Howard, Jr. (see Edwin Haviland Miller,
      ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77], 1:190 and 190, n. 76).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00430_n3">3. Walt Whitman's letter
      is not extant. Apparently the poet agreed with Jeff that their brother Jesse
      needed to be institutionalized. Their mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,
      however, defended her firstborn: "Jessy is a very great trouble to me to be sure
      and dont appreceate what i doo for him but he is no more deranged than he has
      been for the last 3 years &nbsp;I think it would be very bad for him to be put in the
      lunatic assiliym...i could not find it in my heart to put him there withou i see
      something that would make it unsafe for me to have him" (December 25, 1863

      Special Collections Library]).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.00430_n5">5. Peter G. Kisselbrack
      (1825–?), a local politician, was elected to the New York State Assembly
      from Columbia County in 1862 and served one term, through 1863.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.00430_n6">6. James Ward died
      December 14, 1863 (<em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, December 14,

   <p id="loc.00430_n7">7. Although Jeff appears
      to have written "DeBenor's" or "DeBevor's," neither name is listed in the city
      directories. However, Jeff had maintained a long friendship with the DeBevoise
      family of Brooklyn, and perhaps this is the name he intended. Jeff would then be
      referring to a sister of his old friend William DeBevoise, which would explain
      Jeff's use of the maiden name. See Jeff's letter to Walt Whitman from .<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00430_n8">8. Henry W. Merian
      (1840–1863), third assistant engineer, United States Navy, perished with
      twenty-six others when the monitor <em>Weehawken</em> sank in a
      storm off Charleston, South Carolina, on December 16, 1865.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00430_n9">9. From roughly 1854 to
      1862 Walt Whitman moved in a circle of literary and theatrical people that met
      at Charles Pfaff's restaurant on Broadway near Bleecker Street. Here he met such
      writers as William Dean Howells, Richard Henry Stoddard, Thomas Bailey Aldrich,
      and Edmund Clarence Stedman.<a href="#r9">[back]

      Brooklyn, Colonel Alfred M. Wood, nominated Samuel S. Powell for water
      commissioner on February 1, 1864, but the Board of Aldermen refused to confirm
      him. On March 1, Wood nominated W. A. Fowler who was confirmed.<a href="#r13">[back]
