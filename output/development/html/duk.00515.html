   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00515_n11">1. This letter dates to
      February 23, 1869. In the body of the letter, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman said she
      wrote on Wednesday. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter February 25, 1868,
      but his date must be ruled out. Bucke's year "1868" may be a slip of the pen
      both because February 25, 1868 fell on Tuesday and because another February 25
      letter dates near the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 (see
      Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver dated this letter a year later,
      "February? 1869," and Edwin Haviland Miller reported their date (<em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman
         and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949],
      199–200; Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). The letter informs Walt
      about his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's difficulties with the rising
      river in St. Louis, and Louisa probably relied on a letter from Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman that survives only as an undated fragment. Randall H. Waldron
      dated Mattie's letter fragment to February 1869 on the basis of Gohdes and
      Silver's date for this Louisa Van Velsor Whitman letter (see <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1977], 67, 67, n. 1). The year 1869 is certain, but the range
      of possible dates in February can be narrowed to the latter part of month based
      on Louisa's remarks on the transition between the presidential administrations
      of Andrew Johnson and Ulysses S. Grant, which draw from her reading of the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>. The letter dates to February 23,
      1869, when a rumor first circulated that Edwards Pierrepont could be appointed
      as the attorney general under incoming president Ulysses S. Grant. Another
      remark on political news, on Andrew Johnson's pardon of John C. Devlin, probably
      comes from an article that appeared a week before the Pierrepont rumor surfaced.
      Louisa's remarks on political events seldom come more than a week after they are
      reported in the newspaper. In addition, another extant letter from Louisa to
      Walt dates to , and it is highly
      unlikely that this letter was written only one day after that one. Therefore,
      the date of the initial Pierrepont article, February 23, 1869 (Wednesday), is
      certain as this letter's date.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n2">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00515_n4">3. Margret Steers, her husband
      Thomas Steers (1826–1869), and their four children Thomas (b. 1853),
      Caroline (b. 1857), Louisa (b. 1862), and Margret (b. 1865) moved into the
      Atlantic Avenue building in November 1868. Thomas Steers operated a bakery, and
      his wife, who would become a close friend of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,
      continued the business when he died in January 1869. After Thomas Steers' sudden
      death, Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman replied to an early 1869 letter from
      Louisa (not extant) with concern that "Mr. Steers' death had quite an effect on
      you." George Washington Whitman sold a property to Margaret Steers in January
      1871, and the property had title trouble with regard to unpaid assessments (see
      Mattie Whitman's February? 1869 letter to Louisa in Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1977], 67; Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman; "Died,"
      <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, January 22, 1869, 3; <em>United States Census, 1870</em>. New York, Brooklyn Ward 7,
      Kings, District 1; and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00512_n11">4. Mrs. Black was a neighbor
      of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. She is also mentioned in Louisa's , , and 
      letters to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00515_n14">5. Rheumatism or arthritic
      rheumatism, which Louisa also spelled "rheumattis" or "rhumatis," is joint pain,
      which was attributed to dry joints. See <em>Health at Home, or
         Hall's Family Doctor</em> (Hartford: J. A. S. Betts, 1873), 704.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00515_n3">6. John Devlin was sentenced to
      two years imprisonment in February 1868 on the charge of running an unlicensed
      whiskey ring (<em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, February 5, 1868, 3).
      Outgoing President Andrew Johnson pardoned Devlin on February 16, 1869. The
      Devlin pardon was politically inflammatory because a Brooklyn Collector of
      Revenue, T. C. Callicott, was held to be party to Devlin's effort to defraud the
      government, though only John Devlin was convicted. The <em>Eagle</em> editorialized in favor of Johnson's pardon, minimized the
      suggestion of corruption, and implied that Benjamin F. Tracy, District Attorney
      for Kings County, New York, had overreached on a petty case ("Devlin's
      Pardon—A Query for District Attorney Tracy," <em>Brooklyn
         Daily Eagle</em>, February 17, 1869, 2). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman read
      against the grain of the Democratic-leaning <em>Eagle</em>'s
      editorial slant. She had indicated her skepticism toward the politics of the
      newspaper in her  letter to Walt
      Whitman: "the old eagle how i dislike it yet i take it if i dident see any other
      paper i should think andy was perfection and all the rest was crushed."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00515_n7">7. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      followed the potential appointments for attorney general closely because Walt
      Whitman was serving as a clerk in that office. Edwards Pierrepont
      (1817–1892) actively supported Republican candidate for president Ulysses
      S. Grant, and Pierrepont was rumored to be under consideration for appointment
      as attorney general ("Topics of To-day," <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Eagle</em>, February 23, 1869, 3). Grant, upon taking office, passed over
      Pierrepont for that office and instead appointed him the United States attorney
      for the southern district of New York (<em>New York Times</em>,
      April 28, 1869, 7). Pierrepont eventually joined Grant's cabinet as attorney
      general, but not until 1875 (Bruce Tap, "Pierrepont, Edwards," <em>American National Biography Online</em>).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">8. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">9. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="duk.00515_n13">10. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      mark to separate this paragraph from next, a short vertical slash or solidus, is
      on the next line, and the mark might be considered to enclose the next phrase,
      to precede the word "give." Louisa's mark most often resembles in shape a
      closing parenthesis mark. The mark has been transcribed, here as elsewhere, as a
      closing parenthesis, with no paired opening parenthesis. The choice of the
      closing parenthesis to represent Louisa's mark is to signal that the grammatical
      function for the mark is generally to close the previous phrase. Nonetheless,
      the range of styles for the mark are diverse, from marks that more closely
      resemble a vertical pipe to those that more closely resemble a comma. A vertical
      pipe is also a reasonable transcription for this mark.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00470_n8">11. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
      and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r11">[back]
