   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00757_n1">1. This card marks the
      beginning of Whitman's extensive correspondence with William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929), who at this time was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em>, and who later published biographies of
      Longfellow and Whittier (<em>Dictionary of American
         Biography</em>). Apparently Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on
      November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of
         Walt Whitman</em> [London: Alexander Gardner, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was
      to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first published article he
      admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of language" and protested
      that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158. Yet,
      according to John Burroughs's letter to Whitman on November 2, 1880, Kennedy was
      angered by Edmund Clarence Stedman's article in <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> (see the letter from Whitman to Burroughs of ), and thought that his own
      article did Whitman "fuller justice" (T. E. Hanley Collection, University of
      Texas). He vigorously defended his views in a letter to Burroughs on February
      26, 1881 (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
      201–204).<a href="#r1">[back]

      about Thomas Carlyle appeared in the New York <em>Tribune</em> on
      February 21. Whitman returned the clipping from the newspaper on February 28
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
