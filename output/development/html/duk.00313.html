      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter and Walts came all right and glad enough was I hear that you are getting
      a little better. You must have had a hard time Mother being sick so long but do not
      get discouraged and I hope you will soon be as well as ever.
   </p>
   
   <p>We have Just moved our camp. The place were we were first was a hill without a tree or any sort of shade. were we are now there are plenty of shade trees so that we are very comfortable. I am
      Just as well and hearty as can be I have slept out in the rain and on the ground but
      have not felt a bit the worse for it so I think I can go through like a book. When
      we first came here our camp was fired into for three or four nights in succession
      &nbsp;there were four or five shots fired each night and we could hear the balls whiz through
      the camp but no one was struck. I and half a dozen others were sent out to scout about and see
      what we could find &nbsp;we took our pistols and India rubber blankets and lay down in
      the grass about 200 yards from each other (the place were we are is about like Bedford) &nbsp;we were out two nights and brought in about a dozen
      chaps but they were all let go as there was nothing against them but hanging around
      the camp. I and two others were sent out the other day to arest a secession soldier from Harpers Ferry who it is suposed came on here as a spy. We went out in the city &nbsp;the chap that gave us the information
      shewed us the house and we went in and took him and brought him to camp &nbsp;he was sent
      to Fort McHenry the same day to be tried for a spy. This city is a regular secession
      place &nbsp;as we walk through the streets in the city the Women and children make a regular practice of saying as we pass them hurah for Jeff Davis &nbsp;the men dont say anything but you can see by the looks of the most of them that they dont like us at all. This city was placed under Marshal law yesterday and the celebrated
      Marshal Kane<sup><a href="#duk.00313_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> was arested and sent to the Fort. It kicked up quite an excitement in the city but they did not
      go any further than to stand on the corners and growl. It would not have been well
      for them to have made any row as there are about 8000 Troops encamped about here with
      a Splendid Battery of Artilery of 8 peices &nbsp;the Batery and two of the regiments are from Massachusets and they would like very mutch to get square for the afair on the 19th of April.<sup><a href="#duk.00313_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Well Mother the three Months is going fast and I shall soon be with you again. I see some very foolish articles in the papers about us sutch as not haveing any thing to eat for 36 hours and being almost naked but you must not believe any
      thing of the kind as we are as well off as we could expect<sup><a href="#duk.00313_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &nbsp;You speak in your letter of sending me on some Money. &nbsp;We expect to get our pay
      from Government in the course of a few days but if we do not I have enough to last
      me untill I get home. Mother you need not wory about me at all as I am not in want of anything and I dont believe we shal see any fighting at all. I was sent out on a scout again last night &nbsp;I went all around
      outside of the picket guard and down in the city but after ten O Clock it was as quiet
      as Brooklyn &nbsp;Well good bye Mother &nbsp;give my love to all and let me hear from you again
      right away.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00313_n100">1. On April 19, 1861—shortly
      after the firing on Fort Sumter—George Whitman enlisted for one hundred days in
      the Thirteenth Regiment of the New York State Militia, which was commanded by
      Colonel Abel Smith. This regiment was first stationed at Annapolis, Maryland,
      from April 23, 1861, to June 16, 1861, when its encampment was shifted to an
      area adjacent to Baltimore. As his letter reflects, the majority of citizens
      there held secessionist sympathies.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00313_n2">2. George Procter Kane
      (1817–1878) was the marshal of police in Baltimore. When the city was
      placed under martial law by General Butler, Kane resisted the order to surrender
      the city's arms and was arrested for protecting contraband traffic in arms and
      for being the head of a police force hostile to the United States
      Government.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00313_n3">3. The Sixth Regiment of
      Massachusetts was attacked by angry crowds in Baltimore as the troops attempted
      to pass through the city. Four of its number were killed and many others
      wounded.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00313_n4">4. In a letter to George
      dated , from Brooklyn, Walt Whitman
      wrote: "There have been so many accounts of shameful negligence, or worse, in
      the commissariat of your reg't. that there must be <em>something</em> in it—notwithstanding you speak very lightly of the
      complaints in your letters. The <em>Eagle</em>, of course, makes
      the worst of it, every day, to stop men from enlisting" (<em>The
         Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 1:56–57).<a href="#r4">[back]
