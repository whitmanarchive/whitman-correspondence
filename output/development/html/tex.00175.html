   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00175_n8">1. This letter dates to May
      23, 1866. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter's mailing to May 24, 1866,
      and Edwin Haviland Miller did not include the letter in his calendar of
      letters (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:377). Bucke's date may be
      derived from the envelope in which the letter was enclosed. The second page
      of the letter has the note "wensday" in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand.
      That note may date the letter's composition to May 23, 1866, which fell on
      Wednesday in 1866.<br><br>
      As the information in the letter is otherwise scant, some support for year
      1866 is provided by eliminating the previous and subsequent years according
      to contextual hints. The years 1864 and 1865 can be excluded because George
      Washington Whitman's army concerns would have been present in a letter of
      those years. The years 1867 and 1868 can be excluded also. If the former, it
      would be unusual for Louisa not to mention Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's
      recent departure for St. Louis, which raised housing concerns for Louisa in
      May 1867. The latter year (1868) can be eliminated based on Louisa's
      expressed hopes for a visit from Walt Whitman. She would not have expected a
      visit in 1868 because Walt on April 23, 1868 promised a visit to Brooklyn, a
      visit that extended from May 4 to May 17. On the other hand, Louisa's
      mentions of Brooklyn Water Works engineers Joseph Phineas Davis and Louis
      Probasco and her references to the family of her deceased son Andrew Jackson
      Whitman are consistent with the year 1866—and probably consistent with
      a Water Works public relations disaster in early May 1866.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n3">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="tex.00175_n13">3. Walt Whitman's May
      20–23?, 1866 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant. Edwin
      Haviland Miller did not list this lost letter from Walt (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:369). Walt took an extended vacation to Brooklyn in August,
      but he may have visited shortly after his mother and Thomas Jefferson Whitman's
      family moved to 840 Pacific Street in early May 1866.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00175_n10">5. James "Jimmy" Whitman,
      Louisa's "little Jim," was the son of Walt Whitman's brother Andrew Jackson
      Whitman (1827–1863) and Andrew's wife Nancy McClure Whitman. For more on
      Andrew's family, see Jerome M. Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> (Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975), 13–14.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00175_n3">6. Andrew Whitman, Jr.
      (1864–1868), the son of Walt Whitman's brother Andrew Jackson Whitman
      (1827–1863) and Andrew's wife Nancy McClure Whitman, was born after his
      father's death. Andrew died in 1868 after he was struck in the street by a
      brewery wagon. For Walt's response to the death of Andrew, Jr., see his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">7. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">8. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00175_n6">9. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      spelling "perbasco" probably refers to Louis Probasco, an employee at the
      Brooklyn Water Works (see Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). The
      Whitmans had two other acquaintances named Probasco—Samuel R. Probasco
      (1833–1910), an employee at the Brooklyn Water Works from 1856 to 1868 and
      an assistant engineer in the Department of City Works, and Joe Probasco, a
      soldier mentioned both in Jeff's  letter to Walt and in Walt's  letter to Louisa.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00175_n9">10. The line is not clear but
      probably reads "for one the hot concern." During a tour of the Brooklyn Water
      Works in early May 1866, commissioners witnessed outdoor toilets and drainage
      ditches that discharged into the Ridgewood Reservoir, which supplied drinking
      water. If Probasco lost his position, he may have been removed because of public
      complaint about the "hot concern" ("The Ridgewood Water," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, May 5, 1866, 4). This surmise remains
      speculative as the transcription is questionable, and no external source
      confirms Probasco's discharge. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman may report rumors from
      the Water Works engineers.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">11. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r11">[back]

   <p id="tex.00175_n16">12. Only the first three
      letters of the word "seem" are visible in the image or page. The letter is
      pasted into a manuscript book, and the final letters on the edge closest to the
      binding in the page image are often obscured. Most of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      manuscript letters in the bound volume entitled <em>Walt Whitman:
         A Series of Thirteen Letters from His Mother to Her Son</em>, held at the
      Harry Ransom Center, have obscured text on at least one page. Text from this
      page was recorded based on an examination of the physical volume, which allowed
      more text to be recovered.<a href="#r12">[back]
