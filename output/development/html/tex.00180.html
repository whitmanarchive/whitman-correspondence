   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00180_n4">1. This letter dates to October
      5, 1871. The executors did not date this letter, and Edwin Haviland Miller did
      not list it in his calendar of letters (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:369). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "Oct 5," and based on her
      statements that she had visitors and that she planned to make a long-delayed
      trip to the post office tomorrow, the letter dates to 1871. A week earlier,
      Louisa had noted her irritation at the arrival of her daughter Mary Van Nostrand
      and family with "bag and baggage" just as she planned to go out to the post
      office (see her  letter to Walt
      Whitman). According to this letter, "our company is here yet," but Louisa
      planned to take her delayed trip to the post office tomorrow. Louisa's daughter
      Mary came to Brooklyn with husband Ansel and her two daughters Louisa and Mary
      Isadore "Minnie." Mary had requested a week-long visit for shopping in
      preparation for her daughter Minnie's approaching marriage in mid-October (see
      Louisa's  letter to
      Walt).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n3">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00180_n14">4. Adams Express, founded in
      the northeast in the 1840s, was a packet and letter service that spread
      nationally as a reliable alternative to the United States Post Office. Adams
      Express was noted for its trustworthiness and its guarantee of privacy for
      shippers, which made it a favorite for conveying material that was deemed
      valuable or otherwise called for discretion. The Whitmans used Adams Express to
      transfer larger sums of money both during and after the Civil War, but Walt
      Whitman generally sent Louisa Van Velsor Whitman smaller sums via the postal
      service. For the trust accorded to Adams Express, see Hollis Robbins, "Fugitive
      Mail: The Deliverance of Henry 'Box' Brown and Antebellum Postal Politics," <em>American Studies</em> 50.1/2 (2009), 12–13.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00180_n3">5. The company that is "here
      yet" is Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's daughter Mary Elizabeth Van Nostrand
      (1821–1899), her husband Ansel Van Nostrand, and their daughters Louisa
      and Mary Isadore "Minnie." The four used Louisa's Brooklyn residence as a home
      base for a full week of shopping in preparation for Minnie's upcoming marriage.
      For Louisa's anxiety regarding the Van Nostrands' planned visit, see her  letter to Walt Whitman.
      For her irritation at their arrival with "bag and baggage," see her  letter to Walt. Minnie married
      Leander Jay Young (1846–1937) on October 18, 1871. For the date of the
      marriage, see Gertrude A. Barber, compiler, "Marriages of Suffolk County, N. Y.
      Taken from the 'Republican Watchman': A Newspaper Published at Greenport, N. Y.
      Years 1871, 1872, 1873, 1874, 1875, 1876" (1950), 1:3,
