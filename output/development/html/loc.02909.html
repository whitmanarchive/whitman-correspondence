      <br></br><br></br>Dear W.W.  
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your good long letter Jan. 10—recd
      It's so cold I could'nt sleep this morn. Your
      letter alarms me for yr health, somewhat. I have decided to come on &amp; see you in a
      week or so.
      I will be very careful not to fatigue or bother you. I begin to see that it is
      useless to wait till you are free from other visitors. For Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> says he
      is coming on to see you too, &amp; you will always be more or less besieged. By
      coming on I could bring my MS with me, &amp; stay three days at least. There is no
      hurry about the MS, for Wilson<sup><a href="#loc.03316_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> does not want it of
      course on hand, until the subscribers' names mount up pretty cheerily. He is anxious
      to have it boomed up through, &amp; asks permission to announce it, wh. I have granted by this mail. I am revising the
      MS. for punctuation &amp; style.—Dr. B.<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> sends me word
      that he will send me a list of Whitmanites. I have already made out a long
      one—going over all my scraps &amp; records for the purpose 
   </p>
   
   <p>Our brilliant young fellow Rhys is booming on here. I assume the papa toward him a
      little. We are trying to rub the British bloom "off 'n him."  We go to Sanborn's<sup><a href="#n0915" id="r5">5</a></sup> at Concord Frid
      to dine, Sat to St. Botolph's<sup><a href="#n3098" id="r6">6</a></sup> club goes he &amp;c &amp;c. 
   </p>
   
   <p>He gets definite 'invite' to lecture 
      bef.

       club. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Farewell dear friend for to-day friend in the deepest sense. May we soon strike hands
      together!

   <p> P.S. I must stop &amp; roust up Rhys so he can read me his lecture to me before I go
      to work. Will send you my <u>Herald</u> article on him when
      it appears.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02904_n2">1. Based on the information
      provided in this letter, it was written in 1888. Whitman had misdated it in the
      first days of the new year.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03310_n1">2. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03316_n2">3. Frederick W. Wilson was a
      member of the Glasgow firm of Wilson &amp; McCormick that published the 1883
      British edition of <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0915">5. Franklin B. Sanborn
      (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
      he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
      the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
      reviewed <em>Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Boston
         Commonwealth</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00059.html">February 24, 1866</a>. He was editor of the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
      his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
      appeared without Sanborn's name in the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K. Walker,
      "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_206.html">Sanborn, Franklin Benjamin (Frank) (1831–1917)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n3098">6. The St. Botolph Club, founded in
      1880, was a well-known social club in Boston, named after Botwulf of Thorney,
      the patron saint of Boston, England. The club attracted many luminary figures,
      including Henry Cabot Lodge and John Boyle O'Reilly.<a href="#r6">[back]
