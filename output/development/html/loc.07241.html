   <p>I have been away two days—went Wednesday—wedding yesterday back today.
      Did some meter business<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> at same time. The wedding<sup><a href="#loc.07241_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> was a very pleasant one, both
      groom &amp; bride very jolly—everything went smoothly and we all had a good time—.
      The affair was very stilish—6 bridesmaids &amp;c &amp;c 
      Champaine
      
       breakfast. And all the
      rest of it—wedding presents very handsome and very numerous—Got back home at noon
      today and all
      afternoon we have been having "athletic sports" at the asylum.—quite a "big  time" attendants and
      patients taking part—we had over $100. worth of prizes and had a lot of fun. I
      suppose the books are getting on? I hope you will settle down to the notion of
      issuing the big book<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r4">4</a></sup> <u>yourself</u> without the intermediary of
      any publisher—print 400 or 500 copies—get them up in all ways in first
      class style—number each—sell for $10. Advertise in the "N.B."<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r5">5</a></sup> and
      perhaps in "Critic" &amp; "Pall Mall Gazette"— let Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r6">6</a></sup> do all the work except autographing—make it a solid
      remembrance of yourself for your friends—make it as <u>personal</u> as possible

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07241_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: LONDON | [illegible] | SP 15
      | 88 | CANADA; CAMDEN, N.J. | SEP | 17 | [illegible]PM | 1888 | REC'D.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07230_n2">2. Bucke and his brother-in-law
      William John Gurd were designing a gas and fluid meter to be patented in Canada
      and sold in England.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07241_n2">3. Bucke is referring to the
      recent marriage of Mrs. Bucke's nephew, the lawyer Frederick Kittermaster to
      Louisa Helen Pardee (1865–1950), daughter of Timothy Blair Pardee
      (1830–1889), a Canadian lawyer and politician.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">4. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">5. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">6. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
