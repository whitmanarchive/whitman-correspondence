   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Horace Wentworth was Thayer and Eldridge's former
      boss who later acted as the firm's creditor. Wentworth received the plates of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> as compensation for his financial
      loss when Thayer and Eldridge went bankrupt in 1861. W.W. Thayer informed
      Whitman of this change in ownership on . For Wentworth's offer to sell the plates of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and <em>Leaves of Grass Imprints</em> to
      Whitman, see his  letter.
