   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was sorry the article about the Camden School seemed to you unkind in its reference
      to your health. I shall have a paragraph within a day or two, which will I think relieve
      you of the idea that we had any such intention.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I sincerely hope you are getting better, and will soon be out of the woods.</p>

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Whitelaw Reid (1837–1912) was the editor of
      the <em>New York Tribune</em> from 1872 to 1905 and later American
      ambassador to France (1889–1892) and England (1905–1912). He met
      Whitman in the hospitals during the Civil War. Of his relations with the poet,
      Reid later observed: "No one could fail then [during the War] to admire his zeal
      and devotion, and I am afraid that at first my regard was for his character
      rather than his poetry. It was not till long after 'The Leaves of Grass' period
      that his great verses on the death of Lincoln conquered me completely." See
      Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and Friend</em>
      (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 213, and <em>Studies in
         Bibliography</em>, ed. Fredson Bowers (Charlottesville, VA: Bibliographical
      Society of the University of Virginia, 1956), 8:242–249.
