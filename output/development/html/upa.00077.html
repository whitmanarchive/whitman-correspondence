   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00077_n1">1. Herbert's letter is not
      known. Apparently Whitman referred to Anne Gilchrist's letter of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00077_n2">2. On January 26 Mrs.
      Gilchrist asked Louisa Whitman for an old suit of Whitman's which would be of
      use to her son for a painting entitled "The Poet's Tea Party," in which appeared
      Whitman, Mrs. Gilchrist, Grace, and Herbert; see Amy Haslam Dowe, "A Child's
      Memories of the Whitmans" (unpublished). See also the letter from Anne Gilchrist
      to Walt Whitman of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
