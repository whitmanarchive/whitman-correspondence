   <p>Condition still hopeful, &amp; (though tedious as ever, &amp; with relapses &amp; bad spells,)
      still seem <em>decidedly</em> 
      to gain more than loseâ€”I have written to the As. Am quite comfortable to-day.

      This letter's envelope bears the address, "Mrs. E. M. O'Connor, | 1015 O
      street, near 11th N. W. | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Apr
      | 17(?)| N.J.; Carrier | 18 | (?)| 8 AM."<br><br>
      The year is verified by the reference to Burroughs' visit mentioned in
      Whitman's  letter to Peter Doyle
      and in Whitman's  letter to
      Rudolf Schmidt.<a href="#r1">[back]
