   <p> I send you a nice letter from O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup>

   <p> His <u>rabies</u> (nor is it without foundation) against
      McCaulay, still continues as
      you see<sup><a href="#loc.05890_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>— 
   </p>
   
   <p> O'Connor is a "<u>brick</u>"— 
   </p>
   
   <p> I trust you are moving on <u>the enemies work</u>, in regard to
      the <u>Springfield Repub</u> article.<sup><a href="#loc.05890_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> They seem so <u>genuinely</u> anxious to get it I wd like to send it off this
      week. If you come around 7 or 8 pm—this evening there is enough "four mark"
      for two bouncing good punches

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Matlock Scovel began to
      practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War he was in the New Jersey
      legislature, and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned actively for Horace
      Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S. Treasury during Chester
      Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home
      for Sunday breakfast, as he did on December 2 and 9, 1877 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a description of
      these breakfasts, see <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed.
      William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel,
      see George R. Prowell's <em>The History of Camden County, New
         Jersey</em> (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05890_n2">1. Whitman crossed out this
      letter and wrote a series of notes on the back.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05890_n3">3. O'Connor had attacked
      British essayist Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800–1859), calling him a
      "brilliant knave," for his "calumny" about Francis Bacon, one of O'Connor's
      idols. Macaulay's controversial essay about Bacon was published in the Edinburgh
      Review in 1837. See Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.85.html">Monday, July 1, 1889</a>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05890_n1">4. James Matlack Scovel's "Walt
      Whitman" finally appeared in the <em>Springfield Republican</em>
      on June 16, 1885—partially authored by Whitman himself and after months of
      negotiating between Scovel and the poet.<a href="#r4">[back]
