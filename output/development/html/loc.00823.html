      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I write you a few lines, as I know you feel anxious these times—I suppose the New
      York papers must have it in this morning that the Army of the Potomac has made a move,
      &amp; has crossed the Rapidan river<sup><a href="#loc.00823_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—at any rate that is the case—as near as I can learn about Burnside's army, that lies in the rear of the Army of the Potomac, (from Warrenton,
      Virginia, &amp; so to Rappahannock river &amp; up toward Manassas)—it still appears to be
      kept as a reserve, &amp; for emergencies &amp;c. I have not heard any thing from the 51st.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, of course you got my letter of Tuesday, 3d, with the letter from George dated Bristoe station—I have writ to George since, and addressed the letter Warrenton,
      Va., or elsewhere, thinking he might get it—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, the idea is entertained quite largely here that the rebel army will retreat
      to Richmond, as it is well known that Grant is very strong, (most folks say too strong
      for Lee)—I suppose you know we menace them almost as much from up Fortress Monroe as we do
      from the Rapidan—Butler &amp; W F Smith<sup><a href="#loc.00823_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> are down there with at least fifty or sixty thousand men, &amp; will move up simultaneously
      with Grant—the occasion is serious, &amp; anxious, but somehow I am full of hope—&amp; feel
      that we shall take Richmond—(I hope to go there yet before the hot weather is past)—dear
      mother, I hope you are well &amp; little California—love to Jeff &amp; Mat &amp; all—

   <p>Mother, you ought to get this letter Saturday forenoon, as it will be in N Y by sunrise
      Saturday 7th—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother,<sup><a href="#loc.00823_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> the poor soldier with diarrhea is still living, but O what a looking object, death
      would be a boon to him, he cannot last many hours—Cunningham, the Ohio boy with leg
      amputated at thigh, has picked up beyond expectation, now looks altogether like getting
      well—the hospitals are very full—I am very well indeed—pretty warm here to–day—

   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, just as I put this letter in the mail there is an extra out here that Grant
      has advanced his army or a portion of it to the region of the Chancellorsville battle
      of just a year ago, &amp; has either flanked Lee, as they call it, (got in on his army
      between him &amp; Richmond)—or else that Lee has hurried back, or is hurrying back to
      Richmond—
   </p>
   
   <p>Whether there is any thing in this story or not, I cannot tell—the city is full of
      rumors &amp; this may be one of them—the government is not in receipt of any information
      to-day—Grant has taken the reins entirely in his own hands—he is really dictator at
      present—we shall hear something important within two or three days—Grant is very secretive
      indeed—he bothers himself very little about sending news even to the President or
      Stanton—time only can develope his plans—I still think <em>he is going to take Richmond &amp; soon</em>, (but I may be mistaken as I have been in past)—Well, dearest mother, keep up good
      courage, good bye for present—I wish you would write soon—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00823_n1">1. Grant was engaged in the
      Battle of the Wilderness and was about to achieve a major victory. On May 9, the
      <em>New York Times</em> reported: "GLORIOUS NEWS | Defeat and
      Retreat | of Lee Army. | Two Days Battle in Virginia."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00823_n2">2. Benjamin Franklin Butler
      (1818–1893), controversial Massachusetts politician and controversial
      administrator of New Orleans until his removal on December 16, 1862, was in
      command of the Army of the James in 1863 and 1864. William Farrar Smith
      (1824–1903) was one of Butler's general officers. He attacked Petersburg
      in the following month, but his delays led to his loss of command on July 19,
      1864.<a href="#r2">[back]

         Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902],
      10 vols., 6:230), with minor changes; "pretty warm" in the last line, for
      example, became "Hot here to–day."<a href="#r3">[back]
