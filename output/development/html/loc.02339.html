   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Hutchinson (1856–1938) was a writer and educator, teaching at Northumbria University
      and the Pegswood school. He published 
      a book of verse, <em>Ballades and other Rhymes of a Country Bookworm</em> (1888). He
      was also a collector of first editions and publications by notable writers, and the
      items in the collection that had not been sold previously at auction were later donated
      by Hutchinson's descendants
      to Preston Park Museum and Grounds (Charlotte Barro, "Man with Lifelong Love Affair
      with Literature," <em>Morpeth Herald</em>, January 1, 2016).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02339_n1">1. These lines from the poem "Not Knowing" have been attributed to Mary Gardiner Brainard
      (1837–1905), a 
      writer of religious poetry. Philip Paul Bliss set the lines to music as a hymn in
      the 1870s. Whitman quoted parts of these lines in <em>Specimen
         Days and Collect</em>, noting that his source was "Prof. Huxley in a late lecture."<a href="#r1">[back]
