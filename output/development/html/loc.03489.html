   </p>
   
   <p>As one of the wide circle of the friends whom you have
      never seen or heard of, I take the liberty of addressing you a word of thanks
      for the pleasure with which I have read your "November Boughs,"<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r2">2</a></sup> and of sending
      you two articles, upon the subject which I have recently published. No one knows
      better than I how little the opinion of the world can matter to you one way or
      the other, but I have 
       thought that it
      might afford you a moment of satisfaction to know how kindly some of us out here
      think of you, and I am sure that it affords me much more than that to give this
      personal expression to my feeling.

   <p></span><span class="handshift">Walt Whitman.</p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">The time is past when Walt Whitman could be dismissed
      with a smile or a sneer, and he has already taken his place in the foremost rank
      of our writers. The public has been slow to recognize the power and value of his
      work, but no public, possessed of any degree of intelligence, could long hold
      out against the verdict rendered in his favor by the consensus of English and
      American critics. No writer of ordinary powers could win the approval and praise
      of such men (to name but a few) as Tennyson,<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r3">3</a></sup> Swinburne,<sup><a href="#n0610" id="r4">4</a></sup> W. M. Rossetti,<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r5">5</a></sup> J. A. Symonds<sup><a href="#n0615" id="r6">6</a></sup> and E. C. Stedman,<sup><a href="#n1043" id="r7">7</a></sup> and this praise and
      this approval have been bestowed by them in generous measure. It will appear
      then, at the present day, neither paradox nor extravagance to say that "November
      Boughs" (Philadelphia: David McKay)<sup><a href="#n4983" id="r8">8</a></sup> is an important
      permanent contribution to American literature.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">The contents of this suggestively named volume are
      diversified. There are some twenty pages of poems, half a dozen essays in
      literary criticism, several miscellaneous prose papers, and much fragmentary
      reminiscence of a varied and well-spent life. Of most interest, perhaps, is the
      "Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads," which serves as the volume's preface. In
      this admirable paper the veteran poet, with the objective vision of age, takes a
      long retrospective survey of his activities, admitting the reader more closely
      than before into the secret of his endeavor, and giving clear and forcible
      expression to the aims for whose accomplishment he has striven. "At the age of
      31 to 33," he tell us, he found himself possessed by an overmastering impulse.
      "This was a feeling or ambition to articulate and faithfully express in literary
      and poetic form, and uncompromisingly, my own physical, emotional, moral,
      intellectual and esthetic Personality, in the midst of, and tallying the
      momentous spirit and facts of its immediate days, and of current
      America—and to exploit that Personality, identified with place and date,
      in a far more candid and comprehensive sense than any hitherto poem or book."
      The outcome of this ambition was the collection of pieces known collectively as
      "Leaves of Grass" and the prose papers also put forth from time to time. "The
      best comfort of the whole business is that, unstopp'd and unwarped by any
      influence outside the soul within me, I have had my say entirely my own way, and
      put it unerringly on record." This is what he tells us, with a pride as
      pardonable as the occasion for its exhibition is rare even among writers of more
      than usual sincerity and earnestness of purpose. In another place the feeling of
      pride leads to this exclamation: "My Book and I—what a period we have
      presumed to span! those thirty years from 1850 to 1880—and America in
      them! Proud, proud indeed may we be if we have culled enough of that period in
      its own spirit to worthily waft a few live breaths of it to the future!"
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">Upon the two matters in which Whitman's work has
      mainly given offence—its disregard respectively of the conventional
      requirements of morality and of literary form—this introduction is clear
      and outspoken. Concerning the latter of these matters we read: "I know well
      enough, too, that in respect to pictorial talent, dramatic situations, and
      especially in verbal melody and all the conventional technique of poetry, not
      only the divine works, that to-day stand ahead in the world's reading, but
      dozens more, transcend (some of them immeasurably transcend) all I have done or
      could do. But it seemed to me, as the objects in Nature, the themes of
      estheticism, and all special exploitations of the mind and soul, involve not
      only their own inherent quality, but the quality, just as inherent and
      important, of <em>their point of view</em>, the time had come to
      reflect all themes and things, old and new, in the lights thrown on them by the
      advent of America and democracy—to chant those themes through the
      utterance of one not only the grateful and reverent legatee of the past, but the
      born child of the New World—to illustrate all through the genesis and
      ensemble of to-day; and that such illustration and ensemble are the chief
      demands of America's prospective imaginative literature." While this plea may by
      no means be accepted as justifying Whitman's literary form, which has faults of
      which his defective sense does not allow him to dream, it is valuable as a
      statement of his aim in writing, and for its hearty recognition of the
      conventional types of excellence in literary composition. This recognition,
      indeed, finds further and ample expression in the papers on Tennyson, Burns and
      Shakspeare which are given in the present volume. Of the real purpose of
      literature, whether conventional or not in form, Whitman is substantially at one
      with all the great writers from Shakspeare downwards. "I say the profoundest
      service that poems or any other writings can do for their reader is not merely
      to satisfy the intellect or supply something polished and interesting, nor even
      to depict great passions or persons and events, but to fill him with vigorous
      and clean manliness, religiousness, and give him <em>good
         heart</em> as a radical possession and habit." These words are as noble as
      they are profoundly true.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">The other matter, brought into prominence by the
      moralists, who have made themselves mainly responsible for the tardiness of the
      recognition bestowed upon Whitman's work, is thus met, and the opinion is
      enforced by years of careful reflection. "From another point of view, 'Leaves of
      Grass' is avowedly the song of Sex and Amativeness, and even
      Animality—though meanings that do not usually go along with these words
      are behind all, and will duly emerge; and all are sought to be lifted into a
      different light and atmosphere. Of this feature, intentionally palpable in a few
      lines, I shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath
      of life to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been
      left unwritten were those lines omitted. Difficult as it will be, it has become,
      in my opinion, imperative to achieve a shifted attitude from superior men and women
      toward the thought and fact of sexuality as an element in character,
      personality, the emotions, and a theme in literature. I am not going to argue
      the question by itself; it does not stand by itself. . . . In respect to
      editions of 'Leaves of Grass' in time to come (if there should be such), I take
      occasion now to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate
      renewals of thirty years, and I hereby prohibit, as far as word of mine can do,
      any elision of them." 
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">The few pages of poetry included within this volume
      should be reckoned with Whitman's most remarkable work. They exhibit, of course,
      the peculiarities of diction and the general formlessness of the "Leaves of
      Grass." The reader who is not prepared to accept the writer's theories, or,
      rather, who is not willing to acquiesce in them for the time being, will not be
      appealed to by these "Sands at Seventy." Admitting the peculiarities as a
      constant and consistent factor, there is much that is both striking and fine.
      Take, for exmaple, this epigram on "The Bravest Soldiers:"
   </p>
   </span><span class="handshift">
   <span class="indent">"Brave, brave were the soldiers (high-named to-day) who lived through the
      night;</span><br>
   <span class="indent">But the bravest press'd to the front and fell, unnamed, unkown."</span><br>
   
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">Here is a touch of nature that is admirable in its
      thought and feeling:
   </p>
   </span><span class="handshift"><span class="indent">"Simple and fresh and fair from
      Winter's close emerging,</span><br>
   <span class="indent">As if no artifice of fashion, business, politics, had ever been.</span><br>
   <span class="indent">Forth from its sunny nook of shelter'd grass—innocent, golden, calm as
      the dawn,</span><br>
   <span class="indent">The Spring's first dandelion shows its trustful face."</span><br>
   
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">The following fragment is based upon an incident of
      the Greely expedition—the hearing of a solitary snow-bird's song by the
      explorers in 83 degrees of north latitude:
   </p>
   </span><span class="handshift">
   <span class="indent">"Of that blithe throat of thine from Arctic bleak and blank,</span><br>
   <span class="indent">I'll mind the lesson, solitary bird—let me, too, welcome chilling
      drifts,</span><br>
   <span class="indent">E'en the profoundest chill, as now—a torpid pulse, a brain
      unnerv'd,</span><br>
   <span class="indent">Old age land-lock'd within its Winter bay—(cold, cold, O cold!)</span><br>
   <span class="indent">These snowy hairs, my feeble arm, my frozen feet,</span><br>
   <span class="indent">For them thy faith, thy role I take, and grave it to the last;</span><br>
   <span class="indent">Not summer's zones alone—not chants of youth, or south's warm tides
      alone,</span><br>
   <span class="indent">But held by sluggish toes, pack'd in the northern ice, the cumulus of
      years,</span><br>
   <span class="indent">These with gay heart I also sing."</span><br>
   
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">There is something haunting about these lines, with
      whatever species of composition we may choose to class them, and this haunting
      quality appears upon every one of the too few pages which contain the poet's
      latest songs. At his best, Whitman has a genius for style and for apt expression
      of thought which allies him with the greater poets and insures for him the
      recognition and the respect of the future.

      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0610">4. Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) was a
      British poet, critic, playwright, and novelist. He was also one of Whitman's
      earliest English admirers. At the conclusion of <em>William Blake:
         A Critical Essay</em> (1868), 300–303, Swinburne pointed out
      similarities between Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly
      Rocking" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the
      most sweet and sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world." His
      famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America" is included in <em>Songs
         before Sunrise</em> (1871). For the story of Swinburne's veneration of
      Whitman and his later recantation, see two essays by Terry L. Meyers, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00740.pdf">Swinburne and Whitman: Further Evidence</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0522">5. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0615">6. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n1043">7. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt

      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
