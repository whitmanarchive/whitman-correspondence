      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter with Han's I have sent to George, though whether it will find him or not
      I cannot tell, as I think the 51st must be away down at Vicksburgh—I have not had
      a word from George yet—Mother, I have had quite an attack of sore throat &amp; distress
      in my head for some days past, up to last night, but to-day I feel nearly all right
      again. I have been about the city same as usual, nearly—to the Hospitals, &amp;c, I mean—I
      am told that I hover too much over the beds of the hospitals, with fever &amp; putrid
      wounds, &amp;c. One soldier, brought here about fifteen days ago, very low with typhoid
      fever, Livingston Brooks,<sup><a href="#nyp.00183_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Co B 17th Penn Cavalry, I have particularly stuck to, as I found him in what appeared
      to be a dying condition, from negligence, &amp; a horrible journey of about forty miles,
      bad roads &amp; fast driving—&amp; then after he got here, as he is a simple country boy,
      very shy &amp; silent, &amp; made no complaint, they neglected him—I found him something like
      I found John Holmes<sup><a href="#nyp.00183_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> last winter—I called the doctor's attention to him, shook up the nurses, had him
      bathed in spirits, gave him lumps of ice, &amp; ice to his head, he had a fearful bursting
      pain in his head, &amp; his body was like fire—he was very quiet, a very sensible boy,
      old fashioned—he did not want to die, &amp; I had to lie to him without stint, for he
      thought I knew everything, &amp; I always put in of course that what I told him was exactly
      the truth, &amp; that if he got really dangerous I would tell him &amp; not conceal it.
   </p>
   
   <p>The rule is to remove bad fever patients out from the main wards to a tent by themselves,
      &amp; the doctor told me he would have to be removed. I broke it gently to him, but the
      poor boy got it immediately in his head that he was marked with death, &amp; was to be
      removed on that account—it had a great effect upon him, &amp; although I told the truth
      this time it did not have as good a result as my former fibs—I persuaded the doctor
      to let him remain—for three days he lay just about an even chance, go or stay, with
      a little leaning toward the first—But, mother, to make a long story short, he is now
      out of any immediate danger—he has been perfectly rational throughout—begins to taste
      a little food, (for a week he eat nothing, I had to compel him to take a quarter of
      an orange, now &amp; then)—&amp; I will say, whether any one calls it pride or not, that if
      he <em>does</em> get up &amp; around again, it's me that saved his life. Mother, as I have said in former
      letters, you can have no idea how these sick &amp; dying youngsters cling to a fellow,
      &amp; how fascinating it is, with all its hospital surroundings of sadness &amp; scenes of
      repulsion &amp; death.
   </p>
   
   <p>In this same hospital, Armory Square, where this cavalry boy is, I have about fifteen
      or twenty particular cases I see much too, some of them as much as him—there are two
      from East Brooklyn, George Monk,<sup><a href="#nyp.00183_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Co A 78th N Y, &amp; Stephen Redgate,<sup><a href="#nyp.00183_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> (his mother is a widow in E[ast] B[rooklyn], I have written her,) both are pretty
      badly wounded—both are youngsters under 19—O mother, there seems to me as I go through
      these rows of cots, as if it was too bad to accept these <em>children</em>, to subject them to such premature experiences—I devote myself much to Armory Square
      Hospital because it contains by far the worst cases, most repulsive wounds, has the
      most suffering &amp; most need of consolation—I go every day without fail, &amp; often at
      night—sometimes stay very late—no one interferes with me, guards, doctors, nurses,
      nor any one—I am let to take my own course.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, mother, I suppose you folks think we are in a somewhat dubious position here
      in Washington, with Lee in strong force almost between us &amp; you northerners<sup><a href="#nyp.00183_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Well it does look ticklish, if the rebs cut the connection, then there will be fun—The
      reb cavalry come quite near us, dash in &amp; steal wagon trains, &amp;c—It would be funny
      if they should come some night to the President's country house, (soldier's home,)
      where he goes out to sleep every night—it is in the same direction as their saucy
      raid last Sunday—[Mr. Lincoln passes here (14th st) every evening on his way out—I
      noticed him last evening about ½ past 6, he was in his barouche, two horses, guarded
      by about thirty cavalry. The barouche comes first under a slow trot, driven by one
      man in the box, no servant or footman beside—the cavalry all follow closely after
      with a lieutenant at their head—I had a good view of the President last evening—he
      looks more careworn even than usual—his face with deep cut lines, seams, &amp; his <em>complexion gray</em>, through very dark skin, a curious looking man, very sad—I said to a lady who was
      looking with me, "Who can see that man without losing all wish to be sharp upon him
      personally? Who can say he has not a good soul?" The lady assented, although she is
      almost vindictive on the course of the administration, (thinks it wants nerve &amp;c.,
      the usual complaint).<sup><a href="#nyp.00183_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> The equipage is rather shabby, horses indeed almost what my friends the Broadway
      drivers would call <em>old plugs</em>. The President dresses in plain black clothes, cylinder hat—he was alone yesterday—As
      he came up, he first drove over to the house of the Sec[retary] of War, on K st about
      300 feet from here, sat in his carriage while Stanton came out &amp; had a 15 minutes
      interview with him (I can see from my window)—&amp; then wheeled around, &amp; slowly trotted
      around the corner &amp; up Fourteenth st., the cavalry after him—I really think it would
      be safer for him just now to stop at the White House, but I expect he is too proud
      to abandon the former custom—] Then about an hour after, we had a large cavalry regiment
      pass, with blankets, arms, &amp;c, on the war march over the same track—the reg't was
      very full, over a thousand, indeed thirteen or fourteen hundred—it was an old reg't,
      veterans, <em>old fighters</em>, young as they were—they were preceded by a fine mounted band of sixteen, (about
      ten bugles, the rest cymbals &amp; drums)—I tell you, mother, it made every thing ring—made
      my heart leap, they played with a will—then <em>the accompaniment</em>—the sabres rattled on a thousand men's sides—they had pistols, their heels spurred—handsome
      American young men, (I make no acc't of any other)—rude uniforms, well worn, but good
      cattle, prancing—all good riders, full of the devil, nobody shaved, all very sunburnt.
      The regimental officers (splendidly mounted, but just as roughly drest as the men) came immediately after the band, then company after company, with each
      its officers at its head—the tramping of so many horses (there is a good hard turnpike)—then
      a long train of men with led horses, mounted negroes, &amp; a long long string of baggage wagons, each with four horses—&amp; then a strong rear
      guard—I tell you it had the look of real war—noble looking fellows—a man looks &amp; feels
      so proud on a good horse, &amp; armed—They are off toward the region of Lee's (supposed)
      rendezvous, toward the Susquehannah, for the great anticipated battle—Alas, how many
      of these healthy handsome rollicking young men will lie cold in death, before the
      apples ripe in the orchards<sup><a href="#nyp.00183_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, it is curious &amp; stirring here, in some respects—smaller or larger bodies of
      troops are moving continually—many just well men are turned out of the hospitals—I
      am where I see a good deal of them—There are getting to be <em>many black troops</em>—there is one very good reg't here black as tar—they go armed, have the regular uniform—they
      submit to no nonsense—others are constantly forming—it is getting to be a common sight—they
      press them. [<em>Incomplete</em>]

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00183_n1">1. Eventually Brooks
      recovered and, after a furlough, returned to his regiment. He wrote to Whitman
      on November 21, 1863, from Culpepper, Virginia. (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg
      Collection, New York Public Library); Whitman's reply of December 19, 1863 is
      lost (Charles I. Glicksberg, <em>Walt Whitman and the Civil
         War</em> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1933], 140).
      Whitman noted the case in his diary (Glicksberg, <em>Walt Whitman
         and the Civil War</em> [1933], 149–150).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00183_n3">3. In July, 1863, Whitman
      recorded the case of George W. Monk in his hospital notes: "Brooklyn boy—father
      Wm D. Monk, Brooklyn E[ast] D[istrict]—gun shot wound in head—feet benumbed—fine
      manly quiet boy" (Glicksberg, <em>Walt Whitman and the Civil
         War</em> [1933], 149). The father was listed as a roof maker in the
      Directory of 1861–1862, as a ropemaker in 1865.<a href="#r3">[back]

      Seventy-eighth Regiment; see <em>A Record of the Commissioned
         Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers, and Privates, of the Regiments Which
         Were Organized in the State of New York and Called into the Service of the
         United States to Assist in Suppressing the Rebellion</em> (Albany: Comstock
      and Cassidy, 1864), 3: 229.<a href="#r4">[back]

         York Times</em> reported that Lee was in Pennsylvania, at or near
      Chambersburg.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00183_n6">6. Perhaps in part Whitman
      was directing these words to Jeff, who was no admirer of Lincoln. On May 27,
      1863, apparently in answer to a lost letter, Jeff wrote: "I cannot agree with
      you, Walt, in relation to the President. I think that he is not a man for the
      times, not big enough. He dont seem to have even force enough to stop bickerings
      between his own Cabinet and Generals nor force enough to do as he thinks best. .
      . . No, A. L. is not the man and I hardly know if we have one that is equal to
      the thing." Jeff returned to the subject on June 13, 1863: "Well, Walt, you and
      I cannot agree in regard to 'Uncle Abe.' . . . He lends himself to the
      speculators, in all the ways that it can be done. He says 'yes' to the last man
      or 'No' as that man wants him to. Everything he does reminds me of an old woman"
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection).<a href="#r6">[back]

      "Come Up from the Fields Father," which appeared in <em>Drum-Taps</em>, 39: "Lo, 'tis autumn; . . . / Where apples ripe in the
      orchards hang, and grapes on the trellis'd vines . . ." <a href="#r7">[back]
