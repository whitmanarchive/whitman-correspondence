   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00362_n1">1. This postcard bears
      the address, "Pete Doyle, | M st South, bet 4½ &amp; 6th, | Washington,
      D. C." It is postmarked: "Camden | (?) | 19 | N.J."<br><br>This and Whitman's
       letter to Doyle were
      written on Fridays, if the year is correct. In both notes Whitman seems to
      refer to the serious relapse in February 1875. The latter card alludes to
      Doyle's new, but temporary, position in Baltimore; see also Whitman's  letter to Doyle.<a href="#r1">[back]
