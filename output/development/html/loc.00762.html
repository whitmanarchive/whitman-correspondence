      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Jeff must have got a letter<sup><a href="#loc.00762_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> from me yesterday, containing George's last letter.<sup><a href="#loc.00762_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> The news of your sickness, and the strange silence of Han made me feel somewhat gloomy.
      I wrote to George yesterday, conveying the news—and to-day I have sent him another
      letter, with much more comfortable news, for I was so glad to hear from Han, (her
      letter, enclosed in Jeff's, received this morning) that I wrote him right away, and
      sent Han's letter.<sup><a href="#loc.00762_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I am quite in hopes George will get a furlough—may-be my expectations are
      unfounded, but I almost count on it.<sup><a href="#loc.00762_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I am so glad this morning to hear you are no worse, but changed for the better—and
      dear sister Mat too, and sissy, I am so glad to think they are recovering.<sup><a href="#loc.00762_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Jeff's enclosure of $10 through Mr. Lane,<sup><a href="#loc.00762_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> from the young engineers, for the soldiers in hospitals, the most needy cases, came
      safe of course—I shall acknowledge it to Mr. Lane to-morrow. Mother, I have written
      so much about hospitals, that I will not write any in this letter.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have had bad weather enough here lately to most make up for the delightful weather
      we had for five weeks after I came from home.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I do hope you will be careful, and not get any relapse—and hope you will go
      on improving. Do you then think of getting new apartments, after the 1st of May? I
      suppose Jeff has settled about the lot<sup><a href="#loc.00762_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—it seems to me first rate as an investment—the kind of house to build is quite a
      consideration, (if any house,) I should build <em>a regular Irish shanty</em> myself, two rooms, and an end shed—I think that's luxury enough, since I have been
      down in the army.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, mother, I believe I will not fill out the sheet this time, as I want to go down
      without delay to the P. O. and send George's letter, and this one.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good bye, dear mother,</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00762_n1">1. Whitman's letter to Jeff
      is not extant. In a letter from ,
      Jeff mentioned that he had shown Whitman's "last letter" to Moses Lane, who
      thought it "was a clincher." Probably Lane borrowed the letter in order to aid
      his solicitation of funds for Whitman's hospital work.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00762_n2">2. From his camp near
      Falmouth, George had written to Whitman on , and , and to his
      mother on .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00762_n3">3. These letters are not
      known.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00762_n4">4. On , George vowed that if he did not
      receive a furlough, he would submit his resignation, "as it is hardly a fair
      shake for some to go home two or three times a year while others cant get away
      at all." On , he was still
      discouraged about the prospects for a leave.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00762_n5">5. On the day Whitman wrote
      this letter, Jeff reported that the three were recovering, and that "I think
      they all have had the worst colds that I know of" (see Jeff's letter from ).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00762_n6">6. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. Like Jeff, he collected money from his employees and
      friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter of , and later various sums which
      Whitman acknowledged in letters from ,
      , and . In his letter of , Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in the
      Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman wrote,
      obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of money,
      contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly
      through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted Whitman
      in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from , and ). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal welfare that on , he sent through Jeff $5 "for your
      own especial benefit."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00762_n7">7. On , Jeff wrote: "I think I shall be
      able to carry through my little 'real estate' scheme without much trouble, and I
      think it is a good one, at least I must try, for I am 'in' and I suppose I shall
      not be a true Whitman if I dont get disheartened, however I do not feel at all
      so just now. On the '<em>contrary quite the revarse</em> [<em>sic</em>].'"<a href="#r7">[back]
