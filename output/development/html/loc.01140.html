      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>With your letter came one from O'Connor bursting with wrath; I think I will enclose
      it to you. No doubt he will be a host there in W. &amp; will reach that
      miserable 
      Dist. Attny.
      
       yet. Tis a pity Osgood has not got some pluck &amp; so make a fight. No
      doubt we could beat them to tatters, &amp; make a big strike for the book Write
      &amp; ask him if he will
      
      
      fight if he is well backed up. It is the last thing I ever
      dreamed of. If this is the wish of Boston then I pray for her purification by a fire
      ten times bigger than the
      fire of a few years ago.
   </p>
   
   <p>I enclose my ck. for the amt. you ask for, $100.</p>
   
   <p>What a blank there in New England! To me Emerson filled nearly the whole horizon in
      that direction. But I suppose it is better so, tho' the very sunlight seems
      darkened. I should have gone to his funeral had I not had so much to do before
      sailing for England.
      
      
      I wrote a page on him for the Critic, yesterday, tho' I may be
      too late.
   </p>
   
   <p>If our passage was not paid to England, I should not go. I am ashamed to go off at
      such a time. I have had no heart for the trip from the first, &amp; now the death of
      Emerson (how those few words penetrate me!) &amp; your troubles, make me want to
      stay at home more than ever.
   </p>
   
   <p>If you have Mrs Gilchrist's address send it me; also that of Mr. Carpenter.</p>
   
   <p>I have written an essay on Carlyle which I think goes to the heart of him more than
       anything I
      have seen. I spoke to your <u>North American Review</u> man about it on
      Friday, but he did not bite; said it was not in his line, &amp;c. I shall probably
      offer it in London.
   </p>
   
   <p>If you do not hear from me again anything addressed to me care Henderson Brothers
      Glasgow, 49 &amp; 51 Union Street will be forwarded to me. We land at Glasgow &amp;
      shall stay there a few days.
   </p>
