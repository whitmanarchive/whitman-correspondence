   <p>Friday has come &amp; gone<sup><a href="#n1049" id="r2">2</a></sup>—&amp; no report as the dinner with the author
      of the, I fear, (abortive?) "Bride of Gettysburg"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wrote him that unless I wrote <u>au contraire</u> we 
      wd
      
       be there on Gods Holy Day. "Watchman tell us of the night"—war
      worn Veteran!—who like a true soldier wear your "wounds <u>&amp; Honors</u> a' front", speak to me!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Badinage aside, you cheered me, lustily, over that milk punch. Thy talk was like a
      crisp Healthful winters day—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="ucb.00061_n1">1. Whitman crossed out this
      letter and wrote a series of manuscript notes on the back of it.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1049">2. James Matlock Scovel began to
      practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War he was in the New Jersey
      legislature, and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned actively for Horace
      Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S. Treasury during Chester
      Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home
      for Sunday breakfast, as he did on December 2 and 9, 1877 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a description of
      these breakfasts, see <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed.
      William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel,
      see George R. Prowell's <em>The History of Camden County, New
         Jersey</em> (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886).<a href="#r2">[back]
