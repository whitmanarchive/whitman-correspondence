      <br></br><br></br>My dear Rudolf Schmidt,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#rlc.00007_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of 17th August<sup><a href="#rlc.00007_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> has just reached me—also the
      <em>Dagbladet</em>, (four no's.) The feuilleton about me I have just had read in English by a Dane, Mr.
      Bendz.<sup><a href="#rlc.00007_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I am deeply touched at being more and more brought
      right among warm human hearts in Denmark, Norway, &amp;c—&amp; so friendly entertained
      there. It comforts &amp; nourishes me more than you know. The former letters, &amp; the
      papers you have sent, have all come safely to hand—&amp; I thank you. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just returned from a visit of some days to Philadelphia. It is a great <em>materialistic city</em> full of the <em>middling classes</em>,
      (mechanics, laborers, operatives in factories (both sexes), traders, &amp;c)—in <em>extraordinary physical comfort</em>—700,000 people, &amp;
      five–sixths of them well–off, in plenty of the best food &amp; clothing, &amp;
      ample &amp; respectable houses—there are almost <em>no</em> very
      miserable &amp; vagabond classes or quarters in the city, vast &amp; teeming as it is. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am now back here at work for the fall &amp; winter—My address is permanently
      here—I get all your letters &amp; papers safely. Clausen<sup><a href="#rlc.00007_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      has not yet arrived. I have lately rec'd a paper from Pesth, Hungary, with a feuilleton about my poems.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="rlc.00007_n1">1. Schmidt, editor of <em>For
         Idé og Virkelighed</em>, wrote to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871: "I
      intend to write an article about yourself and your writings in the above named
      periodical which is very much read in all the Scandinavian countries. . . . I
      therefore take the liberty to ask you, if you should not be willing to afford
      some new communications of yourself and your poetry to this purpose" (Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00007_n2">2. Since Schmidt's letter is not extant, it
      is not possible to clarify the next few lines. The editor of the article in <em>Orbis Litterarum</em> did not find a reference to Walt Whitman
      in the <em>Dagbladet</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00007_n3">3. Waldemar E. Bendz was listed as a
      clerk.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00007_n4">4. 
      Carl F. Clausen, termed in Schmidt's letter "my old friend and countryman,"
      corresponded with Schmidt after he left Denmark in 1860; see <em>Orbis Litterarum</em>, 7 (1949), 34–39. The
      Directory in 1870 listed him as a draughtsman and in 1872 as a patent agent.
      He died of consumption in the middle 1870s; see Thomas Biggs Harned
      Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #108.<br><br>
      According to Whitman's  letter to
      Schmidt, Clausen had gone to Denmark in June 1872.
