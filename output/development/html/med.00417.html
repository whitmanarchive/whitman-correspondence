   <p>Mother, I am decidedly improving—feel more like myself the last three days—I walk
      very clumsily yet, &amp; do not try to get around by walking—but I think I am stronger
      now, 
      &amp; my prospects are better than any time yet. The doctor has applied electricity again
      to-day, 
      making the third application—So upon the whole I think I am doing real well—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have rec'd a letter from Priscilla Townsend<sup><a href="#med.00417_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—She speaks of you, says that Aunt Sally 
      always wants to hear from you—She speaks of Sarah Avery's<sup><a href="#med.00417_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> calling there, &amp; of Mrs. Tripp,<sup><a href="#med.00417_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; all—nothing very new—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am writing this over at the office—It is pleasant here, but cloudy &amp; coolish—Mother,
      I suppose you got my letter Saturday last—How is Sister Lou getting along—when you
      write tell me about her<sup><a href="#med.00417_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—George I suppose is full of business—Well I believe it is better for a man to have
      plenty to do, if he is well &amp; active—Well, mamma dear, I have written you quite a
      rambling letter—Tell me when you want envelopes 
      &amp; I will send them—write whenever you can—I think I shall be able to soon give a good
      account of my improvement.

   <p id="med.00417_n2">2. Priscilla Townsend was a
      cousin of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and apparently the granddaughter of Sarah
      Mead. Her husband James H. was a clerk in the New York "Hall of Records." The
      letter referred to is apparently not extant. In February 1873, Priscilla wrote
      to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman about Walt Whitman's illness (Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00417_n3">3.  Sarah Avery was another
      one of Walt Whitman's cousins. On ,
      she suggested with trepidation and apologies—she was so overawed by Walt
      Whitman's "knowledge and intellect"—that he should find a good wife for
      his old age. Her husband John, a New York merchant, wrote to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman twice in 1872 about interest due her from the estate of Elizabeth Maybee
      (Library of Congress).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00417_n4">4. Maggy Tripp was Priscilla
      Townsend's sister, so Louisa Van Velsor Whitman informed her son on April 3(?),
      1873 (The Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book,
      Manuscript, and Special Collections Library).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00417_n5">5. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      was not unduly concerned about her health; on , she wrote: "god forgive me if i judge wrongfully but i 
      dont
      
       think there is much the matter." She was correct: Louisa was not
      pregnant. On , she bitterly bewailed
      Louisa's economy, and continued to look forward to keeping house in Washington:
      "walt if you think you cant get a house for us to live in 
      dont
      
       worry about me. i shall live my allotted time. if you ever do get one
      i think one about the size of what i wrote about would do and 
      wouldent
      
       cost very much."<a href="#r5">[back]
