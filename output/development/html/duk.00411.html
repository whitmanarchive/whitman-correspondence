   <p>Han<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r1">1</a></sup> has rec'd your last, with letter from Mary (sister)<sup><a href="#n0386" id="r2">2</a></sup>, which
      interested her very much. But Han is much concerned about yourself—your
      confinement disabilities—she is extremely nervous, being weak from her prostrating
      sickness. Is striving hard however to do for herself—about the
      kitchen—has her own bedroom—large—airy, just as she needs or
      desired. We put up another stove last Saturday (heater) which I traded for—a
      heater—which fortunately came just in this nick of time—for a great change in the
      weather—cold.
   </p>
   
   <p>In reply to your question I would state that the address of our

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0285">1. Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908),
      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0386">2. Mary Van Nostrand Whitman (1821–1899) was the
      daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She
      married Ansel Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they lived in Greenport,
      Long Island. Mary and Ansel had five children: George, Minnie, Fanny, Louisa,
      and Ansel, Jr. See Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His
         Family</em> (Durham: North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949), 208, 207.

      this person.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">4. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02861_n2">5.  Alfred, Lord Tennyson
      (1809–1892), among the best-known British poets of the latter half of the
      nineteenth century, wrote such poems as "Morte d'Arthur," "Ulysses," "The Charge
      of the Light Brigade," and <em>In Memoriam A.H.H.</em>. In 1850,
      the same year <em>In Memoriam</em> was published, Tennyson was
      chosen as the new poet laureate of England, succeeding William Wordsworth. The
      intense male friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which
      Tennyson wrote after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly
      influenced Walt Whitman's poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman
      on July 12, 1871. Although Tennyson
      extended an invitation for Whitman to visit England in a July 12, 1871, letter, Whitman never acted on the
      offer.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00411_n3">6. Heyde is indicating here
      that he had been reading portions of <em>November Boughs</em>; one
      of the pieces in that book is "A Word about Tennyson," in which Whitman quotes a
      number of passages from Tennyson's poetry and writes: "Tennyson shows more than
      any poet I know (perhaps has been a warning to me) how much there is in finest
      verbalism. There is such latent charm in mere words, cunning collocutions, and
      in the voice ringing them, which he has caught and brought out, beyond all
      others."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00411_n2">7. "Enoch Arden" (1864) is a
      narrative poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson about a man who goes to sea to support
      his wife and children, is shipwrecked on an island for ten years, then returns
      home to find his wife married to one of his childhoood friends.<a href="#r7">[back]
