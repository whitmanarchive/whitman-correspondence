   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00174_n10">1. This letter dates to
      February 23, 1870. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter February 23 but
      did not provide a year. Edwin Haviland Miller did not cite the letter in his
      calendar of letters (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). The letter dates
      to the year 1870 based on Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's presence in
      Brooklyn, her intent to travel to Washington, D.C., and Joseph Phineas Davis's
      plan to visit Lowell, Massachusetts (see Mattie's  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n3">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00575_n9">3. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
      adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
      he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
      St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Jeff
      Whitman. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta "Hattie"
      (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" (b. 1863). In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to join Jeff after he had assumed the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in 1867. For more on Mattie, see
      the introduction to Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">4. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00174_n5">5. During Mattie Whitman's
      February 1870 visit to Brooklyn, Joseph Phineas Davis decided to depart St.
      Louis and take a position at Lowell, Massachusetts (see Mattie's February 27,
      1870 letter to Walt in Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1977], 68). Davis's decision to take the position at Lowell caused Jeff
      Whitman to depart Brooklyn earlier than he had planned.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00174_n18">6. No "s" in "particulars" is
      visible on the image nor can its presence be confirmed based on the manuscript.
      The letter is pasted into a manuscript book, and the final letters on the edge
      closest to the binding in the page image are often obscured. Most of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman manuscript letters in the bound volume entitled <em>Walt Whitman: A Series of Thirteen Letters from His Mother to Her Son</em>,
      held at the Harry Ransom Center, have obscured text on at least one page. Text
      from this page was recorded based on an examination of the physical volume,
      which allowed more text to be recovered.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">7. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00174_n7">8. Walt Whitman roomed at Mrs.
      Benedict's house in Washington, D.C. In his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, he stated "I moved to-day
      back again to the same house Mrs. Grayson used to live in—it is now
      occupied by a Mr. &amp; Mrs. Benedict."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00174_n6">9. George F. Mason was a
      prominent Pennsylvania businessman and state senator, with whom Mattie Whitman
      stayed after selling her furniture in preparation for the trip to St. Louis in
      1867. Mason's daughter Irene was a close friend of Mattie (see Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman;
      Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha
         Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 37, 42).
      Gordon's son Julius "Jules" Mason (1835–1882) was a lieutenant colonel in
      the Fifth Cavalry. Jeff Whitman wrote that Mason "used to be in my party on the
      Water Works" (see his  letter to
      Walt). Jules Mason helped to get supplies to George Washington Whitman when he
      was held prisoner (see Jeff's 
      letter to Walt).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n5">10. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
      later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
      Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
      pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
      correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
      poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r10">[back]
