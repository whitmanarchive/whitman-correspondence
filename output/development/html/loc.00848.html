      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I trust you will pardon the liberty I have taken to trouble you with a matter of no
      personal interest to yourself.  My excuse for writing to you is, that it is a matter
      of the utmost importance to a client of mine.
   </p>
   
   <p>The Deed executed to Lazarus Wineburgh<sup><a href="#loc.00848_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup> in 1854 does not express the consideration money.  Wineburgh has recently effected
      a sale of the property conveyed by that Deed; but objection is made to the title on
      the grounds of such omission.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have drawn another Deed which I send together with the old one. Will you be so kind
      as to execute this new Deed before a Commissioner of Deeds for the State of New York; and Mr Wineburgh will be under the greatest obligation to you.
      
      As the execution of this deed and its speedy return is of great importance to Wineburgh,
      I respectfully request that you execute it at your earliest convenience.
   </p>
   
   <p>If you will inform us what your charges and disbursements are we will remit by return
      of mail, or will arrange the matter on your return to this city.
   </p>

      Yours most respectfully,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00848_n100">1. Frederick Baker, attorney
      at law, wrote on behalf of Lazarus Wineburgh, who bought a house on Cumberland
      Street from Whitman in 1854. See Whitman's response to Frederick Baker from . See also Whitman's letter to Albert
      Johnston, March 27, 1882, mentioning the sale to Wineburgh. See also Cleveland
      Rogers, "The Good Gray House Builder," <em>Walt Whitman
         Review</em> 5.4 (December 1959), 63â€“69. "He sold the two-story house
      [on Cumberland Street] to Lazarus Wineburgh on 15 March 1854" (68). According to
      Joann Krieg's <em>Chronology</em>, Whitman built a house on
      Cumberland Street in Brooklyn in May 1852, and he sold the house in March of
      1853. See Joann P. Krieg, <em>A Whitman Chronology</em> (Iowa
