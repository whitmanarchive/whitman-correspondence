      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd the letter you wrote last Wednesday<sup><a href="#nyp.00260_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—It has been rainy weather again here, &amp; plenty of mud—Sunday afternoon I was at the
      Hospital—that young man that was so low with bleeding at the lungs, Kephart,<sup><a href="#nyp.00260_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> was easier—he was very bad just after I wrote last week—but Sunday it seemed as though
      he might recover yet if he had good luck—he has written to his folks at Harper's Ferry,
      West Va.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I went up to the Capitol Sunday night—Congress was in full blast in both houses—they
      paid no more attention to its being Sunday, than if it was any other day—which I thought
      a very good sign—the Radicals have passed their principal measures over the President's
      vetos—as you will see in the papers. There is much talk about impeachment—but I think
      it is very doubtful if there is any impeachment<sup><a href="#nyp.00260_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>O mother, I must not forget to tell the <em>great news among Clerks</em> (far more important than Reconstruction, 
      or impeaching Andy)—that is, we are going to have 20 percent addition to our pay,
      for the present year—that is, I shall get quite a handsome little sum, back pay, &amp;
      about $25 additional, a month, till 1st of July next—if I stay here. We havnt got
      the money yet, but I suppose it is sure—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I like my boarding house very well, take it altogether—we have a tip-top table—&amp; the
      folks are kind &amp; accommodating.<sup><a href="#nyp.00260_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The Old Congress went out yesterday, &amp; the new one (the 40th) organized right away—the
      Republicans have a strong majority<sup><a href="#nyp.00260_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is dark &amp; rainy this forenoon here—snow &amp; drizzle—</p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, you must not imagine any thing about me—I am having good times enough—"eat
      well &amp; sleep well," as Dr. Ruggles<sup><a href="#nyp.00260_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> says—&amp; have a pocket full of money—which you can call upon when you want any—as I
      look out of the window while I write, I see we are having a little snow for a change—So
      good bye for this time, mother dear—Love to George &amp; Jeff &amp; all,<sup><a href="#nyp.00260_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00260_n1">1. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's letter of  was filled
      with complaints about her health ("i feel my age more this winter then i ever
      did before"), about Jeff's children, and about George's business
      difficulties.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00260_n2">2. 
      Walt Whitman first wrote of Andrew J. Kephart in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Kephart
      was a soldier from Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, admitted from the 44th
      Regiment Infantry for bleeding at the lungs. <br><br>
      Walt Whitman also wrote about Kephart's recovery in his  and  letters to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, and by Whitman's letter
      of , Kephart had "quite
      recovered."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00260_n3">3. Congress did vote twice to
      impeach President Andrew Johnson. On December 5, 1867, an impeachment vote
      failed 57–108; all three votes of the more famous May 1868 impeachment
      motion failed 35–19, one vote shy of the two-thirds majority needed for an
      impeachment conviction.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00260_n4">4. Walt Whitman had written in
      his  letter to his mother that he
      had moved back into Juliet Grayson's boarding house, though his original room
      was now occupied by Newton Benedict.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00260_n5">5. The new Congress,
      according to the New York <em>Herald</em>, had 128 Republicans and
      35 Democrats in the House and 40 Republicans and 12 Democrats in the
      Senate.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00260_n6">6. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Whitman's brother Jeff and sister-in-law Mattie. Late in
      life, Ruggles lost interest in his practice and devoted himself to painting
      cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00260_n7">7. According to Walt Whitman's
       letter to his mother, this
      letter also included money and envelopes. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman confirmed
      receipt of the money and the envelopes in her  letter to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r7">[back]
