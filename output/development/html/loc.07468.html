   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4162">2. James Francis Walsh was a young
      Camden physician who attended Whitman, visiting him nearly every day, during the
      poet's illness of 1888–89. Walsh was the brother of William S. Walsh, an
      American author and editor of <em>Lippincott's Monthly
         Magazine</em>. Whitman had a favorable opinion of Walsh because he visited
      often, watched his patient carefully, but did not give medicine. See Whitman's
      letter to Bucke of . Bucke had
      arranged to have Walsh accompany Dr. Osler to see Whitman, since Bucke believed
      it would be useful to have a younger doctor examine the poet. See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.35.html">Wednesday, December 5, 1888</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]
