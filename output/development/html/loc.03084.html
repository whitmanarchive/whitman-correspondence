   <p>Spent last Sunday reading O'Connor's<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup> stories &amp; roared in the
      Athenaeum over his ballad of Sir Ball [
      <span class="unclear">with?</span>]
       the Sword of Manley"<sup><a href="#nyp.00268_n7" id="r2">2</a></sup> I
      was set aglow by the hearty, bluff humor, the luxuriance &amp; 
      abullience
      
       of one of the characters. All of O'C's stories contain himself as one
      character. He always makes me <u>better</u>. <u>Pity he hadn't written more</u>. Yr card rec'd to-night this is the one
      peaceful hour before bed &amp; sleep. Wife sewing[,] cats gorged with meat stretched
      before grate, clock ticking. Heard Booth<sup><a href="#loc.05827_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> recently in
      [illegible]—<u>as such</u>.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
