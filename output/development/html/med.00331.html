      <em>My dear Walt</em>: I spent much time yesterday reading your poems, and am more charmed with them than
      ever. I think you would have done well to follow Mr. Emerson's advice, but you may
      have done better as it is. At any rate, the book is bound to sell, if money enough
      is spent circulating the Reprints and advertising it generally. It is a fundamental
      principle in political economy that everything succeeds if money enough is spent on
      it. If I could spend five hundred dollars in one week on the Saturday Press I would
      make five thousand dollars by the operation. Ditto you with the L. of G.
   </p>  
   
   <p>You should send copies at once to Vanity Fair, Momus, The Albion, The Day Book, The
      Journal of Commerce, Crayon—also to Mrs. Juliette H. Beach, Albion, N.Y.,<sup><a href="#med.00331_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> who will do you great justice in the S.P. (for we shall have a <em>series</em> of articles)—to Charles D. Gardette Esq,<sup><a href="#med.00331_n101" id="r2">2</a></sup> No 910 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, to Evening Journal, Philadelphia, and also some
      dozen copies to me to be distributed at discretion. Do not hereafter ask the editors
      to notice at any particular time or at all: for the effect is bad.
   </p>
   
   <p>I want to do great things for you with the book, and as soon as I get over my immediate
      troubles will do so. But just now I am in a state of despair even in respect to getting
      out another issue of the S.P. and all for want of a paltry two or three hundred dollars
      which would take the thing to a paying point, and make it worth ten thousand dollars
      as a transferable piece of property.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Henry Clapp, Jr. (1814–1875)
      was a journalist, editor and reformer. Whitman and Clapp most likely met in
      Charles Pfaff's beer cellar, located in lower Manhattan. Clapp, who founded the
      literary weekly the <em>Saturday Press</em> in 1858, was
      instrumental in promoting Whitman's poetry and celebrity: over twenty items on
      Whitman appeared in the <em>Press</em> before the periodical
      folded (for the first time) in 1860. Of Clapp Whitman told Horace Traubel, "You
      will have to know something about Henry Clapp if you want to know all about me."
      For more about Whitman's thoughts on Clapp, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, (1906–1996), 9 vols.,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00331_n3">1. The review of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> that appeared in the <em>New–York Saturday Press</em> on June 2, 1860, was signed "Juliette H.
      Beach," but it had really been written by her husband, Calvin Beach. Expecting a
      favorable response, the editor of the <em>Saturday Press</em>,
      Henry Clapp, Jr., had forwarded a copy of Whitman's book to Juliette Beach for
      review. Her husband, however, angered that Clapp had sent the book to his wife,
      appropriated it and wrote a scathing review, which was published in his wife's
      name. In a letter to Clapp dated June 7, 1860, Juliette Beach explained the
      nature of the mistake and expressed her regret at not having had the opportunity
      to publish her own favorable opinion of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.
      In an attempt to undo some of the damage, Clapp printed a notice titled
      "Correction" in the subsequent issue of his newspaper, alongside three positive
      commentaries on <em>Leaves of Grass</em> by women. (For Calvin
      Beach's review of the 1860 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1860/anc.00039.html">Leaves of Grass</a>.") Ellen O'Connor contributed her bit to the theory
      that Beach and Walt Whitman had a love affair when she asserted that "Out of the
      Rolling Ocean, the Crowd," published in <em>Drum-Taps</em>, was
      composed for "a certain lady" who had angered her husband because of her
      correspondence with the poet (Emory Holloway, ed., <em>The
         Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman</em>, [Garden City, New York:
      Doubleday, Page and Company, 1921], 1:lviii). "Mrs. Beach's notes" may be the
      letters to Walt Whitman, which later Burroughs vainly asked Mrs. Beach to print;
      see Clara Barrus, <em>The Life and Letters of John Burroughs</em>
      (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1925), 1:120. If these were love letters,
      Walt Whitman hardly treated Mrs. Beach's heart-stirrings discreetly. See also
      Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of
         Walt Whitman</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1955; rev. ed., New York University
      Press, 1967), 340–342.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="med.00331_n101">2. Charles Desmarais Gardette
      was a former reporter for the <em>New York Evening Post</em> who
      now wrote for the <em>Philadelphia Evening Journal</em> and also
      contributed frequently to the <em>Saturday Press</em>—and whenever
      in New York joined Clapp, Whitman, and the others at the Bohemian table at
      Pfaff's. An accomplished parodist, Gardette achieved his greatest fame when
      challenged by his friends to create a perfect imitation of Poe. His homage,
      published in the November 19, 1859, issue of the <em>Saturday
         Press</em>, was so convincing that it continued to surface in volumes of
      Poe's collected works into the twentieth century, even after Gardette published
      detailed accounts of its composition. Under the pen-name "Saerasmid" (an anagram
      of "Desmarais"), Gardette published several parodies of Whitman in the <em>Saturday Press</em> in 1860: "Yourn and Mine, and Any-Day (A
      Yawp, After Walt Whitman)" (January 21), "Poemet—(After Walt Whitman)" (February
      11), and "Saerasmid to Walt Whitman, A Greeting" (June 16). See George Pierce
      Clark, "'Saerasmid,' An Early Promoter of Walt Whitman," <em>American Literature</em> (1955): 259–62.<a href="#r2">[back]
