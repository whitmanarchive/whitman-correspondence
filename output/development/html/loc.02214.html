   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02214_n1">1. In a form letter on , Gilder and his sister Jeanette of
      <em>The Critic</em> asked for Walt Whitman's "answer to the
      question raised by Mr. Edmund Gosse in his paper in the October Forum, entitled
      'Has America Produced a Poet?'—the question, namely, whether any American
      poet, not now living, deserves a place among the thirteen 'English inheritors of
      unassailed renown.'" Walt Whitman sent his reply on October 20, 1888, which J.
      B. Gilder acknowledges here (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.18.html">Sunday, November 18, 1888</a>). Whitman's response was published in the
      November 24, 1888, <em>Critic</em>, along with responses by many
      other writers (including John Greenleaf Whittier, John Burroughs, Francis
      Parkman, and Julia Ward Howe). See also Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.100.html">Monday, October 22, 1888</a>.<a href="#r1">[back]
