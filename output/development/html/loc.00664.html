   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00664_n1">1. Richard Maurice Bucke dates
      this letter 1892, confirmed by Hannah's references to Walt's health. On February
      8, Whitman had written that he was "probably growing weaker"; on February 24,
      "Still lingering along pretty low," but he nevertheless enclosed five dollars
      for his sister. His last letter to Hannah, and the last letter he wrote, was
      dated March 17.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00664_n2">2.  After Dr. Thayer died in
      1882, Dr. Leroy Monroe Bingham (1845-1911) became Hannah's doctor. He studied
      medicine at the University of Vermont and at Bellevue College in New York, and
      moved to Burlington in 1874. According to the <em>Vermont Medical
         Monthly</em>, "From about 1878, for a period of 20 years, he was one of the
      most active and the best known surgeons in Vermont" (Volume 17, Issue 12, Dec.
      15, 1911), 306.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00664_n3">3. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman
      (1842-1892) married George Whitman on March 14, 1871. They moved to Camden in
      1872, and Walt Whitman lived with them from 1873-1884. See Karen Wolfe,
      "Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842-1892)," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland, 1998), 781.<a href="#r3">[back]
