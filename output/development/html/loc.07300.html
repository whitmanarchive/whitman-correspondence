   <p>It is a perfect Spring day. Bright and not too warm. I have been out about the garden
      and grounds nearly all day a good part of the day your old friend Norman
      Mackenzie<sup><a href="#n3020b" id="r1">1</a></sup> was with me (he is spending the Sunday
      here—is on his way home from Toronto—been there for his "2<u>d</u> intermediate" law examination—which he
      passed—he has now studied law 3 years and has 2 more to study). Norman and I
      had a good deal to talk about you Norman says he remembers you and all you did and
      said (when he knew you in '80—he being then 12 years old) as well as if it was
      only a week ago.<sup><a href="#loc.07300_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> He<sup><a href="#loc.07300_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> remarked that there must be something extraordinary about you to cause
      you to be remembered in this persistent manner. He is a very fine boy and greatly
      liked.
   </p> 
   
   <p>Your card of 9<u>th</u> came to hand yesterday<sup><a href="#loc.07300_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I hope you
      will send me word (as you get it) about O'C.,<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r5">5</a></sup> poor fellow I
      fear he is very sick.<sup><a href="#loc.07300_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> I hope he is not suffering much.
      We must make up our minds to lose him, I do trust however he will not have much pain
      or suffering to bear. I hope you have been out in your chair.<sup><a href="#loc.03012_n1" id="r7">7</a></sup> If you <u>could</u> only get out once or twice a day for a short time
      surely it would be a wonderful relief to you from the dreadful monotony of your life
      the last eleven months. Be sure and let me know how you get on with the chair.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3020b">1. Norman McKenzie was a high
      school student in Sarnia. Whitman undoubtedly met the boy when he visited a
      public school in Sarnia (<em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed.
      William Sloane Kennedy [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904], 8–9); probably McKenzie 
      accompanied the poet on "A Moonlight Excursion up
      Lake Huron" (7–8).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07300_n1">2. Bucke has made an "X" with
      an insertion mark in red at this point in the letter. It refers to an addition
      written at the bottom of the page. The addition: "He remarked that there must be
      something extraordinary about you to cause you to be remembered in this
      persistent manner" has been transcribed here, in the body of the letter, where
      Bucke intended to include it.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07300_n2">3. See McKenzie's letter
      to Whitman of . Whitman spells the
      young man's surname "McKenzie." Bucke spells it "MacKenzie."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07300_n4">4. Bucke is referring to
      Whitman's letter of .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">5. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.03012_n1">7. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy of .<a href="#r7">[back]
