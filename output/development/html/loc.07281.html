   <p>I have been for several days in great anxiety about you,<sup><a href="#loc.07281_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      dear Walt, and am yet though your letter of 13<u>th</u> relieves
      me a little for it shows me that (as you say) you <u>can</u>
      write, and I was really afraid you <u>could not</u><sup><a href="#loc.07281_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—The big book<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r4">4</a></sup> (4 copies) is on its way—I
      expect to get it this afternoon—if not certainly monday monring—am going
      to town myself in an hour to ask after the parcel, am very eager to have it. I am
      very glad Ed.W.<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r5">5</a></sup> is with you these bad times instead of Musgrove<sup><a href="#loc.07239_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup>—I feel sure
      Ed. will do Every thing in his power for you. I shall write a special letter as soon as
      I get the big book. I wish we could hear from O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r7">7</a></sup> I fear
      he is in a bad way.
   </p>
   
   <p>If the thing was <u>possible</u> I should go to Camden and <u>stay</u> with you—but it is <u>not</u> possible so no use talking of it. Perhaps I could do no good if I was
      there certainly you have a better doctor by far than I am—I mean Osler.<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r8">8</a></sup> But it
      seems to me they do not take the interest they ought.

   <p>We are all well here, cold weather but no sleighing yet.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07281_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: London | PM | DE 15 | 88 | Canada; Camden N. J. | Dec | 17 | 6 AM |
      1888 | Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07281_n2">2. Bucke's worries
      about Whitman's declining health led him to send a request to Horace Traubel
      on December 14, 1888, directing Traubel to contact him via telegram
      if Whitman's death seemed imminent.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07281_n3">3. Bucke is referring to
      Whitman's letter of , in which
      Whitman reports having had "another bad spell" and suffering from "extreme
      debility."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">4. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">5. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07239_n2">6.  W. A. Musgrove replaced Dr.
      Nathan M. Baker as Whitman's caregiver on July 15, 1888. Musgrove was far less
      satisfactory than Baker. Traubel noted that "Musgrove is a cloudy man. I asked
      how M. got on. W. evaded the question by some general remark. . . . He
      [Musgrove] is only a nurse—not a doctor" (Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.2.html">Monday, July 16, 1888</a>). Yet, Whitman later described Musgrove as
      "kind active &amp; considerate all through" (See the letter from Whitman to
      Bucke of .<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">7. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4302">8. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on
      Osler, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitman-dev.unl.edu/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_202.html">Osler, Dr. William (1849–1919)</a>," <em>Walt
