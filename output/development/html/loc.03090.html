   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00630_n9">1. Priscilla or Lillie (Mead)
      Townsend was probably Walt Whitman's second cousin, the daughter of Sally
      (Williams) Mead, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's aunt. Priscilla's husband James H.
      Townsend was a clerk in the New York "Hall of Records." Sally (Williams) Mead
      and Phoebe (Williams) Pintard were sisters of Walt Whitman's maternal
      grandmother Naomi or Amy Williams (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:210, n. 52; Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 596).
      Louisa was responding to a question from Walt, "What is Aunt Sally's
      name—is it <em>Sarah Pintard</em>"? (see his  letter to Louisa). These
      letters from relatives were probably prompted by the report of Walt's stroke in
      the <em>New York Herald</em> (see Louisa's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r1">[back]
