      <br></br><br></br>Dear Charles Stoddard,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.01686_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received some days since your affectionate letter, &amp; presently came your beautiful
      &amp; soothing South Sea Idyll which I read at once.<sup><a href="#loc.01686_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now, as I write, I sit by a large open window, looking south &amp; west down the Potomac
      &amp; across to the Virginia heights. It is a bright, warm spring-like afternoon. I have
      just re-read the sweet story all over, &amp; find it indeed soothing &amp; nourishing after
      its kind, like the atmosphere. As to you, I do not of course object to your emotional
      &amp;
      adhesive nature, &amp; the outlet thereof, but warmly approve them—but do you know
      (perhaps you do,) how the hard, pungent, gritty, worldly experiences &amp; qualities in
      American practical life, also serve? how they prevent extravagant sentimentalism?
      &amp; how
      they are not without their own great value &amp; even joy?<sup><a href="#loc.01686_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It arises in my mind, as I write, to say something of that kind to you—</p>
   
   
   <p>I am not a little comforted when I learn that the young men dwell in thought upon
      me &amp;
      my utterances—as you do—&amp; I frankly send you my love—&amp; I hope we
      shall one day meet—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01686_n1">1. Stoddard (1843–1909) published <em>Poems</em>, edited by Bret Harte, in 1867. His most famous
      book, <em>South-Sea Idyls</em> (1873), is mentioned in this
      letter. Stoddard was a journalist, a lecturer at the Catholic University of
      America from 1889 to 1902, and for a brief period Mark Twain's secretary.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01686_n2">2. Stoddard's letter of , began dramatically: "In the name of
      CALAMUS listen to me!" He was sending "a 
      proze
      
      
      <em>idyl</em> wherein I confess how dear [barbarism] is to me." "A
      South-Sea Idyl," which appeared in the <em>Overland Monthly</em>,
      3 (September 1869), 257–264, related, with thinly veiled homosexual
      overtones, Stoddard's relations with a sixteen-year-old native boy
      Kána-ána. It was reprinted as Part One of "Chumming with a Savage" in
      <em>South-Sea Idyls</em> (1873).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01686_n3">3. Walt Whitman was obviously trying to check
      the seething emotion of this young man who was about to sail for Tahiti.
      Stoddard had written, in his letter of , "I know there is but one hope for me. I must get in amongst
      people who are not afraid of instincts and who scorn 
      hypocracy
      
      . I am numbed with the frigid manners of the Christians; barbarism has
      given me the fullest joy of my life and I long to return to it and be
      satisfied."<a href="#r3">[back]
