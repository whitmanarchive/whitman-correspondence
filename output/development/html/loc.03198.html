   <p>
      I see you 
      sometimes
      (exceptionally) print
      poems in the
      <u>Nineteenth</u>. Could you 
      use the herewith? It is intended to make up in two pages.
      I have had it put in type
      for my own convenience, and
      greater exactness.
      The price is $150.
