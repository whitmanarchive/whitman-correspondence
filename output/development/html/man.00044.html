      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Friend,
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Perhaps you thought I had forgotten you, but I have not much time to myself on
      school-days.<sup><a href="#n3020" id="r1">1</a></sup> Do you remember the nice sail we had that night on the lake and river,
      I will never forget it, you, and I had such a pleasant time up in the bow of the
      boat when I sat on your lap and asked you questions about the which you wrote about
      in your book named Two Rivulets. Our mid-summer-holidays begin on the thirteenth of July and
      I think that I am going down to London then if all is well and Mr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> has asked me to stay at his place first so that
      I will be able to see you again for I do miss you so much since you have gone. I
      suppose you will have plenty of fun on Dominion Day, I expect to as we always did
      before. I am going to by some fire-cracker and go up to the lake to shoot them
      off as it is against the law to fire them off within the limits of the town. When
      you write to me please tell me how you enjoyed Dominion Day for I would like to
      know. Please give my love to all and as I have told you all I know I will close
      here.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3020">1. Norman McKenzie was a high
      school student in Sarnia. Whitman undoubtedly met the boy when he visited a
      public school in Sarnia (<em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>,
      8–9); probably McKenzie accompanied the poet on "A Moonlight Excursion up
      Lake Huron" (7–8). Whitman replied (lost) to the boy's letter on July 4
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839—1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
