   <p>The enclosed $5 is from Mr James P. Kirkwood<sup><a href="#loc.00431_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> and is the money spoken of in my letter from Copake.<sup><a href="#loc.00431_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> The other $1 is from John D. Martin.<sup><a href="#loc.00431_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I mailed you some 3 or 4 Unions<sup><a href="#loc.00431_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> to-day directed to the care of major Hapgood<sup><a href="#loc.00431_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> as usual
   </p>
   
   <p>At home everything is going along abt as usual, all abt the same.</p>
   
   <p>A few days ago there came to the house for you the proof sheets of a small book which
      the author (no name given) wants you to read and give an opinion on &nbsp;the Circular
      you find within. The stuff itself is disgusting, the whole of it going to prove that
      the nigger is better than the white which the fool says over and over again<sup><a href="#loc.00431_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—do you want it sent on to you.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

      the paymaster of the army volunteers, employed Walt Whitman as a copyist from
      December 1862 to January 1865. Charles W. Eldridge, co–publisher of the
      1860 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and later a clerk in Hapgood's
      office, helped the poet gain this employment. Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:11 and 162, n. 83).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.00431_n6">6. No record indicates the
      poet read this book, but he probably would not have been sympathetic with its
      thesis. Whitman also rejected arguments for white superiority; he marked an
      article on "The Slavonians and Eastern Europe," <em>North British
         Review</em>, American edition, 11 (August 1849), 283, which argued that
      there are "three varieties of human beings" and that "up to the present moment,
      the destinies of the species appear to have been carried forward almost
      exclusively by its Caucasian variety." The poet responded in the margin: "? yes
      of late centuries, but how about those 5, or 10, or twenty thousand years ago?"
