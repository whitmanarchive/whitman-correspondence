   <p>With full heart, with eyes wet with tears of joy &amp; I know not what other deep
      emotion—pain of yearning pity blent with the sense of grandeur, dearest Friend
      have I read and reread the great sacred Poem just come to me. O august Columbus! whose sorrows
      sufferings struggles are more to be  envied than any triumph of conquering warrior—as I see him
      in your poem his figure merges into yours, brother of Columbus. Completer of his
      work, discoverer of the spiritual, the ideal America—you too have sailed over
      stormy seas to your goal—surrounded with mocking disbelievers—you too
      have paid the great price of health—our  Columbus.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
