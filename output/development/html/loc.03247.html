      <br></br><br></br>O Good Gray Poet,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>When I read the notes on your life made by Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      the tears came to my eyes, and I would have given much to have seen yourself, that
      I
      might have knelt before you, &amp; kissed the hands that had ministered so tenderly to
      wounded men.
   </p>
   
   <p>When I read your writings I get inspiration, I have the feeling of the boundlessness
      of the universe, of the greatness 
      
      of a man—perhaps, only perhaps, it may be my glory to help
      others to "justify" your work; it surely is my hearts desire.
   </p>
   
   <p>My excuse for writing you is the sending of a book; a first utterance, called "Voices
      &amp; Undertones"—it bears greeting and admiring love, though it may be a poor
      messenger to bear the treasure.
   </p>
   
   <p>Some day I hope to hear your voice. God give you peace and perpetual hope!</p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Your unknown friend
      <br></br>Wm. P. McKenzie
