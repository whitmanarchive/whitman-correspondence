      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Rudolf Schmidt:<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.01711_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your note of Jan. 5, acknowledging receipt of "papers," &amp; enclosing to me your
      photograph,<sup><a href="#loc.01711_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> is just received. I like your
      photograph &amp; thank you for it—&amp; I like indeed the good frank way of
      sending such pictures, where interested &amp; curious. I wish to know whether you
      have safely received the particular copy of the last edition of my poems, in One
      Vol., with some sheet photos. enclosed, which I sent you by Mr. Clausen.<sup><a href="#loc.01711_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> Mr. C. tells me that he put up the various matter I
      furnished in three parcels—if you have got the three it is all right.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I mailed you a letter of some length, Jan. 16. I shall send you, probably by next
      mail, my latest piece, in a western magazine for February.<sup><a href="#loc.01711_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Also a second
      copy of my pamphlet "Democratic Vistas"—If the first copy reached you, send
      the second to Mr. Bjornson<sup><a href="#loc.01711_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—if not, not. Yes, I am sure
      I should like your friend Bjornson much.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am going next week to New York to stay there till April 10—my address there
      will be <em>107 north Portland av. Brooklyn, New York, U. S.
         America</em>—about April 10, I shall return here again, &amp; my address
      will be<sup><a href="#loc.01711_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am writing this at my desk—as above, Treasury Building, middle of
      afternoon—From my great south window I can see a far-stretching &amp; noble
      view, many, many miles of open ground, the Potomac river, the hilly banks, the
      mountains of Virginia &amp;c. We are having a severe cold spell. Every thing is
      white with snow, but the sun has been clear &amp; dazzling all day—The hour of
      office-closing is nigh. And I too must close. I have much pleasure in writing to
      you, &amp; expecting yours.<sup><a href="#loc.01711_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>

   <p id="loc.01711_n2">2. Rudolf Schmidt, editor of
      <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em>, wrote to Walt Whitman on
      October 19, 1871: I intend to write an article about yourself and your writings
      in the above named periodical which is very much read in all the Scandinavian
      countries.…I therefore take the liberty to ask you, if you should not be
      willing to afford some new communications of yourself and your poetry to this
      purpose" (Library of Congress).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.01711_n3">3. The photograph, inscribed
      "To Walt Whitman | the poet of the american democracy," is in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.; Schmidt's  letter is in the Syracuse University Library.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01711_n4">4. Carl F. Clausen, termed
      in Schmidt's letter "my old friend and countryman," corresponded with Schmidt
      after he left Denmark in 1860; see <em>Orbis Litterarum</em>, 7
      (1949), 34–39. The Directory in 1870 listed him as a draughtsman and in
      1872 as a patent agent. He died of consumption in the middle 1870s.<a href="#r4">[back]

      Björnson (1832–1910), Norwegian poet, dramatist, and novelist, was
      co-editor of Schmidt's journal. In his  letter Schmidt observed: "Hans Christian Andersen would perhaps
      not make you very great joy, if you did know him personally. Björnson would
      be your man." Schmidt later altered his opinion of Björnson; see notes to
      Whitman's  letter to Schmidt.<a href="#r6">[back]
