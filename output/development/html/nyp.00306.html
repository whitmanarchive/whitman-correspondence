      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Forman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter &amp; the fine poem of "the Great Peace-Maker" have been 
      rec'd
      
       by me, &amp; read with pleasure.<sup><a href="#nyp.00306_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> With regard to re-printing my book
      in full in England<sup><a href="#nyp.00306_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I can only say that of course it would be gratifying to me—But I should like to
      be informed in advance of any thing pending that way, as I should like to make one
      or two suggestions before the book is begun. A preface or introduction mainly of
      statistical nature (about the book &amp; myself) including a brief syllabus of the
      plan &amp; idea of "Leaves of Grass" from its own point of view—would be
      judicious—but I don't think favorably of a literary criticism for
      preface—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have an Edition (the sixth)<sup><a href="#nyp.00306_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> just out—edition
      1872—in some respects probably the best—Sampson Low, and Trübner have copies of it.—It looks just now as though some form
      of international copyright might be legalized here—If so, this might be worth
      considering in reference to the reprint of my book in England.<sup><a href="#nyp.00306_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>If you can get a look at the Danish (Copenhagen) Monthly Magazine <em>"For Ide og Virkeliged,"</em> "For Idea &amp; Reality,"
      either of 
      Feb.
      
       or March, I am not certain which, I understand it has a criticism on my
      book, from a believer.<sup><a href="#nyp.00306_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> I am here on a
      visit, &amp; return to Washington in a few days.<sup><a href="#nyp.00306_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> I shall always be happy to hear
      from you. My address is Solicitor's Office, Treasury, Washington,
      D. C.—U.S.A.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Henry Buxton Forman (1842–1917) was most
      notably the biographer and editor of Percy Shelley and John Keats. On , Buxton sent a copy of R. H.
      Horne's <em>The Great Peace-Maker; A Sub-marine Dialogue</em>
      (London, 1872) to Whitman. This poetic account of the laying of the Atlantic
      cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death, Forman's reputation
      declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham Pollard and John Carter
      published <em>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth
         Century Pamphlets</em>, which exposed Forman as a forger of many first
      "private" editions of poetry.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00306_n1">1. On , H. Buxton Forman
      (1842–1917), later the biographer of Shelley and Keats, sent to Whitman a
      copy of R. H. Horne's <em>The Great Peace-Maker; A Sub-marine
         Dialogue</em> (London: Sampson Low, Marston, Low, &amp; Searle, 1872). This
      poetic account of the laying of the Atlantic cable has a foreword written by
      Forman.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00306_n2">2. Forman proposed an
      English edition of Whitman's writings "verbatim, without any retrenchments," a
      project of which the poet thoroughly approved (see Forman's letter to Whitman of
      ).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00306_n3">3. The 1872 edition is the
