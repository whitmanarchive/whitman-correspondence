      <br></br><br></br>Dear Charley,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If the next <em>Sunday Morning Chronicle</em><sup><a href="#loc.01593_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> contains a "personal" about me, would you do me the favor to get
      half a dozen copies, &amp; keep for me? I shall doubtless return about the
      26th—as my leave expires that day. (I wished to stay to vote, but have paired
      off with a vehement Seymourite, an old friend of mine.) I suppose Nelly received a
      letter I sent her yesterday, to your care.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am writing this in my room at Mr. &amp; Mrs. Davis's. I came here yesterday, after
      three most agreeable days with Dr. Channing &amp; Jeannie. As I write, we are
      expecting a call from William O'C. as he promised yesterday to come over &amp; see
      Mrs. D. and myself, &amp; spend an hour or two. This afternoon, after dinner, Mr.
      Davis whom I like, &amp; get along with first rate, is going to take me out to ride,
      down to the Point, as I wish to see more of the harbor &amp; bay. I am treated on
      all sides with the greatest hospitality &amp; courtesy—&amp; yet left just as
      free as I wish to be. It is beautiful fall weather to-day. I go back to New York
      &amp; Brooklyn on Thursday next.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am profoundly impressed with Providence, not only for its charming locality &amp;
      features, but for its proof &amp; expression of fine relations, as a city, to
      average human comfort, life, &amp; family &amp; individual independence &amp;
      thrift—<em>After all, New England for ever!</em>—(with
      perhaps just one or two little reservations)—With love to you,
      Charley—&amp; repeated again to dear Nelly. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours truly
      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>P.S.—Later—2 o'clock—William &amp; Dr. Channing have been over
      here—staid  to dinner—We had quite a gay time—indeed quite a
      little dinner party—William &amp; Doctor, Mr &amp; Mrs. Davis, Nora
      Perry,<sup><a href="#loc.01593_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> George Davis,<sup><a href="#loc.01593_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      Katy Hinds,<sup><a href="#loc.01593_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; illustrious self—We are
      just through—Doctor has gone home, not wishing to leave Jeannie too
      long—William still remaining—I go presently on the drive with Mr.
      D.—and also to deposite this letter in P. O.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01593_n1">1. 
      The following notice in the Washington <em>Sunday Morning
         Chronicle</em> was Walt Whitman's public version of his vacation: 
      
      
      <br><br><span class="indent">"After an absence of some weeks, Walt Whitman, the poet, is
         just returning, we hear, to his residence and employment in
         this city. Besides visiting his mother at Brooklyn, and
         recuperating down Long Island and at Providence and Newport,
         he has spent quite a while 'loafing at his ease' in New
         York, among the streets, docks, throngs on Broadway, and
         upon the waters adjacent to that great metropolis,
         abandoning himself to one of his favorite spells of studying
         and enjoying the life and scenes there, not for pleasure
         alone, but to give color to his characteristic poetry. Mr.
         Whitman, however, we may say in passing, it is understood
         among his friends, has been for some time and is now
         principally engaged on a poem, or a series of poems,
         intended to touch the religious and spiritual wants of
         humanity, with which he proposes to round off and finish his
         celebrated 'Leaves of Grass.' He has also, we hear,
         completed several magazine pieces for publishers in London,
         a quarter where his productions appear to be in demand. A
         small prose book by him, 'Democratic Vistas,' will probably
         appear the ensuing winter. As we understand, Mr. Whitman
         returns to Washington all the more robust and healthy from
         his vacation, and with the prospect and purpose, in the
         leisurely way usual for him, of considerable literary work
         in the future."</span><br><br>
