   <p>First thank you for your good affectionate letter, inspiriting more than you
      knew—That seems to me too long, condensed, dwelling a pull proof reading
      work—pressing work too on the <u>delication</u> of the
      brain
   </p>
   
   <p>—I had a friend a woman of 30 a <u>counter</u> in the
      Redemption Bureau in the Treasury—told me she was "going to the devil fast
      &amp; steady" (her own description) from her dense
      brain‑exhausting‑dulling labors, till she adopted the plan of getting a
      10 or 12 minutes' nap (sleep or even doze) at noon or one oclock every day, just
      leaning down at her desk—fortunately she <u>could</u> fall
      in her nap—wh' is the great part of it—at any rate it cured<sup><a href="#upa.00094_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>—I heard from Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> to-day<sup><a href="#upa.00094_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—he sends me the enclosed little slip<sup><a href="#upa.00094_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> from
      O'C<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r5">5</a></sup>—the condition is bad, &amp; I feel pretty gloomy
      ab't my best friend—yet he has great vitality &amp; may tide over
      it—
   </p>    
   
   <p>—Nothing very different with me—Dr Ostler<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r6">6</a></sup> (very
      'cute, a natural physician, rather optimistic, but best so)—thinks I am either
      on a very good way, or substantially cured of this last attack—I only wish I
      could <u>feel</u> so, or even approximate it—But any how
      thank God so far my thoughts &amp; mental power are entirely within my
      control—I have written a short letter to <u>Critic</u> (by
      their request) on the "poet" question (wh' they may print)<sup><a href="#upa.00094_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup>—My sister—George's wife<sup><a href="#upa.00094_n6" id="r8">8</a></sup>—has just paid me a
      good cheery visit (with some nice home made Graham biscuits)—So I get along
      well, am comfortable, have a fair appetite, &amp; keep a good oak fire—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>This letter is addressed to two
      close acquaintances of Whitman: William Sloane Kennedy (1850–1929), a writer and defender
      of the poet, and the
      naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921). For more on these figures, see these entries
      from <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998): Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>" and Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John (1837–1921) and Ursula (1836–1917)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00094_n2">1. Kennedy wrote on : "Mrs. K. is in Boston at a Symphony
      Concert and a precious ½ hour for my soul being at my disposal I feel a
      strong inner impulse to pour out here in the evening solitude, my heart to you
      in a genuine heart-letter of affection, welling up out of the deeps you long ago
      touched as no other ever did or can. Dear friend whom I have for so long
      admired, do you not feel that all is well with you &amp; the great cause of
      freedom for which you have laid down yr life? I do. I feel somehow that the
      future is going to be with you, with us. Humanity is sweeping on into the larger
      light. To me who have drank at all fountains of literature the world over, &amp;
      climbed the lonely peaks of thought in every land &amp; age, your <em>Leaves of Grass</em> still towers up above everything else in
      grand aspiration, right philosophy, &amp; the heart-beats of true liberty."
      Kennedy went on to complain that he was "really ill with hard work—nerves
      trembling, eye fluttering &amp; above all sleepy."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="upa.00094_n4">4. A brief note from
      William D. O'Connor to Bucke on October 20, 1888 mentioned that "a month ago my right
      eye
      closed, and the lid had not yet lifted, spite of battery. So I am practically
      blind" (University of Pennsylvania). Whitman tells Kennedy and Burroughs that
      this letter had been enclosed with the letter he received from Bucke on October 23,
      1888.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">5. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4302">6. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on
      Osler, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitman-dev.unl.edu/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_202.html">Osler, Dr. William (1849–1919)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on the relationship of Osler and
      Whitman, see Michael Bliss, <em>William Osler: A Life in
         Medicine</em> (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="upa.00094_n6">8. Whitman is referring to his brother, George

   <p id="upa.00094_n1">9. This postscript appears 
      at the top of the first page of the letter. On the
      verso of this letter, Kennedy has written a letter to Burroughs dated October 25,
      1888,
      as well as a second note, dated October 26, 1888.<a href="#r9">[back]
