      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I intended to have written you yesterday but did not have an opportunity. Everything
      is going along all right with us except Andrew is real sick with his throat.<sup><a href="#loc.00404_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> He cannot talk at all and eats but with the greatest agony. He has had some doctor
      attending him that I think has treated him very badly. I am going to have him have
      an interview with Dr Ruggles<sup><a href="#loc.00404_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> this Eve, and hope he will be able to do something for him at once. Andrew, himself,
      seems to think that he is a gone case, but I cannot think as badly of him as that.
      I will write you again tomorrow what Ruggles says.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother received your last letter with the shin plasters all right, and in regard to
      your papers, Mss &amp;c they are all carefully put up, everything, even the smallest scrap
      is packed up so you will certainly find everything that you left at home all right<sup><a href="#loc.00404_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>About George. We do not hear from him. He wrote mother that he would certainly write
      her again befor he left Newport News and as long as she did not hear from him she might be sure that
      he was there. I have an idea that the 51st were left behind, although it is hard to
      tell about it. I should write to George to-day if I <em>knew</em> that he was still down to Newport News.<sup><a href="#loc.00404_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> Walt I should like to have letters from you much oftener &nbsp;I am real sorry to hear that the trouble in your head has again made its appearence. I can tell how you must feel for I am having something of the same kind myself but
      in a much milder form than you are. Dr Ruggles has been quite sick with the same thing
      but has recovered. Indeed almost everyone that I know has had a bad time with cold
      &amp;c in the head. I hope dear Walt that you will speedily recover. Mother is as well
      as usual &nbsp;Mattie is also quite well. We have not heard from Han for some little time.
      I suppose that she is about the same and I fear that she will be a long time in getting
      well.<sup><a href="#loc.00404_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Hattie is as well and interesting as usual. Yesterday she had an immensely bad fall
      on the back part of her head. She was sitting in the chair at the sewing machine and reached over to get a small piece of stuff to stitch, leaned too far and fell
      striking the back part of her head pretty hard against the frame of the Extension
      table leaves &nbsp;We bathed her head for a long time with cold water and this morning
      although the swelling was not all gone she appeared abt as well as usual. I was much frightened though at first I can tell you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt do you ever have a chance to get hold of any of the scientific reports that Uncle
      Sam prints. Would it be possible for you to obtain a copy of the Pacific R. R. Exploration
      &amp;c Reports.<sup><a href="#loc.00404_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> I should like much to get hold of anything in that line, and would be much obliged
      to you if you could get them for me. I find them of great use in giving me ideas about
      my business and they are too cursed costly to buy &nbsp;Look around you and if you catch
      anything send it along will you
   </p>
   
   <p>I will write you again to-morrow</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00404_n1">1. For Andrew's illness,
      see Jeff's letter to Walt dated .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00404_n2">2. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Jeff and Mattie Whitman. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest
      in his practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles
      Gems" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:90, n. 85).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00404_n3">3. On , Walt wrote in a letter to his
      mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman: "Mother, when you or Jeff writes again, tell
      me if my papers &amp; MSS are all right—I should be very sorry indeed if they
      got scattered, or used up or any thing—<em>especially</em> the
      copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> covered in blue paper, and the
      little MS book 'Drum Taps,' &amp; the MS tied up in the square, spotted
      (stone-paper) loose covers—I want them all carefully kept."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00404_n4">4. As part of General
      Burnside's Ninth Army, George's regiment, the Fifty-first New York, left Newport
      News, Virginia, on March 26, 1863, and travelled to Paris, Kentucky, arriving on
      April 1, 1863 (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <em>Civil War Letters of
         George Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1975],
      90).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00404_n5">5. Hannah, a
      hypochondriac, complained for decades of ill health, yet she outlived her entire
      immediate family.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00404_n6">6. Jeff uses the popular
      name for the series issued by the U.S. War Department and prepared under the
      supervision of the U.S. Engineer Department, Topographical Bureau, <em>Reports of Explorations and Surveys, to Ascertain the Most
         Practicable and Economical Route for a Railroad From the Mississippi River
         to the Pacific Ocean</em>, 12 vols. (Washington, D.C.: A. O. P. Nicholson,
      1855–60). Although an earlier edition of these reports was published in a
      four-volume octavo in 1854, Jeff's later references to this work indicate he
      means the twelve-volume quarto edition. See his letter to Walt from .<a href="#r6">[back]
