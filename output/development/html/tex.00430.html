      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother has just received
      your letter<sup><a href="#tex.00349_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      and I<sup><a href="#tex.00349_n7" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      thought I would answer
      it for her as she wanted me too. (Yesterday
      she had not a very good day, but to
      day she is better, and she does not want
      you to weary about her nor to come on
      until you fell it will be no injury to
      you. The doctor ordered her some new
      medicine yesterday, which I hope will
      do her good. She had some appetite, does
      not relish her food much though. George<sup><a href="#duk.00425_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      got some good whisky, and she takes
      that occasionally, when she feels badly, and
      it does her good. She is sitting up, sewing
      a little.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00349_n3">1. The letter from Walt that
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman "just received" is probably his  letter.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00349_n7">2. George Washington Whitman
      married Louisa Orr Haslam (1842–1892), called "Loo" or "Lou," in spring
      1871, and they lived in Camden at 322 Stevens Street.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
