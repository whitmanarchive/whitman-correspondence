   </p>
   
   
   <p>My sister told me at breakfast to say to you she would be happy to have you come over
      Saturday p m &amp; spend the night, &amp; take a ride Sunday, if agreeable to you—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Bee I have been thinking much the few hours past of what Mr Eldridge told me of a
      young Mrs Needham (an intimate friend of my Washington friends, &amp; two years ago a
      fine healthy woman of 26) who too overwhelmingly swamped herself as a student at your
      Phila: medical school, a year &amp; a half since (crowding too much &amp; too intense study into
      too short a time) resulting in terrible brain troubles &amp; a general caving in, &amp; now
      
      
      (as Mr E told me last night on our journey down) of <u>death lately in a lunatic asylum</u>—just from sheer overwork, &amp; too intense concentration, ardor, &amp; continued strain<sup><a href="#upa.00059_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>—My own trouble is an illustration of the same danger, &amp; I feel peculiarly sensible
      of it in others near to me<sup><a href="#upa.00059_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00059_n1">1. Beatrice was a medical
      student. Whitman was almost clairvoyant: Beatrice committed suicide in 1881 (see
      Whitman's letter to Harry Stafford on ).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00059_n2">2. Here Whitman gave the
      more plausible explanation of his paralysis and physical collapse; for public
      consumption, however, he invariably attributed his ailments to infections
      received during his visits to the wartime hospitals.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00059_n3">3. According to Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, Whitman spent most evenings with the Gilchrists from December
      10 to 30, and had Christmas dinner with them. In December Whitman introduced the
      Gilchrists to Joaquin Miller and took them on December 27 to see Miller's play,
      <em>The Danites</em>, at the Walnut Street Theatre (<em>The Commonplace Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.). Whitman himself had attended the opening of the play on December 24; see
      Miller's  letter to Whitman (see also
      Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York:
      Mitchell Kennerley, 1914], 3:225). Herbert Gilchrist reported that at a tea
      given by his mother Miller exclaimed upon Whitman's arrival: "He looks like a
      god, to-night" (<em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>,
      ed. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist [London: T.F. Unwin, 1887], 231).<a href="#r3">[back]
