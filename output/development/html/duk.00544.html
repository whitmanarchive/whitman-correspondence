   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00544_n16">1. This letter dates to a
      Thursday in May 1868. Neither Walt Whitman's reply to this letter, nor any
      letter to his mother between his  and his 
      letters survive. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to May 14, 1868, but
      this date cannot be directly confirmed. Nonetheless, Clarence Gohdes and
      Rollo G. Silver accepted Bucke's date (<em>Faint Clews &amp;
         Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 195–196), and Edwin
      Haviland Miller cited their date (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:374). The date, nonetheless, remains uncertain.<br><br>
       May 14 fell on Thursday in 1868, but the letter may date to a Thursday that
      preceded or followed in the same month. May seems to be consistent with the
      efforts of Jane McClure (Louisa's "maquire") to remove Andrew Jackson
      Whitman's children from the care of his widow Nancy McClure and place them
      in an orphan asylum, a topic to which Louisa Van Velsor Whitman returned in
      her  letter to Walt Whitman. Jane
      McClure was the sister-in-law of Nancy. Louisa wrote in late June that Jane
      McClure inquired whether "cornell had been to see me about the children."
      This "cornell" is the same James Cornwell who had been a close friend of
      Louisa's son Andrew before his death in 1863.<br><br>
      This letter could date even earlier because a brief mention of removing James
      "Jimmy" Whitman and a request to "write that man" appeared in Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman.
      Louisa in this letter asked (almost begged) Walt to write Cornwell. The
      impetus for James Cornwell's visit to Louisa about Andrew and Nancy's
      children was presumably the letter from Walt that Louisa requested. Walt,
      however, did not mention Nancy McClure's children or the letter to Cornwell
      when he acknowledged receipt of letters from his mother in his  or his  letters. The intensified
      efforts appear to date to May and June. Louisa's request for a letter to
      Cornwell by the end of the month presumably makes May 28, the last Thursday
      of the month, the last possible date for this letter.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00544_n9">2. Jane McClure, whose last
      name Louisa Van Velsor Whitman here wrote as "maquire," was the sister-in-law of
      Nancy McClure, the widow of Louisa's son Andrew Jackson Whitman. Jane was
      married to Nancy's brother Edward McClure, a janitor in the Brooklyn courthouse.
      For the identification of McClure as Nancy's maiden name, see Jerome M. Loving,
      ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975), 12, n. 32.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00544_n1">3. Nancy McClure Whitman was
      the wife of Walt Whitman's brother, Andrew Jackson Whitman. James "Jimmy" and
      George "Georgy" were Nancy and Andrew's sons, and Nancy was pregnant with
      Andrew, Jr., when her husband died in December 1863. This letter has the only
      known information about the twins born to Nancy in 1868. George Washington
      Whitman and his wife Louisa Orr Haslam briefly cared for Jimmy and Georgy in
      late 1871 and early 1872, but traces of them are lost aside from Georgy's death
      in late 1872. For Andrew's wife and children, see Jerome M. Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> [Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975], 13–14.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00544_n10">4. James H. Cornwell, a friend
      of Andrew Jackson Whitman, secured Andrew a job in North Carolina in 1863
      building fortifications, and he assisted the Whitman family during Andrew's
      funeral. After being discharged from the Union Army in December 1864, Cornwell
      returned to his position as a judge in the Brooklyn City Hall. He is mentioned
      in Whitman's "Scenes in a Police Justices' Court Room" (<em>Brooklyn Daily Times</em>, September 9, 1857). For the relationship between
      Andrew and Cornwell, see Martin G. Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 10 (Winter 1993),
      142–148.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00544_n13">5. On behalf of which
      Andrew Louisa Van Velsor Whitman made this request to Walt Whitman is
      unclear. She most likely asked Walt to write Cornwell on behalf of the
      memory of Walt's brother Andrew Jackson Whitman, who died in 1863, for the
      sake of his three children. Presumably this is what she intended because
      also referred to "the 3 children" and indicated a plan to share the
      financial burden of caring for them with the McClures. But she may have
      asked on behalf of Walt's nephew, Andrew, Jr., who was born to Nancy McClure
      after Andrew's death.<br><br>
      The Home of the Friendless only accepted children up to the age of eleven, so
      Andrew, Jr., was the only child eligible for long-term assistance through
      that institution. This effort to remove Nancy's children was unsuccessful.
      Andrew, Jr., aged 5 years, was run over in the street and killed the
      following autumn (see Walt's 
      letter to Louisa).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00544_n2">6. The Home of the Friendless
      was constructed in 1847 by the American Female Guardian Society "to protect,
      befriend, and to train to virtue and usefulness to those whom no one seemed to
      have thought or pity." The asylum took in orphaned or homeless children under
      the age of 11. It was located on 30th Street between Park Avenue South and
      Madison (see Moses King, <em>King's Handbook of New York City</em>
      [Boston: Moses King, 1892], 396).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00544_n3">7. Edward McClure was the
      brother of Nancy McClure, Andrew Jackson Whitman's widow. See Jerome M. Loving,
      ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> [Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975], 12, n. 32.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00544_n4">8. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's report of Janey McClure's recommendation deploys somewhat cryptic
      syntax, but her intent can be summarized as follows: If Nancy McClure's
      children were removed from her care by a legal process, taken "the proper
      way," then the children could be placed into ("can be got in") the Home of
      the Friendless. The concern that Nancy would be able to remove her children
      from an orphanage is consistent with Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman, in which she stated her own and
      the McClures' preference that Nancy's children be placed in the Brooklyn
      Home for Destitute Children, the "only place that [Nancy] couldent get them
      out." The word "it" in the phrase "proper way it taken" may be an error for
      the intended word "is," the transcription offered by Clarence Gohdes and
      Rollo G. Silver (<em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections:
         Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina:
      Duke University Press, 1949], 196).<br><br>
      Louisa's son George Washington Whitman and his wife Louisa Orr Haslam briefly
      cared for Andrew and Nancy's sons James "Jimmy" and George "Georgy" in late
      1871, though it is unclear why Nancy released her two sons into their
      custody (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  and  letters to
      Walt). The son born to Nancy after the death of her husband Andrew in 1863,
      Andrew, Jr., died after he was run over by a brewery wagon in 1868, and
      Georgy died in 1872.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00544_n11">9. The spelling "Edwar" is an
      incomplete correction. Louisa began to write "Edd," as she spelled her son
      Edward's name, and then she wrote the letter "w" for "Edward" (Janey McClure's
      husband) over the second "d" in her original assay. The name "Edwar" has the "w"
      over the original and now stricken letter "d." Gohdes and Silver transcribed the
      name "Eddwar" (<em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of
         Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University
      Press, 1949], 196).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00544_n5">10. Edward McClure worked as a
      janitor in the courthouse. See Jerome M. Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> [Durham,

   <p id="duk.00425_n13">11. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r11">[back]
