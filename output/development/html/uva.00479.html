   <p>I am in about my usual general health (which is nothing to brag of) but my locomotion
      is worse—had a fall a month ago &amp; turned my ankle in, &amp; at my age one
      dont recover from such things—Have no thought of coming to New York—If I
      did so, I should willingly give your friend the sittings for portrait.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Watson Gilder
      (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <em>The Century</em>, from 1881 until his death. Whitman had met
      Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1955], 482). Whitman attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
      Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the <em>New York Tribune</em>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder
      one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
      delirium" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">Sunday, August 5, 1888</a>). For more about Gilder, see Susan L.
      Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_95.html">Gilder, Richard Watson (1844–1909)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00479_n1">1. Since Gilder's letter to
      Whitman is not extant, it is not possible to determine who the artist was.
      Perhaps it was John White Alexander. See the letter from Whitman to Alexander,
