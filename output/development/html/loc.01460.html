   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hasten to reply to your letter of the 2nd which came to hand just last night, and
      I
      must confess cheered me for I had been expecting its arrival for some weeks, and was
      growing somewhat dubious my letter and package had gone astray, but thanks to the
      powers that be they have reached you all safely, and seemed to have been cheering
      and welcome 
      to

      to
      
       from Bronchial 
      Ashma
      
      , and it makes me somewhat doleful at times, so that I often feel in dread
      when I write letters I write them [

      to
      
      : Well it was very gratifying to learn and see you 
      where
      
       still able to write a little, and work also a little—glad and
      welcome news that I could be a subscriber direct to you: our Ruskin here publishes
      his own Books, and how he does I will let you know 
      bye
      
       and

      parson and Chaplain to a Queen was good news to read to a Democrat. I loved the man.
      I loved his works. I honoured him for what he had attempted to do for the people,
      years ago, when Democracy was not so respectable. I mean to send you his portrait.
      he was a fine noble healthy looking man, fine read and Whiteflesh, like a Cultured
      farmer or Fisherman and had a large big hand and heart and stood somewhat your 
      hight
      
      . as near as I can guess fine blue gray Eyes. I met him 3 years ago. we had
      often promised to 
      me
      
      , but alas never did so but that once: then only for an hour or two. Yet
      how full of sublime love and true fellowship the time passed.

      your works—and one copy of the two Rivulets (I want it to give to the writer
      of the letter I sent you on your Essay on Burns) I note you the Editions I have of

      in America would cease to be so doleful about you, and your Works let them who love
      you cherish, and aid the sale of this Edition and all other Editions then let the
      world, the newspaper, the other Authors and great men go their way, and do their

      love Carlyle. for years he made no sign, but waited and the Sun
      shone at last. let us all be content to wait. let us do our very best who are
      believers to aid and help our singers. but in silence I feel glad Joaquin Miller
      calls to see you. I love the man. I love a deal he has written, especially 
      is
      
       life amongst the Modocs.

       a little band here loves him too his ride to Brazos struck a fire that has
      grown to a white heat with us all. I copied a lot of his account of the Indians and
      their treatment and the pollution of the Rivers and sent it to Ruskin—he was
      deeply interested with it and said he had no idea that the pollution of your
      beautiful stream had also taken place

   <p>he intends to make use of my tracts some day. Shake hands with Miller for me. tell
      I
      yearn to see him—and to own his portrait. tell him I have his Wife's noble
      defence of him. that I have read it often to friends here. I hope some day I may see
      you all and shake your hands and talk a little too. I was glad to learn Tennyson has
      still corresponded with you, and that he writes you so Kindly too. I love him for
      the noble poems he has written and for his noble heart, for years ago
       he sent me many kind letters
      of deep sympathy and friendships when I first commenced to do work for my fellow
      workman. Conway too is a fine noble fellow. the others I dont
      know but I feel glad to see despite the [

   <p>I see them now while I write this. I look into [
      <span class="unclear">thine?</span>]
       eyes. I grasp thy hand. thou grasps it <u>hard</u>. thou looks upon me with a smile. I hear thee say:
      "All is peace now young man the storm is indeed past I live once again in the Souls
      and memories of those 
      Hero's
      
       and all is Well!" Oh could I tell thee my feeling when I read that which
      thou tells me of "[
      <span class="unclear">Lincoln?</span>]
      "—I loved the man, though I never knew him. Ruskin once
      wrote me a Note (when I told him what a noble soul he was) "how is it, this was
      never 
      Know
      
       until now?" that was at his Death. I soon let him know from printed matter
      &amp; had by me how it was I loved the man. he wrote and thanked me, and then said
      he was indeed glad to know your people had been blessed with such a man, and he then
      deeply regretted his sad end for your 
      peoples
      
       sake. —

      so I tell thee this to cheer thee: and to show thee though silent, thou livest still
      warm in my heart and in all the hearts of our little land: one letter I send thee,
      which I hope will please thee: for it is written by one I love dear.

   <p>I enclose thee

       portrait, so that thou may know him also. I send also some M.S.S. that I
      have had copied from Canon Kingsley's works especially for you by another of the
      circle. it seemed strange the very passages I noted to be done was selected by you
      
      to
      
       for your "two Rivulets" I send it altogether simply because I did not care
      to [
      <span class="unclear">disjoint?</span>]
      : also it
      seemed that there is a deep bond of sympathy between us—when we both should
      unknown to each other have both selected the same passage. I got a nice poem from
      W.J. Linton: I felt sorry it did not give me his
      address—I had it reprinted in one of our local papers it seems to have made an
      impression on some of our people: I would like to have sent to him a copy of the
      paper had I 
      
       address: I also would like to introduce to him a young friend of  mine that is in New
      York: the son of a Quaker of Manchester: a fine noble fellow who died very suddenly
      to our sad loss for he was a noble soul, full of good broad liberal ideas with the
      power to give expression to them: a fighter in all good causes. his son seems a
      noble fellow—and I would so like him to know a man like Linton or any such
      soul. I feel I would like to make my young friend Know to some good souls for I
      think there is stuff in him. so if you can aid me in my wish it will help to
      [
      <span class="unclear">knit?</span>]
       the firmer our
      bonds of unity and love, and he may someday go and see you, and then our love will
      still be dearer for I advised him to go to America, so that I feel deeply interested
      in him &amp; his welfare—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>He seems a fine lad to me and I could rejoice exceedingly if he should visit you,
      for
      I yearn to hear what either you or any soul like you, would think of him. I often
      think I would like to visit America. in fact to settle in it: How much 
      mony
      
       would it take to buy [
      <span class="unclear">travel?</span>]
      ? for a fellow to live on decently? I of course am no Farmer,
      but I would like to live a Farmer's life and 
      dont
      
       see any chance here. Land's so dear, I am only a bad sailor or else I
      would have been on my way to see you this year: I often have long wished to see your
      country and its people, and I yearned to see it and them just in the way you have
      done—so you see I see them through your eyes and so love them all and you

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Dixon (1831–1880), a corkcutter of
      Sunderland, England, was one of Walt Whitman's early English admirers. In 1856
      he had bought copies of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> from a book
      peddler; one of these copies was later sent by William B. Scott to William
      Michael Rossetti. Dixon vigorously supported cultural projects and represented
      the ideal laborer of John Ruskin, who printed many of his own letters to the
      corkcutter in <em>Time and Tide</em> (1867). See <em>Autobiographical Notes of the Life of William Bell Scott</em>, ed. W. Minto
      (1892), II, 32–33, 267–269; Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt
         Whitman in England</em> (1934), 15–17; <em>The Works of
         John Ruskin</em>, ed. E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn (1905), XVII,
