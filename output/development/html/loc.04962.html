   <p>D<u>r</u> Johnston<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r1">1</a></sup> has told you about the
      "Surprise Party" he received on his birthday—the 8<u>th</u>
      inst!—I, myself, was unable to attend it, + Hulton is away from home at
      present, but all the rest of the [
      <span class="unclear">friends?</span>]
       were there + [
      <span class="unclear">had?</span>]
       a "good time."  One of our friends—W.
      Dixon—contributed two songs (with choruses) of which I afterwards asked for
      copies. I received them today + read them at noon for the first time. It occurred
      to
      me as I read them that they might possibly afford <u>you</u> a
      slight momentary amusement, + I will send them on with this. As you will see, they haven't much merit
      or value but you will note the reference to D<u>r</u> Johnston's
      visit to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>One line saying that Dr. J. "triumphantly has shown us a hair from off your beard!"
      requires explanation. In a letter he received from you he saw (and appropriated) a
      white hair attached to the mucilage of the envelope.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope that you are better than when you last wrote, and am anxious to hear a better
      report.
   </p>
   
   <p>The weather here has been very cold and frosty for a week back, and now threatens
      snow.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
