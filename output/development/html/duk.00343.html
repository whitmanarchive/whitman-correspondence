      <br xmlns="" class="opener">July 23d/63
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I take the first oppertunity I have had in some time, to let you know that I am well
      and hearty.<sup><a href="#duk.00343_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup> I fear Mother that you have been somewhat worried about not hearing from me in so
      long, but we have been so situated that there was no chance to send letters away,
      even if we had a chance to write them. I got a letter from Walt, a few days ago, dated
      July 5th, &nbsp;he tells me you have another Sissy<sup><a href="#duk.00343_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> at your house, &nbsp;I only hope she is as smart and bright as Sissy No. One.
   </p>
   
   <p>We returned to camp this morning after about as hard a campaign of 19 days as I want
      to see. We are now back in the same camp we occupied before the fall of Vicksburg,
      &nbsp;this is the position where we expected to whip Johnson,<sup><a href="#duk.00343_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> if he had attempted to come to the relief of Pemberton,<sup><a href="#duk.00343_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &nbsp;We are between the Yazoo and Black rivers and about 7 miles directly in the rear of
      Vicksburg. Our whole corps were encamped around here, before the surrender of Vicksburg,
      and we had dug miles of rifle pitts, and would have had a big thing on Johnson if we could have got him to come here
      and give us a fight. Vicksburg you reccolect surrendered on the morning of July 4th, and on the afternoon of the same day, we
      started off to find Johnson, as it was certain he would not come here to us. After
      a march of about 10 miles, our advance came up to the enemys pickets, who were posted on the opposite side of the Big Black river, (a deep creek
      about 100 feet wide) &nbsp;as soon as we came in sight the rebel pickets skeedadled, and
      we had to stop and wait, (nearly two days) untill a bridge was built, before we could cross. As soon as the bridge was ready we pushed on after the rebs, the dust laying in the road like flour, 4 or 5 inches thick,
      and the weather terrible hot, &nbsp;quite a number of the men fell down in the ranks, from
      the effects of the sun, and there was considerable suffering from the scarscity of water and we were forced to drink, from any little pond that could be found by
      the way no matter how bad the water was. Grub to was mighty scarce, and green corn
      was the chief article of food.
   </p>
   
   <p>The enemy did not pretend to make a stand, untill they got behind their entrenchments at Jackson, &nbsp;this City you know is the Capitol
      of the state and is built on the bank of the Pearl river, &nbsp;their earthworks started
      from the river above the town and ran along the outskirts untill they struck the river again just below the city, makeing a line of about 3 miles in length. The enemy were supposed to be from 25 to 30,000 strong and on the afternoon
      of July Tenth we drove their skirmishers, inside of their entrenchments, and we threw
      forward a heavy line of skirmishers, reaching nearly the whole length of the enemys line, and within easy rifle range of the enemys works. Each Brigade had a certain part of the line, and the regts, releived each other every 24 hours &nbsp;that is, the ones that were up to the front one day, were
      moved back a short distance, the next, and held in reserve, but had to be ready, at
      any moment to fall in and sometimes when we heard heavy fireing, we had to fall in two or three times during the night. It seemed very curious fighting
      to me, and very different from what we had been used to. There was no general engagement
      but during the day, and sometimes during the night, quite a brisk fire was kept by sharpshooters
      on each side, &nbsp;Each party kept themselvs concealed as much as possible, the enemy behind their earthworks, and our side behind
      trees, and by laying flat on the ground, and the moment anyone showed themselvs there was two or three rifles pointed at them. I expected Gen. Sherman (who I believe
      had command on our side) intended to skirmish with them, and keep them buisy on this side of the river, while someone crossed the river, and made an attack on
      the rear, which of course would have cutt off their retreat, but for some probably good reason (that I know nothing about)
      nothing of the kind was attempted, as far as I can hear. The skirmish was kept up
      untill about daylight on the morning of the 17th when a white flag was run up, by some citazens on one of the rebel works and we soon found that the whole rebel force had skedaddled
      during the night, and we went in and occupied the place. Our Brigade<sup><a href="#duk.00343_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> was the first troops inside the town, and the 51st was the second Regt.<sup><a href="#duk.00343_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> We found the place very much damaged by our Artillery, and nearly deserted by the
      inhabitants, what few citazens we found had dug holes or burrows in the ground and there they had staid while the
      fighting was going on. The loss on our side, has been very light indeed and our regt.
      only had one man wounded, &nbsp;we took three or four hundred prisoners, and quite a large
      number of rifles and considerable ammunition fell into our hands. (Soon after we entered
      the town the western troops began to come in, and they ransacked and plundered the town completely. The western armies burn and destroy every thing they
      come across and the same number of men, marching through the country, will do three
      times the damage of the army of the Potomac. Sometimes on the march, I have known
      them to break and destroy, the most costly furniture such as Pianos and Sofas, and
      I have seen the roads strewn with the most splendid bound books, that would be taken
      from the libraries, carried a little distance and thrown away.)<sup><a href="#duk.00343_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> The planters had generaly left their houses, (when they found the yanks were comeing,) leaving darkies in charge, and the troops would often burn the houses, and the
      darkies would run away, and follow the sogers. We traveled through thousands of acres of corn, and sometimes 4 or 5,000 men with
      two or three hundred horses and mules would bivouac in a corn field. When we left here we only took the
      clothes we had on &nbsp;leaving our trunks here in camp, and two or three times I have
      went to a pond and took off my clothes and washed them myself, and two or three times
      I have been completely soaked with the rain, and laid down at night on the ground,
      (after drinking a cup of coffe and eating a cracker) and slept soundly all night, and got up at 4 O clock next morning
      feeling first rate, and I am now as well as ever I was in my life. We dont know how long we will stay here, or which way we will move next, but the general
      impression is, that we will start back for Kentucky in the course of a few days, so
      I think very likely the next letter you have from me will be from Kentucky. [You sent]
      me a letter that you had received from Hannah. Poor Hann, O how I should like to see
      her, &nbsp;I was very glad to hear from her, but very, very, sory to hear that she was recovering from her sickness so slowly. I was expecting to hear
      that she, was about comeing home &nbsp;I feel certain if she was only well enough to come home, that she would soon
      be well. Mother, you must urge her to come on just as soon as she is well enough to
      stand the journey.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have seen a New York Herald, as late as July 9th &nbsp;it seems, that the Army of the
      Potomac, has at last done something pretty nice, &nbsp;the paper speaks as though the capture
      of Lee's Army was certain, but we have had him in a tight spot so often before that
      I cant help thinking that he will manage some way to get off. Walt seems to be getting
      along very well there in Washington. Andrew he says did not go to Newbern.<sup><a href="#duk.00343_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> I am glad to hear that he is getting better of his throat disease. I hope Mother, when we get back to
      Kentucky that I shall hear from you again often. Mattie and the baby, Walt says &nbsp;are
      getting along finely. Mother I hope you are well, &nbsp;you must take things easy this
      hot weather &nbsp;Tell Jeff to write to me often and let me know how things are getting
      along at home &nbsp;and Mother, you must write yourself as often as you can get a chance.
   </p>
   
   <p>I see by Walts letter that you have received the 200 dollars that I sent you at last
      pay.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00343_n100">1. The final destination of
      Burnside's Ninth Corps was supposed to have been East Tennessee, where it would
      have assisted General Rosecrans in his move against Chattanooga. On June 2,
      1863, however, Burnside received a dispatch from Washington requesting him to
      support General Grant in his siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Leaving Burnside
      behind with his own Department of Ohio, the Ninth Corps, under the command of
      General John Parke, departed from Stanford (with the Fifty-First New York
      Regiment) on June 4, 1863 and arrived in the area of Vicksburg about June 15,
      1863—in time to support the Union forces there. Shortly after the surrender of
      Vicksburg on July 4, 1863, the Ninth Corps was assigned to the Expeditionary
      Army of General Sherman. During the next eleven days, this force—in what Walt
      Whitman would later describe as a "tough little campaign" ("Fifty-First New York
      City Veterans," <em>The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt
         Whitman</em>, edited by Emory Holloway, [Garden City, New York: Doubleday,
      Page and Company, 1921] 2:39)—pushed the Johnston army, then encamped near the
      Big Black River, back through Jackson, Mississippi, which the Union force
      occuped on July 17, 1863 (see ).<a href="#r1">[back]

      occupied Jackson, the capital of Mississippi, on May 14, 1863, shortly after the
      Confederate forces had fled. On May 16 and 17, 1863, Grant defeated the Forces
      of Pemberton in the battles of Champion Hill and Big Black River Bridge. Hence,
      Johnston, near Jackson, and Pemberton, defending Vicksburg, were divided; and
