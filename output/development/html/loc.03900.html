      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend Susan &amp; Dear friends all
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are having an awful spell of weather up here, snow-storms &amp; bitter cold ever
      since Christmas—about the wintriest week I remember take it all
      through—thermometer down below zero, night &amp; day—But I suppose you
      know all about it &amp; have had the same—I still keep well &amp; in good
      trim, thank the Lord—eat my Christmas dinner &amp; spent the evening at the
      Baptist minister's here, Mr Lung,<sup><a href="#loc.03900_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> a grand wife, &amp; a big family all home to dinner
      seven children two grown—had a good time—haven't been out any where else particular
      for a
      month—in fact the storms &amp; snow &amp; bad walking keep me
      weatherbound—rec'd
      
       two more letters from Herbert<sup><a href="#loc.03900_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>—he has sent you by mail two big books,
      the <u>Life of Blake</u>,<sup><a href="#loc.03900_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> he sent them to me to take to
      you—they are quite valuable &amp; curious books—I think the first
      time George or Van or Mont comes up they had better stop here &amp; get
      them—Herbert also sent me a P.O. order for a small sum, asking me to get
      something for your children for Christmas—I have not yet cashed it at the P.O.—Mrs
      G appears to be about well again—
   </p>
   
   <p>It is now
      12½ Sunday—it is moderated, &amp; the sun has come out—my sister
      has just come home from church—All goes on about as usual here—New
      Year's day was rather flat, all around, so bleak &amp; cold &amp; deep snow—Still the women
      are out in their finery, plenty of them—I believe some would
      parade out in their new bonnets &amp; pretties if it froze their noses off—George, dear
      friend, how are you getting along this winter?—did you get the new
      cider—&amp; is any of it left?—I suppose Mont and Van are stout &amp;
      jolly as ever—have you had any sleigh riding boys?—Susan I sent you a
      little book &amp; one to Kate—did they come?—I want to see you all but I
      don't know when I shall come down.
   </p>
