   <p>R Worthington 770 Broadway New York about a year ago bo't at auction the electrotype plates (456 pages) of the 1860–'61 edition of my book
      <u>Leaves of Grass</u>—plates originally made by a young firm <u>Thayer &amp; Eldridge</u> under my supervision there and then in Boston, (in the spring of 1860, on an agreement
      running five years.) A small edition was printed and issued at the time, but in six
      months or thereabout Thayer &amp; Eldridge failed, and these plates were stored away and
      nothing further done;—till about a year ago (latter part of 1879) they were put up
      in N Y city by Leavitt, auctioneer, &amp; bought in by said Worthington. (Leavitt, before putting
      them up, wrote to me offering the plates for sale. I wrote back that said plates were
      worthless, being superseded by a larger &amp; different edition—that I could not use them,
      the 1860 ones, myself, nor would I allow them to be used by any one else—I being the
      sole owner of the copyright.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>However it seems Leavitt did auction them &amp; Worthington bo't them (I suppose for a mere song)—W. then wrote to me offering $250 if I would add
      something to the text &amp; authenticate the plates, to be published in a book by him.
      I wrote back (I was in St Louis at the time, helpless, sick) thanking him for the
      offer, regretting he had purchased the plates, refusing the proposal, &amp; forbidding
      any use of the plates. Then &amp; since I thought the matter had dropt. But I have to
      add that about September 1880 (I was in London
       
      
      
      Canada at the time) I wrote to Worthington, referring to his previous offer, then
      declined by me, and asking whether he still had the plates &amp; was disposed to make
      the same offer; to which I rec'd no answer. I wrote a second time; and again no answer.<sup><a href="#hyb.00015_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I had supposed the whole thing dropt, &amp; nothing done, but within a week past, I learn
      that Worthington has been slyly printing and selling the Volume of <u>Leaves of Grass</u> from those plates (must have commenced early in 1880) and is now printing and selling
      it. On Nov. 22, 1880, I found the book, (printed from those plates,) at Porter &amp; Coates' store,
      cor: 9th &amp; Chestnut Sts. Philadelphia. P &amp; C told me they procured it from Worthington,
      &amp; had been so procuring it off &amp; on, for nearly a year.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>First I want Worthington effectually stopt from issuing the books. Second I want my
      royalty for all he has sold, (though I have no idea of ever getting a cent.) Third
      I want W. taken hold of, if possible, on criminal proceeding.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am the sole owner of the copyright—&amp; I think my copyright papers are all complete—I
      publish &amp; sell the book myself—it is my sole means of living—what Worthington has
      done has already been a serious detriment to me.—Mr Eldridge, (of the Boston firm
      alluded to) is accessible in Washington D C—will corroborate first parts of the foregoing—(is
      my friend)

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="hyb.00015_n1">1. Whitman's account of
      his dealings with Richard Worthington ("Holy Dick" was the poet's epithet
      later), a New York publisher, is somewhat garbled. (Whitman's version in
      1888 was filled with inaccuracies; see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906],
      1:195–196, 250–251). Worthington bought the plates of the 1860
      edition after they had been sold at auction by George A. Leavitt &amp; Co.
      for $200 "to a Mr Williams" (see the letter from Whitman to John Burroughs
      of ). After the plates came
      into Worthington's hands, he wrote to the poet on : "As the edition is not complete although
      subject as I understand to a copyright of ten per cent it seems to me that
      it would be better for all parties to have it completed. If this idea meets
      your views on the subject I would be willing to make you an immediate
      payment of $250.00 on account and will do everything in my power to make the
      book sell." Despite Whitman's rejection of Worthington's offer, the
      publisher began to run off copies from the plates.<br><br>
      On August 20, 1880, Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke informed Eldridge that he had
      lately discovered many copies of the 1860 edition (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston:
      Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931], 197–198). Probably at Bucke's suggestion
      Whitman wrote on the following day to inquire whether Worthington still
      owned the plates (see the letter from Whitman to Worthington of ). He probably wrote to the same
      effect on September 19 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). After Whitman was offered a copy of the pirated
      book in Philadelphia on November 20, 1880, he decided to take action against
      Worthington.<br><br>
      Early in December Scovel went to New York and compelled Worthington to pay a
      royalty of $50. On December 6 Whitman sent a receipt to the publisher:
      "Rec'd from R Worthington (thro Jas M Scovel) Fifty-Dollars on account of
      royalty in selling(?) my book <em>Leaves of Grass</em> W.
      Whitman" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). It would appear, despite the poet's
      later observations, that the settlement permitted Worthington to continue
      his sales (perhaps only of bound copies) so long as he paid a royalty. On
       Scovel asked to be reimbursed:
      "I expended $9.50 in pursuit of the <em>recalcitrant,
         pirate</em> Worthington, in New York City." Whitman paid Scovel $10
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<br><br>
      On , Whitman informed Osgood &amp;
      Co. that Worthington had "sold languid surreptitious copies—can be
      stopt instantly by me &amp; will be." On August 11, 1881, Whitman "call'd on
      R Worthington . . . &amp; had an interview of over half an hour—I told
      him emphatically he must not print and publish another copy of L. of G. from
      the '60-'61 plates—if so it would be at his peril—he offered $50
      down if I would warrant his printing a new edition of 500 from said plates,
      which I peremptorily declined—Mr Williams &amp; one or two clerks in
      the store heard the conversation—R. W. paid me $25 due me on back
      sales—I shall not trouble him for any thing past—but shall hold
      him to strict account for what is done after this date" (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book).<br><br>
      Apparently Whitman again must have consented to Worthington's selling bound
      copies, for on , the publisher
      wrote to the poet: "I Enclose you check for 44.50 being Copyright on Leaves
      of Grass sold since you last received check." In 1888 Whitman recalled only
      the first payment and "another twenty-five dollars paid at another
      time—I don't know when. I acknowledged both, on account, as royalty"
      (Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, 1:250).<br><br>
      During the 1880s Worthington ran off additional copies. In 1885 Whitman,
      again disturbed about the publisher's activities, wrote about the piracy in
      a lost letter to Eldridge, who advised him on August 17 to write to a firm
      in New York which made "a specialty of copyright cases" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection). Evidently Whitman did not write to the firm, but again availed
      himself of the services of Scovel. About November 5 he noted "from R
      Worthington $24: through J M S" (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<br><br>
      David McKay, the Philadelphia publisher of Whitman's writings, became
      concerned about the plates. On February 12, 1886, Whitman noted "a visit
      from D McKay, ab't the Worthington plates—subscription to purchase"
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<br><br>
      In a letter to the editor of <em>The Critic</em> on June 2,
      1888, William Sloane Kennedy, without mentioning Worthington's name,
      asserted: "Mr. Whitman has not received a cent of copyright on them. . . . I
      hope that this note may be the means of inducing some rich friend of
      Whitman's to put a lawyer on the case, and bring the New Yorkers who are
      issuing the spurious books to justice." Interestingly, Whitman neglected to
      inform Kennedy of the royalties ($143.50) he had accepted (Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, 1:250). It is also
      noteworthy that, despite Kennedy's remarks, Whitman refused to stop the
      publisher: "I am averse to going to law about it: going to law is like going
      to hell: it's too much trouble even if we win" (Traubel, 1:195 and 251). But
      he was willing to go to law at someone else's expense.<br><br>
      Worthington continued to use the plates until they were purchased by the
      literary executors after Whitman's death (<em>The Complete
         Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902],
      8:280).<a href="#r1">[back]
