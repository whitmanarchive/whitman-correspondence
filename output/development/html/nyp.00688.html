   <p>Was very glad to get y'r letter—(I return herewith the <em>Nation</em> criticism)—I have rec'd another letter<sup><a href="#nyp.00688_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> from Tennyson<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Rec'd
      to-day a letter from John Burroughs.<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r4">4</a></sup> He is rather blue—the boy Julian<sup><a href="#loc.01151_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> is his
      great comfort—the "domestic skies" (as he terms it) are not fair and
      happy<sup><a href="#nyp.00688_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup>—I hear from Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r7">7</a></sup>—Rhys<sup><a href="#n4152" id="r8">8</a></sup> is there with him &amp; they take to each
      other muchly—I am invited (by letter from Cortland Palmer,<sup><a href="#n4159" id="r9">9</a></sup> rec'd to day) to go
      to R's lect: before the Century Club, NY Feb 7, &amp; say a word at
      conclusion—But of course cannot go—I have rec'd a nice letter from
      Whittier,<sup><a href="#n1029" id="r10">10</a></sup> thanking me, &amp;c.<sup><a href="#nyp.00688_n4" id="r11">11</a></sup> I hear from Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r12">12</a></sup> regularly &amp; often—he
      is true as steel—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Has been very bleak &amp; cold here but better &amp; sunny to
      day—I am quite unwell, but keep up &amp; around &amp; eat my meals in
      moderation—(an old fellow who comes here said to me as I was eating my supper
      "No extremes any way—but eternal vigilance in eating &amp; drinking is the
      only thing for a sick man or an old coon.")
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I want to print a little 15 or 20 page <em>Annex</em> to L of

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00688_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Ans'd Jan. 27/88." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service |
      Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | Jan (?) | 8 PM | 88;
      Washington, Rec.d | Jan 15 | 7 AM | 1888.<a href="#r1">[back]

      Alfred, Lord Tennyson to Whitman of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0625">3. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">4. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="loc.01151_n1">5. Julian Burroughs
      (1878–1954), the only son of John and Ursula Burroughs, later became a
      landscape painter, writer, and photographer.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00688_n3">6. On , Burroughs wrote: "My domestic
      skies are not pleasant &amp; I seem depressed &amp; restless most of the time. .
      . . I dislike the winters more &amp; more &amp; shall not try to spend another
      in this solitude. Indeed I am thinking strongly of selling my place. I am sick
      of the whole business of housekeeping. If it was not for Julian I should not
      hesitate a moment. J. goes to school &amp; is a bright happy boy, very eager for
      knowledge, &amp; with a quick intelligence. He alone makes life tolerable to
      me."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">7. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4152">8. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4159">9. Courtland Palmer was the founder
      and first president of the Nineteenth Century Club, a group dedicated to
      discussing significant social and philosophical issues of the time.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1029">10. John Greenleaf Whittier
      (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
      slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
      surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
      Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
      volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (various publishers: 1906–1996) and Whitman's "My Tribute to Four Poets,"
      in <em>Specimen Days</em> (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh &amp; Co.,
      1882–'83), 180–181.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00688_n4">11. In a brief note on , Whittier wrote: "But for illness
      I should have thanked thee before this for thy vigorous lines of greeting in
      Munyon's Illustrated World, combining as they do the cradle and evening song of
      my life. My brother writers have been very generous to me and I heartily thank
      them for it" (see also Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.3.html">Tuesday, July 17, 1888</a>).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">12. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4183">13. Whitman published his first "annex"
      to <em>Leaves of Grass</em>—"Sands at Seventy"—in the
      1889 issue of his book. All but one of the poems appeared earlier in <em>November Boughs </em>(1888).<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07527_n5">14. Elias Hicks
      (1748–1830) was a traveling Quaker preacher and anti-slavery activist from
      Long Island, New York. Whitman's long essay on Hicks appeared in <em>November Boughs</em>. For more on Hicks, see Henry Watson
      Wilbur, <em>The Life and Labors of Elias Hicks</em> (Philadelphia:
      Friends' General Conference Advancement Committee, 1910).<a href="#r14">[back]
