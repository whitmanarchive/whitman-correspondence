      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>At last I am beginning to receive from the bindery the second batch of my late Two
      Volume edition (I print 600 copies each Vol.) &amp; send you a set in the new
      binding, by this mail. I am now at last also supplying my English subscribers &amp;
      friends their Vols.—have sent their books, postpaid, by same mail with this to
      several of them (see list appended)<sup><a href="#loc.02838_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—&amp; the rest will follow, until every one will be
      sent—probably within the next ten days. I sent <em>you</em> the
      Vol. for Mrs. Matthews,<sup><a href="#loc.02838_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> as the address was too indefinite—How about G. W.
      Foote<sup><a href="#loc.02838_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> and J. T. Nettleship mention'd by you &amp; giving
      extracts, under date of May 23d?<sup><a href="#loc.02838_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> Their
      names do not appear in the lists you have given me to send books to. The <em>Athenaeum</em> folks have sent me good pay for the little
      poem,<sup><a href="#loc.02838_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      but I have had nothing, &amp; heard nothing from the <em>Examiner</em>. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I expected to have heard of Mrs. Gilchrist's arrival in The U.S.<sup><a href="#loc.02838_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; to have had perhaps
      ere this the great happiness of meeting her—but have heard nothing up to
      date. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My letter of June 26, speaking of the situation, the delay in printing this second
      batch, &amp;c.—And my letter of July 3d acknowledging yours of June 20,
      enclosing one £45-9-6, &amp; list—you have. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I enclose herewith a later circular—will send you a dozen or so soon. </p>
   
   
   <p>My dear little baby-nephew, &amp; namesake, is dead, &amp; buried by the side of my
      mother, a bitter cup to me—Otherwise things are about the same with me as
      before—&amp; I am jogging along about the same.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02838_n1">1. The list is not with this
      draft letter, but see Whitman's 
      letter to William Michael Rossetti.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02838_n2">2. Whitman sent the book with
      his  letter to Rossetti.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02838_n3">3. George William Foote
      (1850–1915), a freethinker, was the author of many pamphlets attacking
      Christianity. Foote did not forward £3 to Walt Whitman. Rossetti mentioned on
      , that he had called the
      failure to pay to Foote's attention. Whitman received a letter from Foote in
      , who promised to send
      the sum, which he alleged had been stolen by an employee. After the entry the
      poet later wrote "<em>fraud</em>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02838_n4">4. For Nettleship, see
      Whitman's  letter to Edward
      Dowden. Rossetti's letter of May 23 is not known.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02838_n5">5. £3.3 (see Whitman's  letter to Rossetti).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02838_n6">6. Gilchrist and her
      children arrived in Philadelphia on September 10, 1876 (Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Though Gilchrist had come to America to
      accomplish in person what she had not been able to accomplish in her
      letters—to become Mrs. Whitman—she was practical enough to arm
      herself with letters of introduction to various Americans. Rossetti, her shrewd
      and somewhat snobbish advisor, wrote on August 23 and 24, 1876, to various
      painters and to Charles Eliot Norton (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r6">[back]
