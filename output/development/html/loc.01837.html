      <br></br><br></br>Mr. Walt Whitman—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I this day saw in the paper "Hearth and Home" of New York a short editorial stating
      that Congress had caused the discharge from public service of many persons who were
      brought into distress thereby, and your name was mentioned as one of the number. This
      last concerns me seriously and causes me to [
      <span class="unclear">write?</span>]
       to a complete stranger.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish first to amuse you a little, then to acquaint myself with your real situation,
      and lastly to see if I can be of service to you if you are really in distress.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A Narrative—About five years ago I read in the Louisville (K.Y.) Courier-Journal a
      notice of the death of Walt Whitman a Poet. Of that notice I remembered only a few
      words. Afterwards occasionally saw humorous poems or would-be poems about current
      events "in the style of Walt Whitman". About that time I also, obeying an "impulse"
      or "law of my being" which was <u>effectual</u> if not "irresistible" <u>went for a Poet</u> for my county. Yes, Bret Harte, Joaquin Miller, and myself blazed forth on a world
      [
      <span class="unclear">for?</span>]
       a county in the same otherwise eventful year 1870. Last winter I [
      <span class="unclear">saw?</span>]
       a short item in a paper making me suspect that <u>Walt</u> might still be in "a state of probation". Again this summer learned in my backwoods
      hermit home that Walt's Poems were in books, and that "English critics consider him
      the greatest Poet of America." Accordingly I sent some money to a New York Bookseller
      and got "Leaves of Grass" and 
      
      
      
      "As a strong bird on pinions free".
   </p>
   
   <p>[
      <span class="unclear">Here?</span>]
       comes in the fun. I had expected something strange, but the work was so very different
      from anything else I had met with it was for a short hour or so utterly incomprehensible.
      In my disappointment and vexation I then said to my family "the Publisher who [
      <span class="unclear">would?</span>]
       publish and the Bookseller who [
      <span class="unclear">sells?</span>]
       such a book ought to be <u>hung for swindling</u>.  In a little time with the help of the Preface in the small volume and the Publishers
      notes at the end of the same I got a hint or clue to the understanding of your work.
      I think myself exceedingly good tho' at solving literary puzzles and would probably
      have soon divined the mystery from the work alone. I assure you I was soon "cavorting"
      round and asserting that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)
   </p>
   
   <p>[
      <span class="unclear">I?</span>]
       think your works are not known here. And thou great man! I wish to inquire can it
      be that your books are not sold [
      <span class="unclear">in?</span>]
       such number as to support you without help of or employment of the U.S. Government.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been aiming to send for Burroughs' Notes—W. W. as Poet and Person [
      <span class="unclear">but?</span>]
       have not yet done so.)
   </p>
   
   <p>Finally, <u>for brevity</u>, I will ask you to <u>write</u> to [
      <span class="unclear">as as?</span>]
       <u>strange</u> a man as <u>you can be</u>, and believe me I think I can do you some service if you need.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.
