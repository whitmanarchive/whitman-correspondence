   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter was received, enclosing one from Mary Wigglesworth with $30 from herself
      &amp; her sisters Jane &amp; Anne—As I happened stopping at one of the hospitals last night
      Miss Lowe just from Boston came to me &amp; handed the letters—My friend, you must convey
      the blessings of the poor young men around me here, many amid deepest afflictions
      not of body only but of soul, to your friends Mary, Jane, &amp; Anne Wigglesworth.<sup><a href="#loc.00796_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> Their &amp; all contributions shall be sacredly used among them. I find more &amp; more how
      a little money rightly directed, the exact thing at the exact moment, goes a great
      ways, to make gifts comfort &amp; truly nourish these American soldiers, so full of manly independence,
      is required the spirit of love &amp; boundless brotherly tenderness, hand in hand with
      greatest tact. I do not find any lack in the storehouses, nor eager willingness of
      the North to unlock them for the soldiers—but sadly everywhere a lack of fittest hands
      to apply, &amp; of just the right thing in just the right measure, &amp; of all being vivified
      by the spirit I have mentioned—
   </p>
   
   <p>Say to the sisters Mary &amp; Jane &amp; Anne Wigglesworth, &amp; to your own sister, Margaret,<sup><a href="#loc.00796_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> that as I feel it a privilege myself to be doing a part among these things, I know
      well enough the like privilege must be sweet to them, to their compassionate &amp; sisterly souls, &amp; need indeed few thanks, &amp; only ask its being
      put to best use, what they feel to give among sick &amp; wounded. I have received L B
      Russell's<sup><a href="#loc.00796_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> letter &amp; contribution by same hand, &amp; shall try to write to him to-morrow—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Hannah E. Stevenson was
      the sister of Margaret S. Curtis, wife of Boston counselor Charles Curtis. Both
      women sent sums of money to Whitman for his work in the army hospitals.
      Stevenson heard of Whitman's hospital work from Dr. Le Baron Russell, and she
      wrote to Whitman on 
      .
      She had been, Dr. Russell wrote to Whitman on , "an ardent worker in one of the Georgetown
      Hospitals".
      She was also associated with William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips in the
      abolitionist movement and was a patron of the Home for Aged Colored Women in
      Boston. She died in 1887; see the <em>Boston Evening
         Transcript</em>, June 11, 1887. On presenting a rough draft of this October
      8, 1863, letter to Horace Traubel, Whitman exclaimed: "That was a great woman"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York:
      Rowman and Littlefield, 1961], 1:26).
