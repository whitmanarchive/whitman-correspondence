   <p>I wrote to you three [or] four days ago,<sup><a href="#tex.00346_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> by which you must have

       partial list. The list on the other sheet will more fully show you what books I
      have sent, <em>comprising I believe all the names &amp; remitting subscribers
         you have sent me</em>—Your two (principal) remittances £28.4 (April 19) and £45.9.6.
      (June 20) were accompanied with lists of subscribers' 
      am'ts
      
       &amp; addresses—the names on which lists &amp; addresses I have carefully
      followed &amp; sent to. I hope &amp; think I have not missed any. <em>If you
         discover or know of any so missed, pray notify me at once</em>. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Looking over the pretty voluminous correspondence &amp; extracts you have sent me so
      kindly, the last six months, there appear to be <em>a number of other
         names</em>, both men's &amp; women's, mentioned, or writing themselves, as ordering the
      books in letters to you. But of course <em>I have exclusively confined myself
         to the names &amp; addresses specified in the lists accompanying your
         remittance–letters</em>, above alluded to. I have been somewhat exercised about
      those <em>other names</em>. <br><br>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0522">1. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

      Dublin.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00346_n3">4. Probably Edward Armstrong (1846–

         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00346_n4">5. Perhaps A. C. de Burgh, to whom Walt
      Whitman sent two volumes on September 7, 1876, in care of T. W. H. Rolleston in
      Dublin; the entry, however, was later deleted (Commonplace Book, Charles E.

   <p id="tex.00346_n7">8. Probably Edward Dowden's clergyman

   <p id="tex.00346_n8">9. Walt Whitman sent the 1876 set to Lady
      Hardy in London on October 24, 1876 (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). She was probably the wife of Herbert Hardy, first Baron
      Cozens-Hardy (1838–1920), an English judge.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00346_n9">10. Walt Whitman sent two volumes to C. W.
      Sheppard at Horsham, England, on September 6, 1876 (Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00346_n10">11. Dowden characterized Dr. John Todhunter
      (1839–1916) as "a man of science, &amp; a mystic—a Quaker."
      Todhunter later held a chair in English literature at Alexandria College in
      Dublin, and wrote <em>Study of Shelley</em> (1880), in which he
      termed Shelley, Hugo, and Walt Whitman the three poets of democracy. See Harold
      Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in England</em> (Ithaca: Cornell
      University Press, 1934), 180.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0521">12. Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882), brother of
      Christina and William Michael Rossetti, was an English poet, translator, and
      painter. His highly stylized portraits of women influenced the development of
      the Symbolist movement in Europe. His brother William Michael Rossetti was one
      of Whitman's most influential European editors and supporters.<a href="#r12">[back]

   <p id="tex.00346_n11">13. See also Whitman's  to William Michael Rossetti. Walt
      Whitman sent two books to John Trivett Nettleship on October 24, 1876

      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r13">[back]

      at Clifton College, Bristol, on October 24, 1876 (Commonplace Book, Charles E.

      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00346_n13">15. Sir Hubert von Herkomer
      (1849–1914), a Bavarian painter who resided in England and was professor
      of Fine Arts at Oxford from 1885 to 1894. He was correctly cited as "Hubert" in
      the draft of this letter as well as in Whitman's Commonplace Book, in which
      Whitman noted forwarding two volumes on October 24, 1876 (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r15">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00346_n14">16. A poet and the author of a critical
      notice of Walt Whitman in <em>Dark Blue</em> in 1871 (see
      Whitman's  letter to Rossetti).
      Noel was hurt because Richard Maurice Bucke did not include the essay in his
      biography; see Noel's letters to Walt Whitman of  and .<a href="#r16">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0610">17. Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) was a
      British poet, critic, playwright, and novelist. He was also one of Whitman's
      earliest English admirers. At the conclusion of <em>William Blake:
         A Critical Essay</em> (1868), 300–303, Swinburne pointed out
      similarities between Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly
      Rocking" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the
      most sweet and sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world." His
      famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America" is included in <em>Songs
         before Sunrise</em> (1871). For the story of Swinburne's veneration of
      Whitman and his later recantation, see two essays by Terry L. Meyers, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00740.pdf">Swinburne and Whitman: Further Evidence</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="tex.00346_n15">18. George William Foote (1850–1915), a
      freethinker, was the author of many pamphlets attacking Christianity. Foote did
      not forward £3 to Walt Whitman. Rossetti mentioned on , that he had called the failure to pay to Foote's
      attention. On February 12, 1878, Whitman cited a letter from Foote, who promised
      to send the sum, which he alleged had been stolen by an employee (Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). After the entry the
      poet later wrote "<em>fraud</em>."<a href="#r18">[back]

   <p id="n0199">21. Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>).
