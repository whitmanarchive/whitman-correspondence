   <p>I was very glad to hear that you had been so well this summer<sup><a href="#n1027" id="r1">1</a></sup>—so comparatively well. Paralysis, even partial, must be a terrible enemy to fight
      against. I should think it would put a man's faith in the sources of spiritual joy
      to a very severe test. Yet I have sometimes felt as if I wished that some such calamity
      would overtake me—it seems so easy to be free and happy when one has perfect health
      and strength—and how can one say to a suffering friend: 'Be strong,' without seeming
      to speak impertinently? But for myself I do not feel that I could be overwhelmed by
      any misfortune that left my mind untouched. Insanity however is sometimes a terrible
      problem to me. To think that
   </p> 
   <span class="indent">"However we have writ the style of Gods</span><br><span class="indent">And made a push at chance and sufferance,"<sup><a href="#loc.03539_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></span><br> 
   <p>our impregnable fortress, the mind, can be attacked at its very centre: that accident,
      heredity, a little meddling with the cortex of the brain, can 
      
      
      
      reduce the proudest stoic that ever lived to a helpless, soulless idiot—! there is
      a cynical irony in it, as if man seeking to assert himself in the universe, saying
      "Here at least, in the spirit, I have freedom and empire inalienable," were to find
      that there most of all he is enslaved—the sport of the blind forces of materialism.
      Yet sometimes when I seem to see that there <em>is</em> no such thing as "materialism," your passage about the insane in 'Faces' seems sun-clear
      to me—one must live in the faith of one's hours of brightest insight.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am sending you herewith a translation of the Encheiridion of Epictetus which I have
      been working at for some time.<sup><a href="#loc.05122_n7" id="r3">3</a></sup> I came across the book this last summer, and it laid hold of my mind so that I could
      not put it away till I had finished as good a translation as I can make of it. I have
      had a dozen copies printed here as I want to ask the opinion of one or two friends
      about publishing it as a little book, a 
      
      
      
      "handbook" as the Greek name describes it. Read with sympathy and understanding I
      think it is very valuable—at least it has given me some solid nutriment, and might
      to others. The copies only came home this day. I had for some time intended to write
      to you when that should happen.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I saw in the 'Academy' a paragraph saying that you were going to write something about
      the English poets of the XIX Century in one of the London magazines. I shall look
      out with great interest for that. I hope you mean English-<u>writing</u> poets for I should greatly like to hear some of your definite ideas about the Americans.
      To say the truth, I never could quite accept your utter condemnation of all American
      authors, expressed both in prose &amp; poetry. I certainly see that tried by a right Democratic
      standard they fail. Longfellow, Whittier, &amp;c. are just as much poets of Europe as
      poets of America, if not more. But then you do not condemn the non-Democratic European
      poets in that wholesale manner—for so far forth as they are poets, so far forth as
      they help to put ideas of beauty, nobleness, love, into our minds they help mankind,
      Democracy even included. And 
      
      
      
      do not the Americans do this also, to a certain extent? I am not by any means a worshipper
      of Emerson, but can it really be said of him that he "expresses nothing characteristic,
      suffices only the lowest level of vacant minds."<sup><a href="#loc.03539_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> And Thoreau, surely he is something, very much. Shall we not thank these men for
      what they are? (though emphatically demanding something more).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Do you ever hear of what passes in Ireland? Things are at a lamentable pass there
      now, and the House of Lords stands like a block in the way of deliverance. I venture
      to say their late action has made England take a great stride in the direction of
      Republicanism. Indeed I sometimes think that time is very close now; people are beginning
      at last to find out that our 'constitutional sovereigns' are a little ridiculous,
      &amp; that £500000 is rather a large annuity to pay a monarch for having the goodness
      to do nothing! If the scattered Republicans in England could unite their forces and
      (say) found a paper in which politics, literature &amp;c would all be treated from the
      highest Republican standpoint, it might do much. I have the idea at some time of trying
      to found some such thing. But at 23 years one has not experience enough for carrying
      out such schemes! Besides, I don't know whether I won't 
      
      
      
      give up any idea of a literary life entirely, &amp; take to farming in the backwoods.
      Anyway, I shall be here for 6 months longer, and I will not forbear to say how much
      I should like now &amp; then to write to you, &amp; sometimes to hear of you.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1027">1. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.

         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
