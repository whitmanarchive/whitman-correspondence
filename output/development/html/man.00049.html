      <br></br>Bryanston,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">July 9th 1880
      
      <br></br><br></br>To Walt Whitman Esq.
      <br></br>Respected and Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You will doubtless be surprised at the receipt of this letter. I will briefly state
      the causes which lead me to write it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A fortnight ago to-day, I was visiting the Brigade Camp of volunteers, then
      stationed at London East. I there recognized you, Mr
      Whitman as the original of a portrait published several years ago, in an issue of
      Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper.
   </p>
   
   <p>You may possibly recollect me as the young person with whom you exchanged a few words
      on that day, respecting 
      the Huron 
      Co. Battalion and particularly about that portion of [
      <span class="unclear">their?</span>]
       head-gear named
      'Havelocks'.
      Subsequently I had the honor of receiving a recognition from you, and believe me,
      the compliment, though perhaps undeserved, was duly appreciated and treasured as a
      happy recollection.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Not content with this however, I have resolved, not without misgivings as to its propriety,
      to write
      to you, respectfully requesting by way of answer, a few words of advice, suitable
      to
      a young person (myselfâ€”22 yrs old to-day) desirous of embracing Literature as a
      profession. Report relates many incidents to show the desire you express of aiding,
      by the help of your genius, many with whom you come in contact and I am all the more
      willing to believe these reports, when I read in your poetry the lessons that teach
      the sublimity of Friendship the pathos of human sympathy, and the power that one man
      may wield over the destinies of another.
   </p>
   
   <p>Earnestly hoping that you will honor my desire,</p>

      I remain very faithfully yours,
