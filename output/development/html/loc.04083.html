      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I receive a postal from you this date address to me at New Britain 
      Conn.<sup><a href="#n0514" id="r1">1</a></sup> I am well
      and so is my Family. My health is better than it has been in some time &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       I have a
      little place here and are 
      triing
      
       hard to get along. I am raising 
      vedgeables
      
       for the New York market &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       it is the busy season here now &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       I was glad to hear
      from you and that you are better &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       I have thought of you a good many times &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       I should
      like to see you and if God 
      spairs
      
       our lives I hope to see you once more but God know what is best, if we but
      look to him he will take care of us and make our griefs and pains easy to bear &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       I
      have often thought of what you have had to go through and suffer in your sickness.
      I
      wish that you 
      whare
      
       that I could see you and comfort you. I have got a 
      find
      
       little boy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       I have named him after you he is now 
      most
      
       four years old will be in June next. I should be happy to hear from you as
      soon as you get this
