      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I write you a few lines to let you know that I have come home on a month's furlough—there
      is nothing very new or special with me. I am still employed in the Attorney Gen'l's
      office, &amp; shall return there before the middle of next month. I often think about
      you, &amp; wish it was so we could have each others society frequently—Byron, I don't
      know certain whether I have written to you since I rec'd your last letter or not—but
      it came safe, &amp; was glad to hear from you—write soon, my dear comrade, &amp; direct your
      letter to me, Portland Av. near Myrtle, Brooklyn, New York.<sup><a href="#med.00313_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> Soon as I get back to Washington, I will send you word.
   </p>
   
   <p>Here in this place &amp; New York, I go around quite a good deal—it is a great excitement
      to go around the busiest parts of New York, Broadway, &amp; the wharves, &amp; great ferries—The
      oceans of people, the trucks &amp; omnibuses, go all jammed together, &amp; such bustle &amp;
      noise—I like it much for a few hours now and then—but don't want to be continually
      in it—I have made an addition to the little book "Drum Taps,"<sup><a href="#med.00313_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; will send you one of the perfect copies soon—we had a fine long pouring rain here
      all last night—I am writing this home at my mother's, in the front basement sitting
      by the stove, as the weather is cool—Mother is absent at Burlington, Vt, but returns
      to-morrow—the others have gone to church, etc—so I am entirely alone to-day—so I thought
      I couldn't do better than write to you. Dear comrade, I hope you are well &amp; doing
      well—write soon, boy—from your loving friend and comrade—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Whitman corresponded with
      Byron Sutherland, a soldier, between 1865 and 1870. On September 20, 1868, he
      wrote to Sutherland: "I retain just the same friendship I formed for you the
      short time we were together, (but intimate,) in 1865" (Henry W. and Albert A.
      Berg Collection, New York Public Library; Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:44–45).
