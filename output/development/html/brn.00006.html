   </p>
   
   
   <p>During my wanderings in the tropics, with my nervous system feeling like a mixed-up
      mess of broken fiddle-strings, I've often thought of you—&amp; wondered if all poets have
      got &amp; pay such tribute to mortality. I am not given to autograph-collecting, but
      
      
      
      
      Linton has sent me a proof-copy of his admirable  engraving of your head-and-shoulders, &amp; I would very much like to have some of your
      Ms. to place beside it. Haven't you got some scrap of paper, which you can spare, containing
      a few lines of your own work? And, if so, won't you give it me? I am one of those
      American writers who have always looked upon you as a noble, original, &amp; characteristic
      poet; &amp;
      
      
      
      perhaps, in your retirement, it may not seem ungracious or officious, for me to tell
      you so. When I was a boy I read extracts from your first book, in a "Putnam's Mag."
      review—the "little Captain" &amp; the "crushed fireman". They greatly influenced me, &amp;
      I have read all you have written since.
   </p>
   
   <p>Swinburne, in his letters to me, always speaks carefully &amp; understandingly of you.</p>
   
   <p>I hope that you truly
      
      
      
      will be soon as healthy as your disposition always was &amp; is, &amp; wish that every part
      of myself was as healthy as either.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
