   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00636_n6">1. This letter dates to
      December 28, 1868. "December 28" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and
      Richard Maurice Bucke added the date notation "1868 (?)" on the first page.
      Edwin Haviland Miller cited Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–1977],
      2:366). The year 1868 is corroborated by Louisa's reference to a tragic fire in
      Richmond: a housekeeper and at least five men died ("The Richmond Calamity," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, December 28, 1868, 3).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00636_n9">2. Walt Whitman's late December
      21–25?, 1868 letter ("last week") is not extant.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00636_n14">3. The "big book" that Walt
      Whitman sent his mother is not known, but it may have been another almanac.
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote in her  letter to Walt that he had sent her two almanacs the previous
      year, and she acknowledged the receipt of a "franklyn almanack" in her  letter.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00636_n8">4. The "young woman" has not
      been identified.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00636_n30">5. Walt Whitman's late
      December 26?, 1868 letter is not extant. It is possible that this letter from
      Walt is the same as the one mentioned above, but Louisa Van Velsor Whitman later
      refers to "all letters." Therefore, Walt probably sent two letters to his mother
      between December 21 and December 26, 1868.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00636_n7">6. The <em>Brooklyn Directory</em> (1868) lists a Cephas Gill at 188 Myrtle Avenue as
      a dealer in stoves. The stove is a coal-burning stove for heating, and Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman had purchased a supply of coal the previous month (see her
       letter to Walt
      Whitman).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00636_n11">7. The back room was in the
      new larger house at 1149 Atlantic Avenue, which was probably the occasion also
      for the need to purchase the coal-burning stove (see previous note). Walt
      Whitman had assisted his mother during the move (see Walt Whitman's  letter to Peter Doyle).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">8. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00636_n12">9. The "ond" is omitted in
      "richmond" at the paper's edge to shorten the word.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00636_n4">10. The <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> printed a graphic letter from a man to his wife,
      which detailed his experience on the night of December 24 during a fire at the
      Spotswood Hotel in Richmond, Virginia. The fire claimed the lives of a
      housekeeper and at least five men ("The Richmond Calamity," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, December 28, 1868, 3).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00636_n5">11. The "ur" is omitted in
      "your" to shorten the word at the paper's edge.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n5">12. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
      later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
      Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
      pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
      correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
      poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r12">[back]
