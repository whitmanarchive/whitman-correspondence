      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter, &amp; the two accompanying, came safe. I saw F. P. Church again
      yesterday—the arrangement is, that <em>Democracy</em> is to make
      an article of fifteen or sixteen pages, &amp; is [to] be the leading article of the
      December number—it must be in his hands by the 25th of October. The <em>Ethiopia Commenting</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00268_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> has been formally
      accepted, but is held back until the long article appears. I have felt that the <em>Galaxy</em> folks have received &amp; treated me with welcome
      warmth &amp; respect. F. P. Church is a sample of a New Yorker, a club man, (he
      pressingly invited me to a dinner at Atheneum Club—I declined,) young,
      cordial, refined, &amp;c. He made no very decided impression on me, however—we
      will see how the acquaintance works &amp; holds out in the future. The indirect
      &amp; inferential of his tone &amp; words in speaking to me would have satisfied
      your highest requirements—they evidently meant that in his opinion I was, or
      was soon to be, "one of the great powers."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing new among my folks, or domestic matters. I have been purchasing property,
      or
      rather becoming responsible for the same<sup><a href="#nyp.00268_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>William, you needn't send any more of my letters to me here, after you receive
      this—keep them for me. I shall return within three or four days—I shall
      write out &amp; finish <em>Democracy</em> there, as my leave extends
      two weeks yet. I suppose you rec'd the <em>Gazette</em>, containing T.
      Titcomb,<sup><a href="#nyp.00268_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> his opinion on such books as <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>, etc.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think it very likely I shall return on Monday 30th. I have seen Fred. Gray,
      Nathaniel Bloom<sup><a href="#nyp.00268_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup>—the dear, good, affectionate young men—more kind, more
      affectionate than ever.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>William, I do hope, it will come to you to buckle-to, &amp; write something for
      Putnam—<em>et al</em>. You are talked about, &amp; cause
      expectancies, curiosities, &amp;c.—F. P. Church sent a florid &amp; evidently
      genuine message to you by me—the meat of it is, a fervid appreciation of your
      literary genius, &amp; a special request that you write for the <em>Galaxy</em>.<sup><a href="#nyp.00268_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup> John Burroughs, I
      send you my love, &amp; will soon be with you all again—
   </p>
