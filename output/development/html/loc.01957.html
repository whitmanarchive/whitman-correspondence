      <br></br><br></br>My beloved Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had read [
      <span class="unclear">thy?</span>]
       sublime poem [
      <span class="unclear">of?</span>]
       the "Universal" once and again, and yet again—seeing it in the Graphic, Post, Mail,
      World, and among other papers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      It <u>is</u> sublime.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      It raised my mind to its own sublimity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      It seems to me the sublimest of all your poems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I cannot help reading it every once of a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I return to it as a fountain of joy
   </p>
   
   <p>My beloved Walt.—You know how I have worshipped you, without change or cessation,
      for twenty years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      While my [
      <span class="unclear">soul?</span>]
       Exists, the worship must be Ever new.
   </p>
   
   <p>It was perhaps the very day of the publication of the first edition the "Leaves of
      Grass" [
      <span class="unclear">that I?</span>]
       saw a copy of it at at a newspaper stand in [
      <span class="unclear">Fulton?</span>]
       street Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it with wonder, and [
      <span class="unclear"> felt that there?</span>]
       was something that touched on depths of my humanity. Since then you have grown before
      me, grown around me, and grown into me.
   </p>
   
   <p>—I expected certainly to go down to Camden last fall to see you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      But something prevented. And, in time, I saw in [
      <span class="unclear">the poems that just hard reward?</span>]
      .
   </p>
   
   <p>—[
      <span class="unclear">In New Year?</span>]
       took me with a new friend of action among the miserables.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Oh, what scenes of human horror were to be found in this city [
      <span class="unclear">last winter?</span>]
      .
   </p>
   
   <p>—I cannot tell you how much I was engaged, or all I did for [
      <span class="unclear">twelve months?</span>]
      .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I [
      <span class="unclear">must?</span>]
       wait till I see you to tell you about these story'sstory's.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       I have
      
      
      
      been going toward social radicalism of later years, and appeared more of the [
      <span class="unclear">Academy?</span>]
       of [illegible] lately on [
      <span class="unclear">Primort?</span>]
       and oratoring the [illegible] meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      How I would like to see you, in order to temper my [
      <span class="unclear">heat?</span>]
      , and expand my [
      <span class="unclear">narrowness?</span>]
      
   </p>
   
   <p>How absurd it is to suppose that there is [
      <span class="unclear">any interest?</span>]
       in the brain of a man who can generate the poems of The "Universal"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I would [illegible] and [
      <span class="unclear">say?</span>]
       that [
      <span class="unclear">same?</span>]
       kind of ailment [
      <span class="unclear">ought to spread?</span>]
      .
   </p>
   
   <p>My beloved Walt—Tell me if you would like me to come to see you, and heretofor I can
      do so within a few weeks.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Swinton (1829–1901), a journalist and
      friend of Karl Marx, became acquainted with Whitman during the Civil War.
      Swinton, managing editor of the <em>New York Times</em>,
      frequented Pfaff's, where he probably met Whitman. Whitman's correspondence with
      Swinton began on . Swinton's
      enthusiasm for Whitman was unbounded. On , Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly impressed with the great
      humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you. I read this afternoon in
      the book. I read its first division which I never before read. I could convey no
      idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more to me than all other books and
      poetry." On , Swinton wrote what
      the poet termed "almost like a love letter": "It was perhaps the very day of the
      publication of the first edition of the 'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of
      it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street, Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it
      with wonder, and felt that here was something that touched on depths of my
      humanity. Since then you have grown before me, grown around me, and grown into
      me" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.13.html">Tuesday, April 10, 1888</a>). He praised Whitman in the <em>New York Herald</em> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke,
      <em>Walt Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
      36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
      for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <em>New York Sun</em>, and for the next four years edited the
      weekly labor journal, <em>John Swinton's Paper</em>. When this
      publication folded, he returned to the <em>Sun</em>. See Robert
      Waters, <em>Career and Conversations of John Swinton</em>
      (Chicago: C.H. Kerr, 1902), and Meyer Berger, <em>The History of
         The New York Times, 1851–1951</em> (New York: Simon and Schuster,
      1951), 250–251. See also Donald Yannella, "Swinton, John
