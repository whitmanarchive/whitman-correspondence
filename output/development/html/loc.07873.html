   <p>Y'r letter welcomed<sup><a href="#loc.07873_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Feel pretty fair
      (considering)—was out in wheel chair, but cold—sit here today in big
      chair with old wolf-skin spread on back—some visitors—write &amp; read
      (or rather go thro' the motions)—once in a while something or somebody that
      <em>cheers me</em>—(what an art that is!)—Often think
      of you all there—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
