      <br></br><br></br>Dear Hugo.<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.00795_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I don't know why I have delayed so long as a month to write to you, for your affectionate
      &amp; lively letter of September 5th gave me as much pleasure as I ever received from
      correspondence—I read it even yet &amp; have taken the liberty to show it to one or two
      persons I knew would be interested. Dear comrade, you must be assured that my heart
      is much with you in New York, &amp; with my other dear friends, your associates—&amp;, my
      dear, I wish you to excuse me to Fred Gray, &amp; to Perk, &amp; Ben Knower, for not yet writing
      to them, also to Charley Kingsley, should you see him—I am contemplating a tremendous
      letter to my dear comrade Frederickus, which will make up for deficiencies—my own
      comrade Fred, how I should like to see him &amp; have a good heart's time with him, &amp;
      a mild orgie, just for a basis, you know, for talk &amp; interchange of reminiscences &amp; the play of
      the quiet lambent electricity of real friendship—O Hugo, as my pen glides along writing
      these thoughts, I feel as if I could not delay coming right off to New York &amp; seeing
      you all, you &amp; Fred &amp; Bloom, &amp; every body—I want to see you, to be within hand's reach
      of you, &amp; hear your voices, even if only for one evening, for only three hours—I want
      to hear Perk's fiddle—I want to hear Perk himself, (&amp; I will humbly submit to drink
      to the Church of England)—I want to be with Bloom, (that wretched young man who I hear continually adorns himself outwardly,
      but I hear nothing of the interior &amp;c)<sup><a href="#loc.00795_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; I want to see Charley Russell, &amp; if [when?] he is in N. Y. you see him I wish you
      to say that I sent him my love, particular, &amp; that he &amp; Fred &amp; Charles Chauncey remain
      a group of itself in the portrait-gallery of my heart &amp; mind yet &amp; forever—for so
      it happened for our dear times, when we first got acquainted, (we recked not of them as they passed,) were so good, so hearty, those friendship-times, our
      talk, our knitting together, it may be a whim, but I think nothing could be better
      or quieter &amp; more happy of the kind—&amp; is there any better kind in life's experiences?
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear comrade, I still live here as a hospital missionary after my own style, &amp; on
      my own hook—I go every day or night without fail to some of the great government hospitals—O
      the sad scenes I witness—scenes of death, anguish, the fevers, amputations, friendlessness,
      of hungering &amp; thirsting young hearts, for some loving presence—such noble young men
      as some of these wounded are—such endurance, such native decorum, such candor—I will
      confess to you, dear Hugo, that in some respects I find myself in my element amid
      these scenes—shall I not say to you that I find I supply often to some of these dear
      suffering boys in my presence &amp; magnetism that which nor doctors nor medicines nor
      skill nor any routine assistance can give?
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Dear Hugo, you must write to me often as you can, &amp; not delay it, your letters are
      very dear to me. Did you see my newspaper letter in N Y Times of Sunday Oct 4? About
      my dear comrade Bloom, is he still out in Pleasant Valley? Does he meet you often?
      Do you &amp; the fellows meet at Gray's or any where? O Hugo, I wish I could hear with
      you the current opera—I saw Devereux<sup><a href="#loc.00795_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> in the N Y papers of Monday announced for that night, &amp; I knew in all probability
      you would be there—tell me how it goes, and about the principal singers—only dont
      run away with that theme, &amp; occupy too much of your letter with it—but tell me mainly
      about all my dear friends, &amp; every little personal item, &amp; what you all do, &amp; say
      &amp;c.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am excellent well. I have cut my beard short, &amp; hair ditto: (all my acquaintances
      are in anger &amp; despair &amp; go about wringing their hands). My face is all tanned &amp; red.
      If the weather is moist or has been lately, or looks as if it thought of going to
      be, I perambulate this land in big army boots outside &amp; up to my knees. Then around
      my majestic brow, around my well-brimmed felt hat—a black &amp; gold cord with acorns.
      Altogether the effect is satisfactory. The guards as I enter or pass places often
      salute me. All of which I tell, as you will of course take pride in your friend's
      special &amp; expanding glory.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Fritschy, I am writing this in Major Hapgood's office, fifth story, by a window that
      overlooks all down the city, &amp; over &amp; down the beautiful Potomac, &amp; far across the
      hills &amp; shores for many a mile. We have had superb weather lately, yes for a month—it
      has just rained, so the dust is provided for, (that is the only thing I dread in Washington,
      the dust, I dont mind the mud). It is now between one &amp; two o'clock Thursday afternoon. I am much
      alone in this pleasant far-up room, as Major is absent sick, &amp; the clerk lays off
      a good deal. From three to five hours a day or night I go regularly among the sick,
      wounded, dying young men. I am enabled to give them things, food &amp;c. There are very
      few visitors, amateurs, now. It has become an old story. The suffering ones cling
      to me, poor children, very close. I think of coming to New York quite soon to stay
      perhaps three weeks, then sure return here.<sup><a href="#loc.00795_n100" id="r4">4</a></sup>

   <p id="loc.00795_n2">1. For accounts of these New
      York friends, see Whitman's letters from 
       and 
      . After Horace
      Traubel read this letter on January 20, 1889, Whitman observed: "I was always
      between two loves at that time: I wanted to be in New York, I had to be in
      Washington: I was never in the one place but I was restless for the other: my
      heart was distracted" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [New York: Rowman and Littlefield, 1961], 3:581).<a href="#r1">[back]
