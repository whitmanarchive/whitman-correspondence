         April, 1881.

      <br></br>Salt Lake City, U.T.,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">15 April, 1881.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am emboldened—a word I dislike and think I never before used—to address
      you—and shall hope for a line at least in reply, for I would be glad to see
      your "hand-write" since I may never clasp your right hand, and to have your
      autograph—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This, from "The Poetry of the Future", prompts me to address you:</p>
   
   
   <p>"I have thought that the invisible root out of which the poetry deepest in, and
      dearest to, humanity grows, is Friendship".
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I do not intend to 
      burthen
      
       you with many words; but I would fain suggest to <u>you</u> that herein may at 
      length be read
      the world-riddle of "Shakspeare" and his empire over the race of men. Suppose, as I believe, 
      Shakspeare
      
       a myth—<u>the</u>
      
      Shakspeare—and substitute Bacon; by no means a new idea, but still quite new,
      as I hold and dwell upon it. In the Sonnets I find <u>the</u>
      clew to the mystery, and confirmation strong as words of holy writ of the truth, the
      grand, inspiring truth, of your own deep words. How beautifully you handle
      Tennyson—never so well, never aught like it that I have seen. The "In
      Memoriam" is the peerless <u>
         Immortelle</u> of the "Shakspeare"
      Sonnets. <u>Love</u> persuaded—convinced—convicted
      Bacon (as it may have required "Love and Death" combined to convict Tennyson) of the
      truth and
      the fact of personal immortality. Had Emerson ever loved as you (I think) have
      loved, he too would have been convicted. Ah, the soul! 
      deep souls are in (or with)
      some of us yet, however we come by them.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Tenderness, benevolence, disinterestedness, sympathy, compassion:—Love is
      infinitely more. George Eliot knows that now. Mrs. Browning knew it while she dwelt
      in flesh. She, among women, and Bacon among men, they found their Christ and knew
      him crucified—that love, to become perfect, must needs be crucified. He, too,
      who sang
   </p>
   
   
   <p><span class="indent">"Too, too contracted are these walls of flesh and takes its course</span><br>
      <span class="indent">Along the line of limitless desires,"</span><br></p>
   
   <p>Shakspeare? Wordsworth never felt that myth. He, like
      Mrs. Browning, felt (spite of all they knew, or imagined they knew) <u>felt</u>, felt the reality—Bacon.—There is
      somewhat in the sexuality of marriage barring and dwarfing, however natural and necessary
      &amp;
      of course upon the whole, beneficent—Wordsworth and his sister, Renan and his,
      Charles Lamb and his, ay, Byron and his—these may be the better ideal of human
      friendship. For there is terror—desperation—in the love of one for the same
      sex.

       T. Cobb
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Sappho? Swinburne? Ah, but <u>the use</u>
      Bacon turned his ten talents to!
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Carlyle, like Wordsworth, had neither wit nor humor, nor the musical sense. (O
      you have the last. I feel that! Has Emerson?) Albeit practiced
      performers both, I do not find in either Browning or George Eliot the
      musical sense of Mrs. Browning or even Charlotte Brontë. There are
      deep-sea soundings of the musical <u>soul</u>, beyond
      these ears. Carlyle not humorous, not witty? Sly, yes: and canny and 
      superabundantly
      
       grotesque and ever wanting to be nobler than he was or could be. His
      stomach was out of order. The sympathetic ganglia out of gear. <u>That</u> ailed Carlyle.
      "Bowels of
      compassion", we can't improve on some deep sayings in Holy Writ.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Wordsworth felt Bacon. He did not feel—poet that he was—the myth 
      Shakspeare, which so exasperated the critic's acumen in Pope and in Coleridge. Wordsworth
      like Bacon was (or at least aimed to be) a Reformer of Poetry. To either, if
      poetry had no <u>use</u>, to Wordsworth if it had not
      divinest use, away with it. Why cumbereth it the ground? Wordsworth like
      Bacon was patient, elaborate, methodical. He is 
      e'en
      
       content to <u>plod</u> to his ends. And was not
      Bacon? But the quick, fine, <u>instinctive</u> ear for harmony was lacking in
      Wordsworth. Bacon was all eye, all ear, all touch. Bacon was ever "mediating on that
      celestial harmony" he
      felt all about him. Wit—humor—these,
      moreover, were lacking in Wordsworth, and without them no modern poet can hope to
      be a dramatic poet in any high sense. Had Wordsworth been the <u>humanitarian</u> Bacon was, or approaching Bacon in this
      respect, the French Revolution would have struck deeper chords in him than it
      did; but the chords were not there to strike. Wordsworth was <u>[
         <span class="unclear">selfy?</span>]
         </u> as Milton was The
      Puritanic leaven was
      not quite out even of Wordsworth, which is so offensive in his friend Southey. Bacon,
      through his mother, was
      certainly thus leavened—but the age of  licence and splendid pageantry and
      personal and material heroism neutralized all evil effects, which when the
      contest for the truth faith
      reachd its grand climax crampd and sourd Milton making him 
      austere and spiteful. Bacon was a "bashful" man. He
      tells us so himself, and was "without arrogancy or overweening"; Most
      devout, most Catholic, and at the same time (as Emerson says of 
      Shakspeare, in touching upon the Sonnets—those
      soul-and-body-tell-tale Sonnets, Mr. Whitman) "the most
      susceptible of human beings". But do you recall Wordsworth's Preface to the
      Second Edition of his poems?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"The <u>remotest</u> discoveries of the Chemist, the Botanist, or
      mineralogist, will be as proper objects of the poet's art as any upon which it
      can be employed, if the time should ever come when these things shall be <u>familiar</u> to us, and the relations under which they are
      contemplated by the followers of the respective sciences <u>shall be manifestly and palpably material to us as enjoying and suffering beings</u>."

   <p><span class="indent">"There spake my brother; (Lord Bacon) There my father's grave</span><br>
      <span class="indent">Did utter forth a voice!"—</span><br></p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p><span class="indent">"That time is past,</span><br>

      <span class="indent">And all its giddy raptures. Not for this</span><br>
      <span class="indent">Faint I, nor mourn, nor murmur."</span><br></p>
   
   
   
   <p>One feels the echo of Milton in the close—"Not for this," etc. but the
      "aching joys" and "giddy raptures" the writer of those "Sonnets" of 
      Shakspeare
      
      
      <u>knew</u>, and the language of Wordsworth is far too
      intense to describe mere   adventurous boyhood? O the unwritten, unwritable, but
      all-influencing experiences—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Why, the whole <u>tone</u> of the "Shakspeare" writings is courtly and aristocratic. Now this tone could not
      possibly
      have been assumed and maintained—counterfeited. It is pervasive in the
      blood. Bacon could teach and did teach royalty state—Shakspeare teach King's state, as Talma taught
      Napoleon?
      I fail to see the point, Mr. Emerson.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I read "12<u>th</u> Night" as a sequel to or 
      illuminating commentary upon the Sonnets. <u>Viola</u>—Feste—the
      last the mocking phantasm (sad enough, if one reads deep enough) and the musical,
      
      unsex'd
      
       soul of that "strange malady" the Sonnets treat of, escaping in those
      sighs of Viola, who never told her love, nor <u>could</u> tell, nor a billionth part
      thereof. "Confusion of sentiments" in 12<u>th</u> Night
      too.
