   <p>I am sorry that I can't give you a good report of Wm.<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> but he has
      had two bad nights, &amp; a bad day, vomiting, &amp; very weak. Night before last I hardly
      slept any, &amp; as a consequence am  not able to use my eyes next day. 
      Tho' we have a man now, he does not get a chance to do much if I am about, as I am
      preferred. I wish I could do 
      <u>all</u>. I do nearly all. I hope you are better. All cards
      welcome

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
