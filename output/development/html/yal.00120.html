   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00120_n1">1. Since Eldridge wrote to
      Walt Whitman on  a letter which,
      according to his own notation, was "answ'd Aug 19," and since Eldridge was in
      Camden on August 5 (Whitman's Commonplace Book), he is the logical recipient of
      this letter. I have combined transcriptions from two auction records.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00120_n2">2. In the fragment of
      Eldridge's letter mounted in Whitman's Commonplace Book, there is no reference
      to his mother.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00120_n3">3. Buchanan's satirical poem
      "Socrates in Camden, with a Look Around" appeared in <em>The
         Academy</em> on August 15. The poem was an offshoot of his visit with
      Whitman on April 8 (Whitman's Commonplace Book), which he recorded in <em>A Look Round Literature</em> (1887). See also Harold Blodgett,
      <em>Walt Whitman in England</em> (1934), 84-85.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00120_n4">4. O'Connor was at Bucke's
      home in Canada in August (Whitman's Commonplace Book). When Bucke wrote to Walt
      Whitman on , O'Connor was about to
      leave Canada. He was with Whitman on September 24 and 25 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r4">[back]
