      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My feeling and attitude about a volume of selections from my Leaves by Mr. Rosetti,
      
      for London publication, are simply passive ones—yet with decided satisfaction 
      that if the job is to be done, it is to be by such hands.<sup><a href="#pri.00011_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Perhaps, too, 
      "good-natured," as you advise—certainly not ill-natured. I wish Mr. Rosetti 
      to know that I appreciate <em>his</em> appreciation, realize his delicacy 
      &amp; honor, &amp; warmly thank him for his literary friendliness.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have no objection to his substituting other words—leaving it all to his own tact,
      
      &amp;c.—for "onanist," "father-stuff" &amp;c.<sup><a href="#pri.00011_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Briefly, I hereby empower him, 
      (since that seems to be the pivotal affair, &amp; since he has the kindness 
      to shape his action so much by my wishes—&amp; since, indeed, the sovereignty 
      of the responsibility is not at all mine in the case,)—to make verbal changes 
      of that sort, wherever, for reasons sufficient to him, he decides that 
      they are indispensable. I would add that it is a question with me 
      whether the introductory essay or prose preface to the first edition is worth printing.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Calamus" is a common word here. It is the very large &amp; aromatic grass, 
      or rush, growing about water-ponds in the valleys—[spears about three feet high—often
      called "sweet flag"—grows all over the Northern and Middle States—(see Webster's Large
      Dictionary—Calamus—definition 2).]<sup><a href="#pri.00011_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> The recherché or ethereal 
      sense of the term, as used in my book, arises probably from the actual Calamus 
      presenting the biggest &amp; hardiest kind of spears of grass—and their fresh, aquatic,
      pungent bouquet.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I write this to catch to-morrow's steamer from New York. 
      It is almost certain I shall think of other things—moving me to write you further
      in a week or so.

      On , Moncure D. Conway reported
      to Walt Whitman that John Camden Hotten had "contracted with W. M. Rossetti
      to prepare and edit a volume of selections from your Poems." William Michael
      Rossetti received £25 and twelve copies of the book; see William Michael
      Rossetti, <em>Rossetti Papers</em> (New York: Charles
      Scribner's Sons, 1903), 240. Conway noted as advantages of this new plan
      that a volume of selections would prepare the public for the complete work,
      and that it was better to have a well-known English critic introduce an
      American poet to the British public than an unknown American author like
      O'Connor; according to Whitman's 
      letter to Conway, O'Connor was originally named as the introduction's
      author. The irony, of course, was that Walt Whitman had written the
      Introduction.<br><br>
      Hotten (1832–1873) printed Swinburne's <em>Poems and
         Ballads</em> when another publisher withdrew after the book caused a
      furor. Perhaps because he had lived in the United States from 1848 to 1856,
      Hotten introduced to an English audience such writers as Robert Lowell,
      Artemus Ward, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Bret Harte. After his death, his
      business was purchased by Chatto and Windus. In his letter to Conway on
      December 5, 1866, O'Connor had suggested Hotten as the English publisher of
      Walt Whitman: "Seems to me the courage that prints Laus Veneris might dare
      this" (Yale). <a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="pri.00011_n2">2. In addition, Rossetti
      requested permission to delete "venereal sores or discolorations" and "any
      depravity of young men" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.; Horace Traubel,
      <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.44.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996], 3:298).
      Rossetti noted in his diary, on November 28, 1867, O'Connor's "distaste" for the
      "concession to the outcry against W's indecencies" and his intimation that
      "Whitman, though resigned, is not really pleased at the publication of a mere
      selection from his poems" (William Michael Rossetti, <em>Rossetti
         Papers</em> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1903], 244).<a href="#r2">[back]

      has been supplied from the draft version. Someone cut out Walt Whitman's
      signature in the original. Rossetti quoted this definition in a note; see <em>Poems by Walt Whitman</em>, 390<em>n</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
