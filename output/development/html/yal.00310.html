      and wanted money for his
      mother i give him a little change
      and as i supposed he wanted
      it for himself as edd<sup><a href="#duk.00425_n13" id="r10">10</a></sup> said
      he had a boy waiting for him outside
      loo<sup><a href="#duk.00615_n6" id="r11">11</a></sup>  wanted me when she was here
      to find out when jims  birth day<sup><a href="#yal.00310_n17" id="r12">12</a></sup>
      was so i wrote a little note and
      sent it by george for nanc<sup><a href="#duk.00423_n4" id="r13">13</a></sup>
      to
      write it down and i beleive 
      it was the next day nanc sent
      a boy here with a letter and
      said she was on the street
      the night before and dreadful
      to read) the boy said it was a
      strange boy she said he must
      wait for an answer i told
      the boy i was sorry for her but
      i had no money to help her
      she said in the letter i could take
      george if i wanted too<sup><a href="#yal.00310_n12" id="r14">14</a></sup>
      
      
      so saturday  night georgey
      came again after money
      he was very ragged but
      i had none to give i think
      he is very bad boy indeed
      i think the saturday  night he
      wanted it for himself)
      well after i had been so
      annoyed with the letter and
      georgey s  coming) i had a
      letter from mr Heyde<sup><a href="#duk.00426_n8" id="r15">15</a></sup>
      he had said in a former letter
      he was going to dispose of some
      pictures at montreal he said this
      in his last letter he hadent 
      sold them yet he was waiting
      to hear more particulars
      and that he had got 150 dollr 
      from the bank and gave his note
      for three months and if he
      had to take up any more money
      he should come strait  to
      brooklyn) well walt i
      had to laughf  i thought
      that was worse than nanc
      i dont  suppose he had any
      idea of coming but it seemed
      to me so rediculous  he dident 
      say whether he was coming
      to live on me or what
      he was going to doo
      
      he said han<sup><a href="#duk.00467_n1" id="r16">16</a></sup> was very well
      now he wants her to come

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00310_n8">1. This letter dates to October
      23, 1871. Because the date Monday is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, Edwin
      Haviland Miller dated the letter to January 1, 1872 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:369). Miller's date is incorrect because the letter refers to
      the marriage of Mary Isadore "Minnie" Van Nostrand (Louisa's granddaughter, the
      youngest child of Mary Van Nostrand) as having taken place on the Wednesday
      preceding Minnie's Saturday visit. Minnie married Leander Jay Young on October
      18, 1871. The Saturday that followed Minnie's October 18 (Wednesday) marriage is
      October 21, so this letter, written the following Monday, dates to October 23,
      1871.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00310_n5">2. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman (1833–1890) had recently returned to St. Louis after a visit
      to Brooklyn and his brother George Washington Whitman in Camden (see Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). Thomas Jefferson Whitman's
      mid-October 1871 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant, but the
      report on his housing situation matches his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman's October 22, 1871 letter to Louisa (see following note).<br><br>
      Jeff Whitman was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
      eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a
      nationally recognized name. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00310_n7">3. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman described their choice to stay and fix up their current residence
      after Jeff Whitman's return from his trip east: "I suppose Jeff told you
      that we were going to move but after he came back we were out about a week
      looking for a house and we found we couldn't find any as good as the one we
      are in for the same rent so we went to work and fixed this one and what with
      Plumbers, Carpenters, Chimney-sweeps, painters, and house cleaners I have
      had my hands full but we are nicely fixed now" (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1971], 72).<br><br>
      Mattie and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868,
      Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved
      there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of Water Works. For
      more on Mattie, see Waldron, <em>Mattie</em>,
      1–26.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00310_n9">4. Mary Isadore "Minnie" Van
      Nostrand (1851–1938) was the daughter of Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's elder daughter, and
      Mary's husband Ansel Van Nostrand. Minnie married Leander Jay Young
      (1846–1937) on October 18, 1871 (see Gertrude A. Barber, compiler,
      "Marriages of Suffolk County, N.Y. Taken from the 'Republican Watchman': A
      Newspaper Published at Greenport, N.Y. Years 1871, 1872, 1873, 1874, 1875,
      1876," [1950], 1:3, http://longislandgenealogy.com/MarriagesofSuffolk.pdf). For
      more on the Van Nostrand family, see Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,

   <p id="yal.00310_n14">5. The St. Nicholas Hotel on
      Broadway was one of New York City's premiere hotels in the 1870s and was a
      favorite among the "flashily-dressed, loud-voiced, and self-asserting" people
      (James D. McCabe, <em>Lights and Shadows of New York Life: or, the
         Sights and Sensations of the Great City</em> [Philadelphia: National
      Publishing, 1872], 306). The Van Nostrands inherited wealth after the death of
      Ansel's mother Fanny Van Nostrand in March 1868 (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
       letter to Walt Whitman), and
      Louisa hinted at their propensity toward lavish display after they received the
      inheritance (see her  letter to
      Walt).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n11">6. Helen Price was the
      daughter of Abby and Edmund Price. Abby Price and her family, especially her
      daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman and his mother, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman. Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform
      movements. Price's husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and
      the couple had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in
      1852, at 2 years of age). In 1860, the Price family began to save Walt's
      letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman were included in Richard Maurice
      Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1883), and she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters to
      her mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169).<a href="#r6">[back]

         Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–1977], 2:369). Abby Price's "old complaint" is
      asthma (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt). For Walt Whitman's relationship with Abby Price
      (1814–1878) and family, see Sherry Ceniza, <em>Walt Whitman

   <p id="duk.00427_n17">9. George "Georgy" Whitman was
      the son of Walt Whitman's brother Andrew Jackson Whitman and Andrew's wife Nancy
      McClure Whitman. For more on Andrew's family, see Jerome M. Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>

   <p id="duk.00425_n13">10. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n6">11. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00310_n17">12. James "Jimmy" Whitman was
      the oldest son of Andrew Jackson Whitman (1827–1863), Walt Whitman's
      brother, and Andrew's widow Nancy McClure. Jimmy's birthday is not known, but he
      was a young boy when his father Andrew died in December 1863. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman provided an extended description of Jimmy when he was in the care of
      George Washington Whitman and Louisa Orr Whitman in 1872 (see her  letter to Walt).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00423_n4">13. Nancy McClure Whitman was
      the wife of Walt Whitman's brother, Andrew Jackson Whitman. James "Jimmy" and
      George "Georgy" were Nancy and Andrew's sons, and Nancy was pregnant with
      Andrew, Jr., when her husband died in December 1863. Andrew, Jr., died in 1868,
      and Georgy died in 1872. For Nancy and her children, see Jerome M. Loving, ed.,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>

         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00310_n12">14. As early as December 1867,
      the family of Nancy McClure, her brother Edward and his wife Jane McClure,
      enlisted the assistance of the Whitmans to have Nancy's children removed from
      her care (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). In spring 1868, Louisa asked Walt to
      write Andrew Jackson Whitman's friend James Cornwell, a judge in City Hall,
      about placing the children in an orphan asylum (see Louisa's  and her  letters to Walt). Nothing became of that effort, but Andrew, Jr.,
      the child born the spring following Andrew's death in 1863, was run over by a
      brewery wagon in September 1868 (see Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The
         Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</em> [New York:
      Macmillan, 1955], 397–398). December 1871 seemed to mark a turning point
      in Nancy McClure's attitude toward keeping the children in her care. Jimmy,
      Nancy's eldest son, lived for a time with George Washington Whitman and Louisa
      Orr Whitman in 1872 (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt). Though the cause of
      Jimmy's younger brother Georgy's death is not known, he was killed in October
      1872 (see Manahatta Whitman's
