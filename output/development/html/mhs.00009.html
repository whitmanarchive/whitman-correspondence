   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter came this morning, &amp; not until we got it could we believe in the change—so
      different from what we supposed 
      the programme was arranged to be, in St Louis, housekeeping &amp;c. Dear Hattie, it is real lonesome here since you went away—<sup><a href="#mhs.00009_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>it is more a "receiving vault" to me than ever. Thank God though I am certainly better
      this winter, &amp; more like 
      a prospect for me physically, than for now nearly four years. (It will be now four
      years the 23d of January, since 
      I was paralyzed) This makes me more cheerful &amp; buoyant under the chilling atmosphere,
      (both moral &amp; meteorological) 
      of this house. Dear girls, I sometimes lately feel as if I was going out in the world,
      to take some hand again in some 
      work that suits me, even if ever so little. Wouldn't it be a blessed thing?—You see
      dear girls I just talk freely 
      &amp; confidentially to you both—I want some one to talk to—&amp; it does me good—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Hattie, I have just got your pictures (after some delay) from the photographic printers.<sup><a href="#mhs.00009_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I will send you one <u>very</u> <u>soon</u>—&amp; will send your father one, 
      &amp; your Aunt Hannah at Burlington wants one. Your Aunt Lou has one in the parlor already,
      &amp; it looks very nice—it is 
      a plain head only, looks like an engraving, no fixings or bows or jewelry, but a simple
      fine classical head, just as I 
      wanted it—But you will see when I send it you.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your Uncle George, Aunt Lou &amp; Cousin Eddy are all well as usual. Tip<sup><a href="#mhs.00009_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> is also well as usual—It has been &amp; is very cold here—the ground 
      is all covered with snow—but it is bright to-day. I have just been out about three
      blocks off in an alley, to see 
      a poor young man James Davis,<sup><a href="#mhs.00009_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> who is dying of consumption—You know I like to visit the sick—I have to stay in most
      
      of the time just now though, as it is very slippery—Little Helen Ewing is staying
      here now—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If I keep as well as now I think of going on to New York on a visit next month. Lou
      will write to you soon.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="mhs.00009_n1">1. After visiting their
      uncle for four months, the nieces had returned to St. Louis on October 25
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On
      September 16, Whitman had attended with Hattie a performance of La Favorita at
      the Philadelphia Academy, in which Brignoli had sung. On October 24, he had gone
      to the Exposition in Philadelphia with Mrs. Fannie L. Taylor, of St. Louis, who
      probably had come to Camden to escort the young ladies home (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="mhs.00009_n2">2. Mannahatta's picture had
      been taken on October 25, and on November 12 Walt Whitman had paid a Mr. Spieler
      $5 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
