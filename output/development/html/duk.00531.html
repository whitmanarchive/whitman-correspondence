      <br></br>ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, <em xmlns="">Washington</em>,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Dec. 14, 1866.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy &amp; comrade,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter of the 9th<sup><a href="#duk.00531_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—&amp; am real glad to hear from you, &amp; that you are well &amp; in good spirits, as appears
      by your letter. You speak how much you would like to see me, &amp; we could be together
      a while. I too, dear friend, would be so glad if we were near each other where we
      could have each other's company often.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still working here in the same office—We have lately a new Attorney General<sup><a href="#duk.00531_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>—One of the first things he did was to <em>promote me</em>!—Sensible man, wasn't he?—May the Lord reward him. I have been absent on leave the
      past summer two months—went to New York—spent most of the time with my mother, in
      Brooklyn—I have been well since I last wrote to you, mostly—only the last six weeks
      have had rather a bad time with neuralgia—but am getting over it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Things with friend Hiram Frazee<sup><a href="#duk.00531_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> have gone poorly. He went from Harewood hospital here, to Brooklyn, to the City Hospital
      there—he had a terrific operation there that nearly cost him his life, &amp; after all
      did no good—it was a pay hospital, &amp; his stay in it cost him $300—The last I heard
      of Frazee was about two months ago—he was then home—his address is <em>Hiram W. Frazee, Camden, Oneida Co. New York</em>—he wrote me, &amp; said he was as comfortable as one in his condition could be—he spoke
      about you in his letter, &amp; wanted much to know about you—
   </p>
   
   <p>Wood I have not heard from.</p>
   
   <p>Here in Washington Congress is in session, &amp; rather lively times—I suppose you see
      the acc'ts in the papers.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear Comrade, you don't give me the particulars what you are doing, &amp;c. you must,
      when you write again—you speak of not being overburdened with green backs, &amp; profits
      &amp;c.—Well, boy, one can bear that, if one only keeps hearty &amp; fat &amp; in good spirits,
      as I guess you are.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, I keep about as stout as ever, and my face red &amp; great beard just the same as
      when I used to see you—I eat my rations every time, too—I am writing this in the office
      by a big window with a splendid view of the Potomac &amp; Arlington Heights—Well I find
      I must close—I send my love to you, darling boy, &amp; I want you always to keep me posted
      wherever you go, dear Comrade.

   <p id="duk.00531_n3">2. Henry Stanbery
      (1803–1881) was appointed Attorney General on July 23, 1866, and served
      until March 12, 1868, when he resigned to serve as President Johnson's chief
      counsel in the impeachment proceedings. When, at the conclusion of the trial,
      Johnson renominated Stanbery, the Senate refused to confirm him. Failing
      eyesight—to which Whitman referred in letters from , and —forced Stanbery to retire from legal practice in 1878. Speaking
      to Horace Traubel in 1888, Whitman affirmed his fondness for Stanbery (<em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard &amp;
      Company, 1906–1996], 3:156).<a href="#r2">[back]
