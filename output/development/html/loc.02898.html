   </p>
   
   <p>I have returned from my jaunt to the Jersey sea shore<sup><a href="#loc.02898_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—&amp; have rec'd yours of the 1st—Don't exactly know the scope,
      draft, <u>spine</u> of your proposed book ab't me, but entertain full faith that it has a
      reason-for-being, &amp; that it will fulfil that reason—
   </p>
   
   <p>I see in your letter, you have crossed out the "Walt" in the name—I like best
      to have the <u>full</u>
      <u>name</u> always if possible instead of merely "Whitman"<sup><a href="#loc.02898_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Give both words, &amp; don't be afraid of the
      tautology. I will help you &amp; suggest or criticise freely &amp; candidly, leaving
      the decision to you of course—hope you understand this, as it is.
   </p>
   
   <p>Very hot weather here—I am quite comfortable, though—Have you rec'd Dr
      Knortz's German lecture?<sup><a href="#loc.02898_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Burroughs is home from
      his Kentucky trip<sup><a href="#loc.02898_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Dr Bucke will be back from
      England next week<sup><a href="#loc.02898_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
