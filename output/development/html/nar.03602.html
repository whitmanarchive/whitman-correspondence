      <br></br><br></br>Mr. Elmes,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#nar.03602_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      <br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I respectfully ask to substitute the services of the bearer <em>Walter Godey</em>, in the office, 
      for the present, instead of my own—having made an arrangement with him to that effect,
      
      if permitted by you. He writes a good hand, and I think would soon get broke in, 
      and prove efficient. I would ask you to put him at my desk and give him a trial—on
      some letters first, before giving him the books—(or any other work or arrangement
      thought best.)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have had a tedious time but I seem to be now decidedly though slowly 
      recovering and hope to be in Washington before long.<sup><a href="#nar.03602_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
