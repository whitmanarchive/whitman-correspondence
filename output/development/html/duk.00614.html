   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00614_n4">1. This letter dates to between
      February 11 and February 13, 1873. The most probable date is February 12, 1873.
      Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter February 1, 1873, but its topical
      consistency and verbal echoes of letters from both Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman and Walt Whitman sets the range of possible dates between February 11
      and February 13. February 12?, 1873, the date proposed by Edwin Haviland Miller,
      is most probable (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:370). The letter reports that
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's coughing is "somewhat easier," probably in
      echo of a similar phrase in Jeff's February 7, 1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear
         Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent
      State University Press, 1984], 154). Louisa observes that Walt "will be glad to
      get out in the open air once more," and she seems to echo Walt's hope that he
      can "get out—or to the front door, at any rate" (see his  letter to Louisa). Finally, Walt
      acknowledged that he "rec'd your letter Saturday" (February 14) in his  reply. Louisa had received both
      Jeff's February 7 letter and Walt's February 10 letter, and Walt received this
      letter on February 14. Therefore, this letter dates between February 11 and
      February 13, 1873.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00614_n8">2. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman died on February 19, 1873 from complications associated with a throat
      ailment. Mattie and her husband Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman had two
      daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved
      to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
      emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa. For more on Mattie,
      see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha
         Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      1–26. Waldron reports that a physician identified the cause of death as
      cancer (3). Robert Roper has speculated that Mattie's accompanying bronchial
      symptoms may have been associated with tuberculosis (<em>Now the
         Drum of War</em> [New York: Walker, 2008], 78–79).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00614_n9">3. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's number 7 is ambiguous, but her phrase "somewhat esier [<em>sic</em>]" echoes Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's
      February 7, 1873 letter to Louisa (see Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price,
      ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson
         Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984], 154).<br><br>
      Jeff Whitman (1833–1890) was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff in 1867 became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized name. He married wife Mattie in 1859, and
      Louisa had shared their Brooklyn residence until Jeff departed for St.
      Louis. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00614_n11">4. Walt wrote that he can "get
      out—or to the front door, at any rate," and he repeated the assurance that
      he is "progressing," "improving," or "gaining" in echo of all letters since his
      paralytic stroke on January 23, 1873. See his  letter to Louis Van Velsor Whitman and the eight other
      letters between January 26 and February 9, 1873.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00614_n12">5. Jeff Whitman inquired
      whether his mother thought Walt Whitman would be able to visit St. Louis, and he
      cautioned her, "you must not be surprised to hear that it is all over with the
      dear soul at any time." Two days later, Jeff added Mattie Whitman "speaks often
      and much about you—wants to see you very, very much" (see his February 5,
      1873 and February 7, 1873 letters to Louisa Whitman in Dennis Berthold and
      Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of
         Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press,
      1984], 153–155). Walt wrote to Jeff on  that he was unable "to move from one room to the other" and so
      "can but send my love, dear, dear, sister."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00613_n1">6. Walt befriended Peter Doyle
      (1843–1907), a horsecar conductor in Washington, around 1865. Though
      Whitman informed Doyle of his flirtations with women in their correspondence,
      Martin G. Murray affirms that "Whitman and Doyle were 'lovers' in the
      contemporary sense of the word." Doyle assisted in caring for Whitman after his
      stroke in January 1873. See Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00155.html">"Pete the Great: A Biography of Peter Doyle."</a><a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00614_n3">7. Helen Price inquired
      anxiously about Walt Whitman's health and wrote that his illness had been
      reported in the papers (see her January 31, 1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman, Trent Collection, Duke University).<a href="#r7">[back]
