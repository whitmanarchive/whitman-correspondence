      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I recd both your cards,<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r1">1</a></sup> also the package of Tribunes with your letter.<sup><a href="#n0897" id="r2">2</a></sup> I happened to get the Tribune on the 4th &amp; so had seen the letter. It is re-printed in the Semi-Weekly edition also. I of
      course read it with deep interest. It is a noble eloquent letter &amp; has the old stirring
      ring. I like it immensely.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope you have weathered
      
      
      
      this heated term, It has been tremendous here. We got our baby just as the heat began,
      July 1st, &amp; we have had our hands full. He has been quite restless &amp; sleepless, &amp; we were
      both nearly worn out. He is doing better now &amp; we hope the worst is over. He is a
      bright little fellow &amp; I expect we shall "set a store" by him as the old women say
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The raspberries still hang on &amp; the currants too, but the best I can
      
      
      do now is to think of you when I eat them, which is three times a day. We have picked
      2600 lbs of currants off that patch, &amp; there are several hundred there yet. Smith
      &amp; his family are well.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The baby is lying on the lounge in my room as I write, I hear him nestle &amp; see that
      his eyes are open. So I must stop.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Guernsey<sup><a href="#n0836" id="r3">3</a></sup> had a pleasant paragraph about you &amp; your Tribune letter in the Boston Herald. 'Sula
      sends love, so does the baby.<sup><a href="#n0892" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0129">1. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0897">2. Burroughs is presumably referring
      to the article by Whitman entitled "A Poet's Recreation," which appeared in the
      <em>New York Tribune</em> on July 4, 1878 and most of which
      was reprinted in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see <em>Prose Works</em>, 1:329-330). The article was based on Whitman's
      observations of the New York surroundings in his trip of June–July
      1878.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0836">3. As is clear from the letter, Fred
      R. Guernsey was associated with the <em>Boston Herald</em>. In
      1882 the newspaper supported Whitman against the Boston censors, and quoted
      Oscar Wilde's defense (Edwin Haviland Miller, <em>Walt Whitman:
         The Correspondence</em>, [New York: New York University Press], 3:283
      n73).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0892">4. Ursula North Burroughs
      (1836–1917) was John Burroughs's wife. Ursula and John were married on
      September 12, 1857. The couple maintained a small farm overlooking the Hudson
      River in West Park, Ulster County. They adopted a son, Julian, at two months of
      age. It was only later revealed that John himself was the biological father of
      Julian.<a href="#r4">[back]
