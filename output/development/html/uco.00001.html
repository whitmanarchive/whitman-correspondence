   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uca.00001_n1">1. This letter's envelope bears the
      address, "W J Stillman | St Helen's Cottage | Ventnor | England." It is
      postmarked, "Camden | (?)| 2(?)| N.J.; Ventnor | (?)| No 6 | (?) 6."<br><br>
      Stillman (1828–1901), an American painter and art critic, visited Walt
      Whitman in Washington in December 1869, and wrote to his friend William
      Michael Rossetti of Whitman's "remarkable personal qualities"; see <em>Rossetti Papers</em>, 492, and Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.89.html">1:380–381</a>. An intimate of Ruskin and Turner, he was in the
      diplomatic service from 1862 to 1868 and a correspondent for the London <em>Times</em> from 1875 to 1898. An entry in Whitman's
      Commonplace Book corroborates the date (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).
