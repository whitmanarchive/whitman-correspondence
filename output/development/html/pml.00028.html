      <br></br><br></br>Dear Abby,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Here I am in the same office, at the same desk, writing to you again—though the
      interval I know has been too long—but I will try not to let so long a time elapse
      in
      future. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is not much difference with me, in any respect—I have been, &amp; am quite
      well, considering—though I have had trouble from a cold during the winter &amp;
      spring—My situation in the office continues the same—The new Attorney General,
      Mr. Hoar,<sup><a href="#pml.00028_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> treats me very kindly—He is from Concord, Mass.
      &amp; is personally intimate with Emerson. Washington has been swarming with
      office-seekers<sup><a href="#pml.00028_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—about half of whom have
      left—thousands <em>in disgust</em>—it is quite a curiosity to see
      them around the Departments, in the hotels, and at the White House &amp; Capitol—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The O'Connors<sup><a href="#n0452" id="r3">3</a></sup> are well as usual—William is still in the Treasury 
      Dept
      
      —I spent last Sunday evening with them, at their house—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still boarding at the same place—I expect to bring out the final edition of my
      book the ensuing summer<sup><a href="#pml.00028_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—stereotyped—(<em>positively last appearance</em> for the season &amp;c) as the play bills
      say—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Abby, I have been waiting till I felt in the mood to write a long, good [inter]esting
      letter to you [all?]<sup><a href="#pml.00028_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup>—but it's no use waiting—so I
      write this. Don't be mad at me because I have been so negligent—You all have my love
      &amp; "best respects" to boot—how I should like just to come in &amp; spend the
      afternoon &amp; evening with you—&amp; Helen &amp; Emily<sup><a href="#pml.00028_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup>—&amp; then have a good bouncing argument with Mr. Arnold,<sup><a href="#pml.00028_n6" id="r7">7</a></sup> about finances, patriotism, &amp;c &amp;c—<em>What do you think of
         Grant</em>—his doings—especially some of his diplomatic
      appointments—Washburn,<sup><a href="#pml.00028_n7" id="r8">8</a></sup> for instance? 
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Good bye, dear friends—Love to you all. 
      <br></br>Walt.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Abby H. Price
      (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
      husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
      children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
      age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
      were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
      Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for
      the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother in <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 (1908): 163–169. In a letter to Ellen M.
      O'Connor from , Whitman declared
      with emphasis, "<em>they are all friends</em>, to prize and love
      deeply."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pml.00028_n1">1. Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar (1816–1895)
      was Attorney General from 1869 to 1870 and was later a member of the U.S. House
      of Representatives. Evidently during the last month of Johnson's administration
      Walt Whitman had some uncertain moments as to his future, for on  his mother asked: "walt what is
      it you alluded to that was 
      disagreable
      
       in the office." In his additions to the second edition of <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, As Poet and Person</em> (New York: J.
      S. Redfield, 1871) John Burroughs wrote cryptically: "and afterward, (1869,) he
      is subjected, in another Department, to trains of dastardly official insolence
      by a dignitary of equal rank [to Harlan], from whom he narrowly escapes the same
      fate" (123).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0452">3. For a time Walt Whitman lived with William D. and
      Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to
      be his close associates during the early Washington years. William Douglas
      O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>,
      an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. He had been an
      assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> before he
      went to Washington. O'Connor was one of Whitman's strongest defenders, most
      notably in his 1866 pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" (a digital version of the
      pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). The poet praised O'Connor in the
      preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was born sample here in the
      19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood.
      Thrice blessed be his memory!" In 1872, while living in the O'Connors' home,
      Whitman strongly disagreed with O'Connor over the Fifteenth Amendment, which
      Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended Whitman's opinion, and in
      response William moved out. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>." <a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="pml.00028_n3">4. In a publicity blurb in the Washington <em>Sunday Chronicle</em> on May 9, 1869 (reprinted by Emory
      Holloway, <em>American Mercury</em>, 18 1929, 482–483), Walt
      Whitman spoke of his plans for the summer: a new edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, "the collection, revised, and including his new
      verses on religious themes," and <em>Democratic Vistas</em>. These
      works did not appear until 1871.<a href="#r4">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00028_n5">6. On , Louisa Van Velsor Whitman informed her son that "Emily price is
      going to get married ... his name is law an artist in the cheap picture
      line."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00028_n6">7. A friend of the Prices, John Arnold lived
      with his daughter's family in the same house as the Price family. Helen Price
      described him as "a Swedenborgian," with whom Walt Whitman frequently argued
      without "the slightest irritation between them"; see Richard Maurice Bucke, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883),
      26–27.<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="pml.00028_n7">8. Elihu Benjamin Washburne (1816–1887)
      served as Grant's Secretary of State for a few days and then resigned to become
      minister to France.<a href="#r8">[back]
