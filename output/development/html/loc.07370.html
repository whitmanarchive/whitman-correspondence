   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Elisa Seaman Leggett,
      grandmother of the artist Percy Ives, corresponded sporadically with Whitman
      from 1880 until his death. A number of her letters to him are reprinted in
      Thomas Donaldson's <em>Walt Whitman: The Man</em> (New York:
      Francis P. Harper, 1896), 239–48. See also Joann P. Krieg, "Walt Whitman's
      Long Island Friend: Elisa Seaman Leggett," <em>Long Island
         Historical Journal</em> 9 (Spring 1997), 223–33.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07370_n2">1. This abbreviation of "ed,"
      adopted by Whitman throughout <em>Specimen Days</em>, probably did
      not appear in Leggett's original letter.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07370_n1">2. Leggett is referring to
      Elias Hicks (1748–1830), a Quaker from Long Island whose controversial
      teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of Friends in 1827, a division
      that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a friend of Whitman's father
      and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter and proponent of Hicks's
      teachings. This letter excerpt begins Whitman's "Reminiscence of Elias Hicks" in
      <em>Specimen Days</em>, where Whitman writes that accompanying
      Leggett's letter was "a rare old engraved head of Elias Hicks, (from a portrait
      in oil by Henry Inman, painted for J. V. S., must have been 60 years or more
      ago, in New York)." For more on Hicks and his influence on Whitman, see David S.
      Reynolds, <em>Walt Whitman's America</em> (New York: Knopf, 1995),
      37–39.<a href="#r2">[back]
