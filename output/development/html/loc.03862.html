   <p>Quite froze up here, but ab't as usual, tho' a trifle less well than common this
      winter—a bad obstinate cold in the head among the rest—I don't get out
      at all—I am writing a little to order—got up late to-day—had
      chocolate &amp; buckwheat cakes with quince jelly for my breakfast—am sitting
      here by a good fire—How are you all?—I wish Ed<sup><a href="#n0589c" id="r1">1</a></sup> or

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).
