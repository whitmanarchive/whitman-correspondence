      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend, &amp; Bee, Herby &amp; Giddy—  
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am down here at Kirkwood—Came down here some four days ago<sup><a href="#loc.03960_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—am having a real hearty old-fashioned time, for me—Harry came up for me in the light
      wagon, the day but one after I was last at your house—a delightful ride down here—&amp;
      yesterday afternoon one of those nice long rambling drives with George Stafford, in
      the roomy old light wagon, (a good part of the road through the piney woods, which
      I always enjoy so much)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The weather has been &amp; is pleasant—a little cool to-day, but the sun shining out as
      I write—I was down by the creek most of the forenoon—&amp; shall go down for an hour again
      this evening—bright moonlight nights—I am quite happy here, for me—We live well, keep
      good wood fires—&amp; have plenty of chicken, eggs &amp; fresh pork (they kill a hog about
      every two or three weeks)—Mr Stafford is pretty well—he has been out all day with
      the team hauling marl—Mrs Stafford is well—Harry &amp; the rest ditto—Mrs Stafford thanks
      you kindly for the medicine—I don't know what day I shall come up—Love to you all—
   </p>

      Whitman arrived in Kirkwood on Saturday, February 16, and in his Commonplace
      Book he mentioned his stay with the Staffords from "16th to 23d inclusive"
