      <br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd yours of April 7th &amp; believe me I fully respond to your cheery greetings &amp; kind wishes—I
      am pretty well for me (call myself now a <em>half-paralytic</em>)—am much of the time in the country &amp; on the water<sup><a href="#nyp.00414_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—yet take deep interest in the world &amp; all its bustle, (though perhaps keeping it
      at arm's length)—I send you a Boston paper same mail with this, an "Emerson number"
      that may interest you—a piece by me in it<sup><a href="#nyp.00414_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—After you are through with it, send it to Mr Tennyson, if you think proper—&amp; should
      you do me kindness to write me again (I hope you will) send me Mr T's post office
      address (a good permanent one that whatever sent to will finally reach him)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are having a dash of the hottest weather here ever known, &amp; I am standing it finely.
      I believe I sent you a month ago a little paper with my late piece "Riddle Song."
      The early summer is very fine here, &amp; I am enjoying it, even heat and all—I live on
      the banks of the Delaware river like—I wish you could know my dear friend Mrs Gilchrist
      &amp; her family, now 5 Mount Vernon, Hampstead—they were three years here in America—Best
      respects &amp; love to you—
   </p>
