   <p id="n4195">2. Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), a volume Whitman often referred to
      as the "big book," was published by Philadelphia publisher David McKay in
      December 1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, he made the presswork and
      binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the book, which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more information on
      the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
