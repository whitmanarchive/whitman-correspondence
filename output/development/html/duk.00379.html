      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#duk.00379_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Jimmy is getting along favorably as usual but of course somewhat slowly. I was with
      him night before last, &amp; am going again this afternoon. It requires a good deal of
      patience in him to lay so steadily confined in bed, but he still has the good luck
      to continue remarkably free from any acute suffering. Night before last he had some
      pain &amp; swelling in the foot &amp; leg below the wound, but nothing of serious account.
      They bandaged it pretty tightly, &amp; that seemed to relieve it. Jim wished me to write
      to <em>you</em> this time, &amp; I promised him night before last to do so. I wrote at that time from
      the hospital to your parents at Comac, &amp; sent the letter yesterday. Jim is dissatisfied
      unless I write pretty often, whether there is any thing to write about or not—My friend,
      I rec'd your note about your folks getting your dear brother's body from down in Virginia.<sup><a href="#duk.00379_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Dear friend, the rebels have lately advanced upon us, as you doubtless know, &amp; held
      Culpepper &amp; thereabout for many days past—but the rumor now is that they are falling
      back, &amp; that Meade will probably take possession of his old ground<sup><a href="#duk.00379_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—but at present I doubt if any thing could be done—the authorities here do not grant
      passes yet, they are stricter than ever—
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear friends all, I would say to you as I have written to Jimmy's parents, that I
      shall try to keep watch of the boy, as I shall probably continue in Washington for
      some time yet—&amp; if any thing should occur I will write to you—as it may be some reliance
      to you &amp; make you feel less uneasy, to feel that Jim can have nothing occur in his
      case without your being informed—though as far as now appears, he will go on favorably, &amp; his wound is likely to heal so that he can sit up, &amp; then gradually move
      about, &amp; so in due time be able to travel—
   </p>
   
   <p>So, my friend, farewell for present, &amp; I pray that God may be with you, &amp; though we
      are strangers I send my love to you &amp; all Jimmy's sisters &amp; brothers in law—for in
      times of trouble &amp; death folks draw near in spirit regardless of being separated by
      distance, or of being personally strangers—

   <p id="duk.00379_n2">2. James S. Stilwell, Second
      New York Cavalry, was confined in Ward C of Armory Square with a gunshot wound
      in his left leg; see "Notebook: September–October, 1863" (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection) and "Hospital Notes" (Henry E. Huntington Library). He
      recovered slowly from his injury. About the end of May in the following year he
      was sent to Mower Hospital, Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania, where he remained until
      he was granted a furlough in August 1864. He later returned to Mower Hospital
      and wrote to Whitman on , that
      his wound was "most healed up," and that he expected either to be discharged or
      to be transferred to New York. See also Stilwell's letters to Whitman from , and . He was the brother of Julia and John Stilwell.When Horace
      Traubel received this draft letter from Whitman, he noted that "it was addressed
      to Julia Elizabeth Stilwell, South Norwalk, Connecticut" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, [New York: Rowman and
      Littlefield, 1961], 1:434). After Traubel had read the letter, Whitman said
      "fervently": "I thank God for having permitted me to write that letter." As
      Whitman indicated in a letter from 
      , he corresponded
      frequently with members of the Stilwell family. John and Margaret Stilwell on
      , wrote: "I hope God will
      bless you in your basket and in your Store, in your Soul and in your body.…be a
      father and a Mother to him"; and on , Margaret wrote to Whitman: "You have been More than a brother to
      James and to his Sisters and to us his parents More than a Son." <a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00379_n3">3. John Stilwell, brother of
      James and Julia Stilwell, was evidently killed at Culpeper, Virginia, about the
      time that James was wounded, for Julia Stilwell wrote to Whitman about both
      brothers on . Whitman was mistaken
      about the body, however, since, according to Margaret Stilwell's letter of , members of the family had been
      refused a pass to Culpeper.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00379_n4">4. The <em>New
         York Herald</em> reported this rumor on the following day.<a href="#r4">[back]
