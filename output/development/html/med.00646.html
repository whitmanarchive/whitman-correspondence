   <p>I ... return'd last evening from ten days down in the Jersey woods....<sup><a href="#med.00646_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I have just concluded a contract with J. R. Osgood and Co of Boston for the publishing
      of my poems complete in one volume, under the title of "Walt Whitman's Poems" (the
      old name of "Leaves of Grass" running through the same as ever)—to be either a
      $2. book or a $2.50 one—if the former, I to have 25 
      cts
      
       royalty, if the latter, 30 
      cts)—The proposition for publication came from them. The bulk of the
      pieces will be the same as hitherto—only I shall secure now the
      consecutiveness and <em>ensemble</em> I am always thinking
      of—Book will probably be out before winter.
   </p>
   
   <p>Nothing very new otherwise—you must have kept posted about my Boston jaunt, for
      I sent you papers—it was altogether a curious success—not so much in
      quantity as quality—
   </p>
   
   <p>Last January, I think it was, I took a bad chill—bothered me for over two
      months, lingering along—but I believe the Boston jaunt drove the last of it
      away....
   </p>
   
   <p>My forthcoming summer movements are not exactly decided—probably go on to
      Boston for two or three weeks, as I like to keep a sharp eye on my proofs and
      typography—then I must go a month in Canada—I will keep you posted, and
      will try to pay you a visit, too<sup><a href="#med.00646_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—how is 'Sula? Write soon.

   <p id="med.00646_n2">1. Whitman was on the
      Stafford farm from June 11 through 15 (<em>Daybooks and
         Notebooks</em>, ed. William White [New York: New York University Press,
      1978] 1:244).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="med.00646_n1">2. On  Burroughs wrote to Whitman inviting him to
      Esopus, New York, and promising to visit Camden shortly (T. E. Hanley
      Collection, University of Texas). With his letter Whitman sent a copy of "A
      Summer's Invocation" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
