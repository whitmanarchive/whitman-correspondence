      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your kind post card of the 8<u>th</u> inst. and papers just to
      hand. My cordial thanks to you.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>D<u>r</u> Johnston<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r1">1</a></sup> has already told you of
      the open air meeting held by our friends last Saturday-afternoon—the 13<u>th</u> inst—4 miles from Bolton— to hear his account of
      his visit to you and to West Hills.—It was a perfect September
      day,—warm, calm and bright, with a slight, pensive autumnal haze veiling the
      distance. We gathered together under the shade of a tree in the fields and listened
      for over an hour and a half to the D<u>r's</u> story and examined
      the photos he handed round as he proceeded. It brought you very near to us all and
      every heart was stirred as the D<u>r</u> told us of your great
      kindness to him, and of your kind messages to us all—since repeated, again +
      again, in your post cards to me. In the talk which followed a general feeling was
      expressed that our united gratitude, thanks + affection should be conveyed to you,
      and I was commissioned to write to you.— It gives me great pleasure to do so for
      our little society owes its very existence, indirectly, to you, and we are all, in
      greater or less degree, your admirers + lovers.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>One of the friends (Thomas Shonock) has since asked me to procure a copy of the
      pocket book edition of L. of G. for him. So I will enclose a money order for
      $22/—, I shall be glad if you will send one at your convenience. I am just beginning my
      holidays (long needed) + your book accompanies me in all my rambles. I am spending
      the first few days at home and taking solitary walks in the lonely country lanes and
      on the moors near here. With you for company I have all I wish and spend blessed
      hours of sacred, vital communion with the wordless divine Spirit that informs all
      things and with my
      own soul. How near and dear <u>you</u> are to me I cannot tell
      you. But I am sure that no author before ever appealed to such depths of a man's
      nature, or aroused such tender, personal love. Very sure am I that your now despised
      poems will yet rank with the Hebrew Scriptures (to which alone I can compare them)
      as sacred and priceless—springing from divine depths—the latest modern revelation of
      the same Spirit.
   </p>
   
   <p>I will enclose a cutting from last weeks paper giving another instance (at a place
      a
      few miles from here) of the latent heroism of the roughest classes.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
