   <p>I send you the enclosed piece (printed in a paper here, with my consent) <sup><a href="#pri.00014_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> —quite willing you should have it put, if convenient, 
      in the <u>Academy</u>, or any other literary gazette, your way, if thought proper. My theory is that <u>the plain truth</u> 
      of the situation here is best stated. It is even worse <u>than</u> described in the article.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>With me, things are going on as for a year or two past—am no worse—work a little—still
      remain in Camden. 
      I rec'd your letter—have seen of late months Joaquin Miller,<sup><a href="#pri.00014_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> M. D. Conway, Lord Houghton,<sup><a href="#pri.00014_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> <u>&amp;c</u> I have lately heard from, but not seen, Marvin,<sup><a href="#pri.00014_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> my Boston friend. John Burroughs was here with me last week. He is well. I have about
      
      got ready my two Volumes—"Leaves of Grass" remains about the same, (a few new bits)
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      "Two Rivulets," the other Vol., 
      has some new stuff—will write further to you soon anent of the books.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Was interested &amp; pleased with your letter about the dinner<sup><a href="#pri.00014_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—sent it to Marvin to read. I have seen Peter Bayne's piece<sup><a href="#pri.00014_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—have also seen the friendly &amp; glowing article of Arthur Clive in the <u>Gentleman's</u> <u>Magazine</u>.<sup><a href="#pri.00014_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> Who is A. C.?—When you write tell me <u>som</u>ething about him.

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pri.00014_n1">1. "Walt Whitman's Actual
      American Position," which appeared in the West Jersey Press on January 26, was
      Whitman's anonymous reply to the article in the Springfield <em>Republican</em> of January 18, which attacked the "loose talk" of Joaquin
      Miller and others that Whitman was "a neglected martyr," and averred that
      Whitman was "not yet in want, though three years of illness and enforced
      idleness have used up his savings." In the West Jersey <em>Press</em>, Whitman protested his neglect by American readers, publishers,
      and poets. He had recently printed, he declared, a two-volume edition of his
      complete writings "'to keep the wolf from the door' in old age." See Clifton
      Joseph Furness, <em>Walt Whitman's Workshop</em> (Cambridge:
      Harvard University Press, 1928), 245–246. Rossetti printed excerpts from
      the article in <em>The Athenaeum</em> on March 11, and also quoted
      the last two sentences of the first paragraph of this letter. According to
      Rossetti's letter on February 28 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.), the editor
      of <em>The Academy</em> had showed no interest in publishing the
      account.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="pri.00014_n2">2. Miller had visited
      Whitman in June, 1875; See the letter from Whitman to William James Linton of

   <p id="pri.00014_n4">4. Marvin had recently
      returned from England; see the letter from Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of , and the letter from Whitman to
      John Burroughs of .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00014_n5">5. In his letter of December
      23, 1875, Rossetti had described a dinner given in honor of Marvin (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.); see the letter from Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of

   <p id="pri.00014_n6">6. Bayne (1830–1896),
      a Scottish journalist, in <em>The Contemporary Review</em> 28
      (December 1875), 49–69, attacked Whitman's English admirers, Rossetti,
      Dowden, and Buchanan, as well as <em>Leaves of Grass</em>: "While
      reading Whitman, . . . I realized with bitter painfulness how deadly is the
      peril that our literature may pass into conditions of horrible disease, the
      raging flame of fever taking the place of natural heat, the ravings of delirium
      superseding the enthusiasm of poetical imagination, the historians of tetanic
      spasm caricaturing the movements, dance-like and music-measured, of harmonious
      strength." Bayne's diatribe was reprinted in <em>The Living
         Age</em> 128 (8 January 1876), 91–102. See also <em>The
         Nation</em> 22 (13 January 1876), 28–29. In the West Jersey <em>Press</em> Whitman referred to "the scolding and cheap abuse
      of Peter Bayne" (Clifton Joseph Furness, <em>Walt Whitman's
         Workshop</em> [1928], 246). See also Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman
         and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (1931), 121 and 126.<a href="#r6">[back]

      of Joy," by the Irish poet Standish James O'Grady, appeared in <em>The Gentleman's Magazine</em> 15 (1875), 704–716. See the letters
      from Whitman to Edward Dowden of
