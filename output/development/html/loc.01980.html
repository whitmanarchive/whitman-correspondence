   <p>Your kind letter received me some time since and owing to your intended pleasure trip
      I did not reply at the time, but have been 
      noticeing
      
       the press for note of your return to your official
      duties &amp; your paper so informed me—I trust your trip has
      been one of pleasure as well as profit—mental &amp; pecuniary—but alack:
      pecuniary profits to authors &amp; literary men are small and often
      meagre as to pennies The [

      the Gold
      
      —this I know from the experience of some literary friends here. "B.F.
      Taylor—" son of Benj F. "Snacks"—Gideon B
      Thompson—who I think may 
      mak
      
       a mark in the world of letters in years to come, yet the past has been any
      thing but bright or encouraging.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was highly pleased with the article of Col Stinton and think he even drew mildly
      upon facts as to your Hospital career. none perhaps can appreciate the kindness
      extended by you, more than I, while a hospital [
      <span class="unclear">truant?</span>]
      , stranger like them, yet the
      positiveness of your nature drew upon those lives of friendship and fellow love,
      that in many natures  are not reached by years of culture. Slow as I have always been
      to form friends, I found myself anxious to call you such in a few short
      days—and how many more have you met like me in the past eight years. But more
      of this anon, how no doubt "Leaves of Grass" will progress to a
      close, by the way I have been asked several times where your books could be obtained
      &amp; as I had sent the paper with Col It's better for my 
      freind
      
       B.F. Taylor without making note of it. I have been unable to answer &amp;
      besides the American News Co to whom we have sent, 
      enforms
      
       that your "Leaves of Grass" are out of print. Send me the desired
      information in your next letter.

   <p>What can you be doing at Washington now, and the elections so close at hand? a 
      freind
      
       to the poor &amp; downtrodden [
      <span class="unclear">of?</span>]
       our country. I would naturally suppose you to be in New
      York working as I work for the election of Horatio Seymour. all
      have their [
      <span class="unclear">influx?</span>]
       and
      you no doubt could bring some to our aid. The affections of the Union Army are of
      the past. Our foe—working—calls for help. And shall we who have the
      welfare of our common country at heart refuse to lend that helping hand they now so
      much need. I am sorry to see that during the campaign the rebellion has been fought
      over  and over
      again—by patriots—who never knew the battle cry, the [
      <span class="unclear">terrors?</span>]
       and excitement
      attending these—past issues—let them be of the past. Our country and the
      fallen foe both need our aid. can we 
      withold
      
       them? The west is Democratic but fraud upon fraud has given the three
      [
      <span class="unclear">critical?</span>]
       states
      to our opponents and we hope to redeem all on tuesday. Ohio is the only one in
      doubt, and I hope even for it. But ere this reaches you the day will have passed
      &amp; all decided
   </p>
   
   <p>The West is a great country and your summer trip next should be extended hitherward
      where you may judge of the country people and their hospitality.

   <p>With kind regards of my family to you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
