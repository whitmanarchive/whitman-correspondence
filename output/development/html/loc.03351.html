      <br xmlns="" class="opener">5.3.79.
      
      <br></br><br></br>My dear Friend and Master,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>About twelve years since, I was in Boston and looking at the books of an old book-stall
      in a passage of Washington St. when I saw your "Leaves of Grass", opened the book,
      and saw <u>a Revelation</u>. I was 'poor', the book was 'expensive', but I felt that whatever the 'cost' I must
      posses it. No words will serve to indicate the value your living words have been to me.
      In all my troubles and successes I have been strengthened by
      
      
      
      your divine teachings. You are not only inspired yourself, but you inspire others.
      Though most of the people I have read extracts, or lent your book, to have utterly
      failed to appreciate you, I have never faltered in my faith and love, and have always
      esteemed you as the Messenger of this age. (My <u>words</u> seem utterly paltry and drivelling, and I am thoroughly ashamed of them. But you
      know what I desire to utter.)
   </p>
   
   <p>A few years since, I
      
      
      
      met a lady, named Miss Bernard, in London. She was from Washington, and was personally
      acquainted with you, and she promised to send me your photograph. I have never received
      it, and wish <u>you</u> to send it, and also to send me, <u>if you can</u>, a copy of your <u>original edition</u> of 'Leaves of Grass'. (I lent mine, and it was <u>lost</u>, and the copy I now have is dated 1872—and includes additional poems)
   </p>
   
   <p>You will know of John Ruskin,—'Professor Ruskin'. He is indeed a Master,
      
      
      
      and a Man eminently Just and Brave. He is an inspired Man, and his utterances are
      always classical, and mostly divine. A few days ago I sent a few extracts of your
      poems to him, and—though he was ill—he at once answered as follows:—
   </p>

      <br></br><br></br>'Dear Riley
      
   </p>
   <br><br><span class="indent">These are quite glorious things you have sent me.<sup><a href="#loc.03351_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Who <u>is</u> Walt (Walter?) Whitman, and is much of him like this!</span><br><br>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Ever gratefully yours
      
      <br></br>J Ruskin'
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Please know that Ruskin is esteemed as the greatest critic
      
      
      
      of scripture, sculpture, and painting that we have any knowledge of, and that he is
      extremely careful not to use adjectives unsuitably. He writes 'glorious', and, by
      that, means <u>really</u> the utmost degree of excellence. I never knew him use the word before, except as
      describing some scenery or valorous action. It is <u>very seldom indeed</u> that he has used the word—though his 'works' are so many that a complete set costs
      about £120. The book and photograph I wish to forward to Ruskin. The money cost shall
      be remitted—by or for him. He will be greatly pleased
      
      
      
      to receive (and thank you for) your kind acquiescence to this request.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As for <u>myself</u>—since I read your book I have been striving to work as a good Pupil and Companion.
      You have sent me through poverty and many cruel tribulations, but I have never whined
      over my work. I joined the 'International' and published and 
      
      
      
      edited the only paper it has had in England. I stuck to it, while I had 'a shot in
      the locker' and never once was tempted to utter a cowardly, sneaking, or treacherous
      word. Out of the strife, through the poverty, and despite the offers of bribes, and
      attempts to intimidate I came out clean handed and clean hearted—always supported
      by your great teachings.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>My dear Master—<u>do</u> write to me—your faithful pupil and lover. My <u>words</u> will not prove my love, but could you have seen my <u>work</u> since I first read your divine Message—you would <u>know</u> I loved you, and that you had gained one more loving soldier for your campaign.
