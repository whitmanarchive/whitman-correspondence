   <p>Please find herewith a check for $31:50, which I suppose is the am't of your bill

   <p>Please put up 40 copies in good substantial wrapping envelope, &amp; send me by express.
      Direct <em>Walt Whitman, Attorney Gen's Office, Treasury Building, Washington, D. C.</em>—Please keep the remaining 50 copies till I send some order about them.

   <p>You have overlooked one thing. When I called upon you 2d January,<sup><a href="#med.00401_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> we found a discrepancy in the two lists of sheets on hand—yours had it that Sheet
      B, 2d consisted of only 225 sheets—while my list had it that Sheet B 2d consisted
      of 325 sheets—I wish you to carefully count sheet B 2d &amp; inform me how many there
      are—as it will decide how many of the deficient signatures of "Drum-Taps" etc.,<sup><a href="#med.00401_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> I will require to finish up the edition. Please acknowledge the reception of this,
      with check.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00401_n1">1. This draft letter is
      endorsed, "Sent Anderson &amp; Archer | Feb. 19, 1868." When Emory Holloway made
      his transcription in 1920, the manuscript draft was in the Henry Goldsmith
      Collection.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00401_n2">2. This letter is not
      known.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00401_n3">3. In his  letter to Michael Doolady,
      Whitman had initially presumed that Anderson and Archer had prepared 100
      copies.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00401_n4">4. This reference to
      visiting Anderson and Archer, who had offices in New York, on January 2, 1868,
      is somewhat puzzling; there is no other evidence that Whitman was in New York at
      this time. He was in Washington on December 30, 1867, and on January 17, 1868;
      see his letters of  and .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00401_n5">5. The 1867 edition appeared in
      many forms: <em>Leaves of Grass</em> by itself, with <em>Drum-Taps</em>, and with <em>Songs Before
         Parting</em>.<a href="#r5">[back]
