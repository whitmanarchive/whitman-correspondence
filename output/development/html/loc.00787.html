      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>You spoke the other day, partly in fun, about the men being so undemonstrative. I
      thought I would write you a line, as I hear you leave the hospital tomorrow for a
      few weeks. Your labor of love &amp; disinterestedness here in Hospital is appreciated.
      I have invariably heard the Ward A patients speak of you with gratitude, sometimes
      with enthusiasm. They have their own ways (not outside eclat, but in manly American
      hearts, however rude, however undemonstrative to you). I thought it would be sweet
      to your tender &amp; womanly heart, to know what I have so often heard from the soldiers
      about you, as I sat by their sick cots. I too have learnt to love you, seeing your
      tender heart, &amp; your goodness to those wounded &amp; dying young menâ€”for they have grown
      to seem to me as my sons or dear young brothers.
   </p>
   
   <p>As I am poor I cannot make you a present, but I write you this note, dear girl, knowing
      you will receive it in the same candor &amp; good faith it is written.
   </p>
