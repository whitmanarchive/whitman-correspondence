      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send by same mail with this, my latest piece, copied in a newspaper<sup><a href="#upa.00013_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—&amp; will write you just a line or two. I suppose you duly received my former letters
      (two)—I ought to have written something about your children (described to me in your
      letter of last summer, July 23d, which I have just been reading again)—Dear boys &amp;
      girls—how my heart goes out to them<sup><a href="#upa.00013_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Did I tell you that I had received letters from Tennyson, &amp; that he cordially invites
      me to visit him? Sometimes I dream of journeying to Old England, on such visit—&amp; then
      of seeing you &amp; your children—but it is a dream only.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still living here in employment in a Government office—My health is good—Life
      is rather sluggish here—though not without the sunshine—(Your letters too were warm,
      bright rays of it)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am going on to New York soon to remain there a few weeks<sup><a href="#upa.00013_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>—but my address will still be here—I wrote lately to Mr. Rossetti quite a long letter<sup><a href="#upa.00013_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup>—My present address is Solicitor's Office, Treasury, Washington, D. C. U. S. America.
   </p>

      Best love &amp; remembrance to you, dear friend, &amp; to the young folk—

   <p id="upa.00013_n5">4. Edwin Haviland Miller
      suggests this timeline is a misstatement concerning Whitman's intended stay in
      Brooklyn, since, in his  letter to
      Rudolf Schmidt, Whitman wrote that he would remain in New York until April 10.
      Miller also points out that Whitman sent Schmidt an address in Brooklyn where he
      would be staying, while he provided Gilchrist only his address in
      Washington.<a href="#r4">[back]
