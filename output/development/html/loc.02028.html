      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:—
      
   </p>  
   
   <p>You will see by the enclosed card that I have returned to the Internal Revenue
      service. I regretted to leave Los Angeles and the practice of law, but times got
      very hard there, and although I had some important cases and good fees on prospect
      I
      was unable to realize the cash proceeds; so I applied and got my present portion—same
      that I held
      before.—I hope to resume practice in the state, some time in the future, when
      I have paid my debts and saved a little money.—I am now a citizen of
      California and hope to always remain such. I should not be contented to settle down
      in the East, again, I think.—
   </p>
   
   <p>The death of William O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> though long anticipated, was a
      great shock when the news came—What a wealth of intellectual enthusiasm and
      power was there extinguished. if it could be so: but I don't believe he or any of
      us
      can go out like a child's carlacue in the night.<sup><a href="#loc.02028_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> I have faith to believe that we shall all meet again on the other side of
      Jordan, &amp; if we can only have such good times as we had of yore in Washington I shall be
      content. My mother is still living in Boston at the age of 75, well and hearty.
      Thank God—I have not seen her for two years, and more.
   </p>
   
   <p>I read with much emotion in the Philadelphia &amp; Camden papers the account of your
      Seventieth Birthday dinner. I was especially touched by John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r4">4</a></sup> letter.—I am indebted to you for many papers—Always
      glad to get them.—[illegible] me
      until further notice simply Internal Revenue Agent. San Francisco. Cal. I hope you
      are fairly comfortable.—God bless you my old and long tried friend—"With
      fond affection and recollection.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02028_n2">1. Whitman sent this letter to two of his closest friends
      and admirers, the naturalist John Burroughs and Canadian physician and psychiatrist
      Richard Maurice Bucke,
      including it as an enclosure with his letter to Burroughs and Bucke of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.02028_n1">3. Eldridge is echoing Whitman's line in 
      "Song of Myself"—"I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt
      stick at night."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">4. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
