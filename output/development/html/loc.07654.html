   <p>I am about the same—Strangely somehow I don't get any more power in my body or
      legs—I feel pretty well—have written one or two pieces for the <em>Herald</em><sup><a href="#n4160" id="r2">2</a></sup>—&amp; they have printed as before—I have
      not left the room up stairs yet (now nine weeks)—the Doctor thinks it not best
      yet—
   </p>
   
   <p>My little booklet <em>November Boughs</em><sup><a href="#n3999" id="r3">3</a></sup> is ab't done—concludes
      with quite a long but very hurried &amp; scratchy paper on "Elias Hicks"<sup><a href="#n0301" id="r4">4</a></sup>—done
      mostly when I was sickest all, &amp; thought it best to hurry it done right
      off—But at present I am much as of late years, except my legs &amp; getting
      around even the room—wh' I sometimes fancy is not even coming back.

      5½—cool &amp; clear &amp; pleasant to-day—I am quite

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07654_n1">1. August 13 appears to be a
      plausible date. In his letter to Susan Stafford of  Whitman wrote: "It is raining all day like fury"; and here:
      "Rain'd like fury yesterday." Two pieces, "Over and Through the Burial Chant"
      and a prose "tribute to Sheridan," had recently appeared in the New York <em>Herald</em> (see Whitman's letter of  to Richard Maurice Bucke). Jessie, Thomas Jefferson
      ("Jeff") Whitman's daughter, was staying with Louisa in August: In his <em>Commonplace Book</em> Whitman noted that Louisa and Jessie
      placed Edward Whitman in the Insane Asylum at Blackwoodtown on August 1 (<em>The Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
      There is no extant letter, however, from Jeff, who wrote from Milwaukee on July
      14.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4160">2. Whitman contributed a series of
      poems and prose pieces to the <em>New York Herald</em> at the
      invitation of the editor, James Gordon Bennett, Jr. From December 1887 through
      August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems were published in the paper.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">3. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0301">4. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker from Long
      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his
      influence on Whitman, see David S. Reynolds, <em>Walt Whitman's
         America</em> (New York: Knopf, 1995), 37–39.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1055">5. Jessie Louisa Whitman was the
      second daughter of Jeff and Martha Whitman.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4995">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

         </a></p>
   <p id="n6113">7. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_92.html">Davis, Mary Oakes (1837 or 1838–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
