   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00382_n1">1. This postcard is addressed, "Pete
      Doyle, | M st. South bet 4½ &amp; 6th | Washington D. C." It is postmarked:
      "Camden | (?) | (?) 9 | N.J.; Carrier | 30 | Dec | 8 AM."<br><br>
      This postcard cannot be assigned to a specific year because the allusions to
      Whitman's health are vague and in fact applicable to almost any time between
      1873 and 1876, and there are no concrete references to events which would
      make dating possible. However, it was written on a standard government
      postcard which was redesigned in 1876.
