      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thank you very much for the "Two Rivulets," which came sparkling, and dancing, and
      babbling into my house this morning.<sup><a href="#tex.00358_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> I have long been acquainted with your writings,
      and have taken a great interest in them. I wish you had given me a line to say what
      you were doing, and how you were. I trust the world uses you fairly well, but I do
      not think it is a world that is much to boast about. Mr. Tennyson<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r2">2</a></sup> has been in London
      for the last six weeks, and now he has gone to his home in the Isle of Wight. I have
      often heard him speak of you, and about you, in a way that would be gratifying to
      you, as "Walt Whitman, the Poet," and "Walt Whitman, the man," and I like your
      portrait. It reminds me a little of that of Isaac Walton.<sup><a href="#n2007" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      I am, very sincerely yours,
      <br></br>Frederick Locker.

      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r2">[back]
