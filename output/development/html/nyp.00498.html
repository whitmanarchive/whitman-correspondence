   <p id="nyp.00498_n2">2. The letter referred to is
      not with the manuscript. Whitman wrote this note to O'Connor on the envelope of
      the letter, which, according to the postmark, was received in Camden on April
      27. On  O'Connor wrote: "I return your
      Salt Lake City letter about Bacon and Shakespeare, having carefully read it
      twice. It seems quite crazy—though maybe only crude—yet has some
      good points in it, which I took in" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 9 vols., 4:191).<a href="#r2">[back]
