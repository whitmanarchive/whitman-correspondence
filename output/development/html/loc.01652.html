      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.01652_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I want some things taken out of my trunk, &amp; put in a bundle &amp; sent here by express.
      
      I have written to-day to Mr. Eldridge &amp; sent him the key. I have asked him to go into
      Milburn's between 3½ and 4 this afternoon, &amp; meet you—or if not convenient for you,
      
      <u>this</u> afternoon, <u>to-morrow</u>, or <u>next</u> 
      will do just as well, as I am in no hurry—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—You both go up in my room &amp; get them—I want
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My <u>old gray suit</u>, coat vest &amp;, (I think there are two pair of pants)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My old <u>black overcoat</u> that is laid away in the trunk
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p><u>Black felt hat</u>—(the smallest lightest one)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The <u>old buckskin</u> gloves
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think some big sheets of very stout wrapping paper, &amp; plenty of some stout cord
      will do—the directions must be very plain, &amp; in two places—If not convenient 
      to go to day, go <u>to-morrow afternoon</u>, <u>or next</u>.
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>I <u>don't</u> want the freight paid, as I will pay it on delivery here. I enclose 
      a dollar, as there may be some expense—(some little fixings.) Pete, I rec'd
      your letter this morning, &amp; it was very welcome, as always. I rec'd the Sunday Herald too.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am having a <u>good</u> <u>spell</u> so far to-day—(if it would only continue)—The bundle will come well enough, as it
      is a short straight route, 
      if you only do it up so they wont get loose, &amp; put on <u>plain</u> <u>directions</u>.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
