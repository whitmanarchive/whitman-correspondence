      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>you who have put in words what I can but feebly put in thoughts, you I know will
      excuse the liberty I am taking in writing to you. Drawn to you irresistibly I write,
      satisfied to be in communion with you, even though only in thought and by letter,
      though ere long I hope to see you face to face, for He, my lover and comrade,
      lives in Delaware,
      and the force of love impels the one to the other. This, though, I have to ask, so
      ask at once, whether out of your comradeship you would send me one or two roots of
      Calamus, to be treasured by myself and comrades as dear memorials of the
      Master-comrade. I make bold to ask this favour, trusting to your Inscription "To
      You." I have made bold to speak to you, will you fulfil your promise and speak to
      me?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think of all your wondrous poems, the one that appeals most to me is "The base of
      all metaphysics," shewing, as it does, the grandeur of the conception of the divine
      Christian faith in universal love. I am an English Priest, but hope I do not come
      under your law, for priests <u>can</u> love democracy and
      mankind. I live among the people in the crowded buildings, I love them all and
      individual. May universal love soon spread it wings o'er Continents new &amp; old.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To thee I offer my affection, for that is all I can, but may we meet ere long. So
      long.
   </p>
