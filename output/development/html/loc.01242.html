      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Just a line as you have been much in my thoughts lately. The Scottish Art Review is
      publishing a review of November Boughs<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r1">1</a></sup> next month—by me—and I send you a
      slip.<sup><a href="#loc.01242_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> The winter keeps very mild here, but gloomy, and we don't see much of the sun.
      I suppose you find your strength waning very much, and don't reckon to be
      long with us now. Mr. Sharpe,<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r3">3</a></sup> my old harper friend that I told you of, died a few
      days ago—"very quiet &amp; gentle" says his son writing to me. I hope you have not
      much pain dear Walt; we shall miss you so much—but you will perhaps understand
      more about us than we about you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am in London for a week or two. A friend of
      yours, from Belfast, who does not give his name, wants to send the enclosed 22/6 to
      buy you some little thing, now you are ill. So you will accept it, won't you? Affectionate
      remembrances to Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r4">4</a></sup> if you see him.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      —and love to yourself as always
      <br></br>Edward Carpenter
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I saw Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> a day or two ago
   </p>
   
   <p>P.S. The Money Order is sent in <u>my</u> name.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
