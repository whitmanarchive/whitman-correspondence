   <p>I would advise you to write to Han somewhat of an advising letter;<sup><a href="#n0299" id="r1">1</a></sup> what her prospects might be with her brother George:<sup><a href="#n0700" id="r2">2</a></sup> she has recieved very kind letters from his wife, inviting her to visit them.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The trouble I have with her [
      <span class="unclear">is?</span>]
       past endurance: She invades my room, with such offensive [
      <span class="unclear">demeanoar?</span>]
       at times, that I am forced to quit my painting and take to the street: and then she
      assumes jealousy, and during my absence ransacks my papers, trunks and portfolios
      for scraps of poetry, composition of a date that have past my memory, and these she
      brings forward
      
      and reads to me, and berates me with, applying them to some one individual or other,
      at the present time, whichever comes into her head; like one possessed by a very devil.
      I am driven from my bed at midnight, and to the outside, in the piazza, where I sometimes
      sit, for hours. I cannot submit to it any longer. She smells my coat, when I come
      home, my gloves, my handkerchief and declares that I have been abed somewhere: Of
      course I can go to the hotel, and it would occasion no surprise; The neighbours have
      become so familiar with 
      
      Genl Henry, that they will have no communication [
      <span class="unclear">or?</span>]
       intercourse, with her. Half my time is passed in gardening, and portions [illegible] the rest waiting upon her, from the grocery. A evening she goes out, in the rain
      and darkness and returns at bed time, with scandal stories, of sexual demoralisation—whoring
      truly, and she does not take the smallest interest or thought of how I am to mantain myself, Keep this shelter over her and the sheriff from fore-closing—she shows nothing
      but the most uncompromising vagaries—I have lived like a dog—and can
      
      
      
      prove it. She allway did have some mean provoking uncalled for scandalous reflection.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am sorry to be compelled to give such a lamentable story. It would not appear well
      in print. She is identified with yourself [illegible] I shall do the best I can for her. I cannot afford to hire a studio away from the
      house—I have no support here scarcely—,
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am seriously thinking of returning to my former profession, in New York, but such
      circumstances [
      <span class="unclear">as?</span>]
       I have narrated could only so greatly discourage me. I enclose some papers that she
      has just raked up, to give you a fair idea of my grievances and her vagaries.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0299">1. Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a French-born
      landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman (1823–1890), Walt
      Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_96.html">Heyde, Charles Louis (1822–1892)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0700">2. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
