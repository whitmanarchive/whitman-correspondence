      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of June 14 just rec'd—also the corrected circulars. (Yours of the 16th, of the 25th, 
      of the 26th, &amp; of the 29th May, previously acknowledged)<sup><a href="#pri.00022_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> All gives me entire satisfaction &amp; comfort—arousing my deepest gratitude. 
      All here goes as well as could be expected—even better—except that the <u>new edition</u> 
      is rather slow in getting ready to be sent to subscribers, but will very soon be ready,
      &amp; all 
      the good friends &amp; subscribers will have their copies carefully sent to their addresses
      by mail 
      prepaid, (as I find this is the best way)—There were really only 100 of the first
      edition 
      printed 
      
      
      
      and they have become exhausted—that is the reason of some present delay—but, 
      as said in former letter, <u>every order &amp; purchase will be faithfully supplied</u> (only <u>let the address 
         of the friend be full &amp; plain, in every instance</u>, the same as they have been hitherto)—&amp; 
      all lagging copies—yours &amp; Mrs. G's among the rest—will also be carefully 
      sent in due time—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—The Two Vols. of the new edition, will be identically the same in every literary respect, text,
      pictures, 
      autograph &amp; photo. but a <u>different binding</u>,—(substantial, but less showy,—good strong, 
      half-calf, marble paper, leather tips, no gilt)—I am printing of this new ed. 600 L. of G. and 650<sup><a href="#pri.00022_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> <u>Two R</u>—They will soon be ready—I have notified you that Vols. have been forwarded 
      to &amp; rec'd, acknowledged by J. L. Warren, Reynell, (thank him for his kind generous note) W
      B. Scott,<sup><a href="#pri.00022_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> (him also) and to A. G. Dew Smith—also to Therese Simpson,<sup><a href="#pri.00022_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> of Edinburgh—also 
      
      
      
      Geo. Wallis,<sup><a href="#pri.00022_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Kensington Art Museum—(&amp; I believe one or two others)—I sent 2 copies <u>Memoranda of War</u> (one bound, one in sheets) to N. MacColl,<sup><a href="#pri.00022_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> <u>Athenaeum</u>, June 12. (Your special copy <u>Mem</u>. 
      of course was for <u>you</u> to keep, as your name was written in it by me.)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have not yet rec'd my pay for the little <u>Man-of-War-Bird</u> in <u>Athenaeum</u><sup><a href="#pri.00022_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> nor the prose piece on <u>the War</u> in the <u>Examiner</u>.<sup><a href="#pri.00022_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> If convenient the editors can send to me by p.o. money order, as I find that very
      straight &amp; sure.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Joaquin Miller comes occasionally to see me—his visits are pleasant to me—Did you
      get the <u>Pre-Raphaelite</u> 
      article in the <u>Galaxy</u> I sent?<sup><a href="#pri.00022_n10" id="r9">9</a></sup> Also J. M's letter to me about it?<sup><a href="#pri.00022_n11" id="r10">10</a></sup>—Longfellow has also been to see me—(a sort of one-horse visit)<sup><a href="#pri.00022_n12" id="r11">11</a></sup></p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Tennyson sent £5 at once to Buchanan (on the latter's letter) who sent it to me—I
      havn't written 
      lately to T.,<sup><a href="#pri.00022_n13" id="r12">12</a></sup> as I supposed him abroad on the continent—but I intend to write soon—&amp; 
      send him a set of my books—I am not at all sure that A. T. <u>sees my poems</u>—but <u><u>I do his</u></u>, &amp; strongly, 
      (&amp; there perhaps I have the advantage of him)—but I think <u><u>he sees me</u></u>—&amp; nothing could have 
      evidenced more courtesy, &amp; manliness, &amp; hospitality, than his letters to me have shown,
      for five years.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Buchanan has sent me six or seven names, (&amp; a cheque)—will all soon be supplied, 
      with the rest—Let me know if you find Ch. Kent<sup><a href="#pri.00022_n14" id="r13">13</a></sup>—Has the <u>Secularist</u><sup><a href="#pri.00022_n15" id="r14">14</a></sup> my address?—Middling well—very hot weather here—

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="pri.00022_n6">6. Wallis (1811–1891) was an artist and
      Keeper of the Art Collection at the South Kensington Museum from 1860 until his
      death. Whitman sent the two volumes to him on June 7 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="pri.00022_n7">7. Norman MacColl (1843–1904), the
      editor of the London <em>Athenaeum</em> from 1871 to 1900. Whitman
      noted sending the two books on June 12 (The Commonplace Book).<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="pri.00022_n8">8. An undated entry in Whitman's Commonplace
      Book recorded the receipt of £3.3 from <em>The Athenaeum</em>; see

   <p id="pri.00022_n13">12. If Whitman's recollection was correct,
      Longfellow came to Camden with George W. Childs, the owner of the Philadelphia
      <em>Public Ledger</em>, and, not finding him at home, finally
      encountered him at the wharf. Whitman was unimpressed with Longfellow (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996),
      1:129–130). The New York <em>Tribune</em> noted the visit on
      June 3: "The two poets are said to bear a striking resemblance to each
      other."<a href="#r12">[back]

   <p id="pri.00022_n14">13. Whitman's last letter to Tennyson was

      lost.<a href="#r13">[back]
