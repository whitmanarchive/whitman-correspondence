   <p>Your post card of 22<u>d</u> came to hand this morning [.] I am
      glad you are able to say that you are "fairly well". Shall try to see the 4<u>th</u> vol. of Am. Sup. to Ency. Brit. I have the Ency. <u>itself</u> but not the supplement.<sup><a href="#syr.00044_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      Have spent an hour today most pleasantly looking over the drafts of "The Song of the
      Redwood Tree." Studying it all from the newspaper piece (which seems to have
      suggested it) to the finished, printed, poem. It is all most interesting and
      suggestive.<sup><a href="#syr.00044_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> [—] Still the same wonderfull
      weather here, warm—bright—sunny—. Willy Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      is here still will go East to work at meter probably early next week. The scheme at
      present is as follows: Gurd will go East and make a gas meter, then our New York
      partner will establish a company to manufacture—we hope to be making meters by
      the autumn but there may be other slips ahead of us yet and we count on nothing too
      certainly [/] We will just jog along and do our best and leave the rest to
      Providence. After all it is a matter of little consequence [/] we have done very
      well for a long time now without the meter and I guess we can get on all right
      without it still. One thing I would like to know (tho' I suppose I never shall) that
      is how Harned<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> accounts (to himself) for his failure to
      carry out his agreement with us?<sup><a href="#syr.00044_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I have sent copies of the Inspector's Annual Report (in which mine is printed) and
      shall send you one as soon as I get them
   </p>
   
   <p>All well and quiet here</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4284">4. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
