      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I arrived home [
      <span class="unclear">last night at?</span>]
       about 7 PM,<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r2">2</a></sup> [
      <span class="unclear">and I was feeling?</span>]
       bad and I [
      <span class="unclear">was going slow?</span>]
       but the horses did not like it much they wanted to troot all the way home, they felt good I guess, they have not been doing much for a couple
      of weeks or more, so they wanted to show off, you know how it is your self when you
      feel like <u>licking</u> me; but I held them down as I do you, when you feel that way. I have a kind of a
      cold from comeing up yesterday [illegible] 
      good other ways. Father is a little better today than he was yesterday, but he looks
      very badly yet. Debbie &amp; Joe got home about 9. OK., they were over to Philadelphia
      after they left [illegible] over to [illegible] Swartse's, [illegible] from what I hear them say. Ed and I went over to Glendale to church Sunday ev., they had <u>distracted</u> meeting (as I call) it over there, there was 3 up seeking there souls salvation. It looks as if the rain was not over with yet, and the "rooster"
      is crowing, (that is a sure sign) they say.
   </p>
   
   <p>When I saw you on Federal St., yesterday, I thought you did not look very well, what
      was the matter with you? did you not feel as well as usual? Ben is not collecting
      today and 
      
      it seems lonly here without him here. I don't have any one to talk too unless he is here, everything
      is as still as the dead of night, not a sound reaches my ear and the ticking of the
      clock appears to be almost [illegible] looking out of the [
      <span class="unclear">store window?</span>]
       over here. I wonder what his thoughts are about; there the click of the register
      has broken the stillness of the place, it seems like the presence of an old and loving
      friend, it is telling of the death of a man out in the st of Origan, I don't know to who: but here comes a fellow around now he sais put in a word for him he is <u>blaguarding</u> me, let him crack away, I will have to close.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04001_n1">1. The envelope for this letter
      is endorsed (by Whitman): Nov 27 '77.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0590">2. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>â€”though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
