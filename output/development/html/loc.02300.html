   <p>I have just received a copy of Baldwins Monthly
      containing your little paper on the indian delegations,<sup><a href="#loc.02300_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      for which many thanks.<sup><a href="#loc.02300_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup></p> 
   
   <p>In the third<sup><a href="#loc.02300_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> paragraph you say that there is something about the essential traits of
      our aborigines which "will almost certainly never be transmitted to the future." If
      I am so fortunate as to regain my health I hope to weaken the force of that  statement, at
      least in sofar as my talent &amp; training will permit. I intend to spend some years
      among them &amp; shall endeavor to perpetuate on canvas some of the finer types,
      both men &amp; women &amp; some of the characteristic features of their life. It
      will certainly be well worth the while. My artistic enthusiasm was never so
      thoroughly stirred up as by the indians They certainly have more of beauty dignity
      &amp; nobility mingled with their own wild individuality than any of the other
      indigenous types of man. Neither black nor Afgahn, Arab nor Malay (I know them all pretty
       well) can
      hold a candle to the Indian. All of the other aboriginal types seem to be more or
      less distorted from the model of perfect human form—as we know it—the
      Blacks, thin-hipped, with bulbous limbs, not well marked; the Arabs large jointed
      &amp;c. But I have seen many a young indian as perfect in form &amp; feature as a
      Greek statue—very different from a Greek statue of course but as satisfying
      to the artistic perceptions &amp; demand.
   </p>
   
   <p>And the worst, or perhaps the best of it all is that it will require an artist—and
      a good one—to record the real facts &amp; impressions. Ten thousand
      photographs would not have the value of one really finely felt painting. Color is
      all important. No one but an artist knows how much. An indian is only half an indian
      without the blue-black hair &amp; the brilliant eyes shining out of the wonderful
      dusky ochre &amp; rose complexion. Photo's are but for records at the best &amp; if the Lord
      permits I shall give people some thing better to remember the Navajos &amp;
      Apaches by. With renewed thanks for your kindness in sending me the article I
      remain,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02300_n2">1. "An Indian Bureau
      Reminiscence" was published by "Baldwin, the Clothier" in <em>Baldwin's Monthly</em>; it was printed in February, 1884, and was reprinted
      in <em>To-Day</em> in May, 1884.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02300_n3">2. In this paragraph, and
      elsewhere in the letter, portions have been crossed out, apparently by Whitman.
      The note pasted to the top would seem to indicate that Whitman intended to have
      the letter printed. He also numbered the pages, beginning with 100 on the
      pasted-on note, and adding 101, 102, and 103, respectively, at the top of each
      subsequent page of the letter.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02300_n4">3. This word has been corrected
      to "fourth" in Whitman's hand.<a href="#r3">[back]
