      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is a long time since I wrote to you<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r1">1</a></sup>—but I have heard a good deal about you
      from the Gilchrists<sup><a href="#n3001" id="r2">2</a></sup>—about your journey West and back again. I <u>am</u> glad you have seen it all, and are satisfied—and
      the great mountains of Colorado—did they not make your soul shout? I would like to see you
      and be with you for a little time—it would seem so restful. I wonder now
      whether you have good friends about you at Camden, and feel at peace, spite of
      illness. Do you sometimes feel really satisfied, and as if you didn't care what
      happened, knowing it is done and can never be undone—dear Walt I wish you
      could live and renew your strength again in all those whom you have delivered. But perhaps you
      do so. I have long had it on my mind to write and ask you about the possibility of
      publishing a cheaper edition of 
      yr
      
       Leaves of Grass in England;—there are so many now who cannot afford
      the long price of present editions. I have thought that the sale might be so
      increased by a cheaper edition (say a 7/6 one) as even to pay you. But then
      there is the difficulty of publishers (Trübner 
      wd
      
       I think do you justice); and of course you could not issue your present
      stereotyped 
      edn
      
       in England at a lower price than in America. Still, what if a few friends
      in England combined to undertake the expense of a comparatively cheap edition, sell
      it through Trübner or some other publisher, and the profits to go to you. Would
      you approve? I have thought a good deal about it, and that is the only feasible plan
      
      wh
      
       occurs to me—that will make the book accessible to the people, and
      also pay you. But then again, would such a cheaper 
      edn
      
       be pirated across the Atlantic &amp; sold in the U.S.A in competition with
      yours? Of course you have thought all this over: but you may not realise, what I am
      only beginning to realise, the great demand 
      wh
      
       is likely to arise here for your works, <u>not</u> among the literary
      world but among the ordinary working day world. I have often been asked lately about
      cheaper editions—
   </p>
   <p>A friend of mine, a carpenter, writes "I need not tell you not to
      forget 'Leaves of Grass' 
      wh
      
       I have no doubt will please me as much as did 
      'Dem
      
       Vistas'. If I had sent you the references I made (and I made them to send
      to you) you would have been amused for I had marked almost every page and almost
      every paragraph. I considered it would be better to praise the whole book, for it
      is
      all excellent. It is to be hoped Whitman will publish a cheaper edition of his
      splendid works. He is one of those whom mankind in the future will surely
      know better than now how to 
      honour." I believe I once mentioned to you a Mrs Hardy who is now out in 
      Penna
      
       (Lawrence Co). If she ever comes to find you
      out—you will receive her. But I will not quote what she says of you—and
      yet I think I will—she says "I have not felt it a 'new birth of the soul'
      [
      <span class="unclear">merely?</span>]
      , I felt
      that his poems were the food for which my poor weak soul was longing. Oh I do love him, the
      dear earnest old man,
      I want so much to see him to take him by the [
      <span class="unclear">left?</span>]
       hand and standing palm to palm
      look away up into his
      blue eyes and say 'Walt Whitman I love you'. There are only a very few men I know
      to
      whom I could say it, but he I know would be able to understand <u>all</u> I mean by it; and it 
      wd
      
       do us both good—in no other way could I tell him how much I admire his
      poems".
   </p>
   
   
   <p>About myself, I feel that I cannot go on with this lecturing—and in a month I hope
      to be at work out in the country near here—at first on some land of
      Ruskins<sup><a href="#n3013" id="r3">3</a></sup>—but perhaps not for very long so. When you see Harry Stafford<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r4">4</a></sup> give him
      my love and say I am going to send him a photo: and hope he will send me one.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Goodbye, dear friend whom I do not ever forget. I wish I could be near you,
      in body, as I am in soul

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0141b">1. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3001">2. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885), widow to Alexander Gilchrist, and her four children Beatrice,
      Grace, Percy and Herbert. Anne Gilchrist wrote one of the first significant
      pieces of criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's
      Estimate of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M.
      Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59.
      Gilchrist's long correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in
      love with the poet after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she
      visited Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. Anne's son Herbert (1857–1914) was
      a painter and shared his mother's fascination for Whitman. For more on Whitman
      and the Gilchrists, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3013">3. John Ruskin (1819–1900) was
      one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
      via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
      of ). Ruskin, according to Whitman,
      expressed "<em>worry</em> [...] that [<em>Leaves</em> is] <em>too personal</em>, too emotional,
      launched from the fires of [...] spinal passions, joys, yearnings" (see the
      letter from Whitman to William O'Connor of ). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my
      Ruskin with some qualifications." Still, Ruskin "is not to be made little of: is
      of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.4.html">Thursday, January 24, 1889</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0590">4. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
