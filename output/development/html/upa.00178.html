   </p>
   
   
   <p>I kept staying &amp; staying in N Y (four weeks altogether)—but took the 4 p m train yesterday
      &amp; had a fine run to Philadelphia—So here I am to-day in my regular den—find a great accumulation of letters—all those of the past month—so
      you will understand several things (my not sending regards &amp; love to Miss Hillard
      for instance)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing new to write about—brother &amp; sister well as usual—fearfully hot weather still,
      but I stand it fairly yet—I have rec'd a letter from Rossetti, a scrap from which I enclose<sup><a href="#upa.00178_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I think of going down to White Horse Saturday<sup><a href="#upa.00178_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—No letter from Bee yet—I suppose you rec'd the Tribune of July 4 with my printed letter in.<sup><a href="#upa.00178_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>

      Best love to you &amp; all—
