   <p>Your kind letter came duly to hand. I have been delaying to write you about the portrait<sup><a href="#yal.00400_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> in answer—wanting <em>you</em> to do it—&amp; wanting, if I could arrange it, to give you the full price—I will not
      have the job done by any second-rater, &amp; have concluded to give it up for the present—unless
      it could be done by you for $50, which, I am fully aware, would not be your due engagement.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I return to Washington in ten or twelve days. Is there any chance of your coming on
      there?

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00400_n1">1. William J. Linton
      (1812–1897), a British-born wood engraver, came to the United States in
      1866 and settled near New Haven, Connecticut. He illustrated the works of John
      Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, and
      others, wrote the "indispensable" <em>History of Wood-Engraving in
         America</em> (1882), and edited <em>Poetry of America,
         1776–1876</em> (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Whitman's
      poems as well as his picture. According to his <em>Threescore and
         Ten Years, 1820 to 1890—Recollections</em> (1894), 216–217,
      Linton met with Whitman in Washington and later visited him in Camden (which
      Whitman reported in his , letter
      to Peter Doyle): "I liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big
      fellow, . . . a true poet who could not write poetry, much of 
      wilfulness
      
       accounting for his neglect of form." <a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00400_n2">2. Linton's engraving
      appeared in the 1876 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and in
      <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888–1889); it
      inspired the poem "Out from Behind This Mask." See Harold W. Blodgett, "Whitman
      and the Linton Portrait," <em>Walt Whitman Newsletter</em>, 4
      (September 1958), 90–92.<a href="#r2">[back]
