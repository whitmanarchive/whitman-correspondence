      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have seen reports that you were not so well just now, as we all hoped you'd be at
      opening of Spring. Let me send as a Spring message (as I sent a year ago) I find
      every where a growing respect and even tenderness for you. I have spoken several
      times during the year upon your work and have made converts always. The mere reading
      from some of your pages serving to open the eyes of my hearers. I am perfectly
      certain that this will be my spring message as long as you stay here with
      us.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As for myself</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>I am hard at work and beginning to succeed with the <u>Century</u>, <u>Harpers</u>, <u>Arena</u>
      etc.<sup><a href="#loc.02135_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I am still too poor to do what I'd like in the
      way of having a copy of each edition of your works. I hope to be able to do soon.
      Please give my regards to Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r3">3</a></sup> and other friends. Ask him to
      send me a line if you do not feel like writing.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Hamlin Garland
      (1860–1940) was an American novelist and autobiographer, known especially
      for his works about the hardships of farm life in the American Midwest. For his
      relationship to Whitman, see Thomas K. Dean, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_190.html">Garland, Hamlin</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02135_n1">1. A note in the upper-left of
      the addressed side of the envelope reads: "see | notes | Nov. 8, '90." This
      letter is addressed: Walt Whitman | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked:
      Roxbury Sta. | Apr | 15 | 3PM | 1890 | Mass.; Cam(?) | (?) | 9 AM | 1890 |
      Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.02135_n2">2. Garland published two
      stories in <em>Harper's Weekly</em> in 1889: "Under the Lion's
      Paw" ([7 September], 726-727) and "Old Sid's Christmas" ([28 December],
      1038-1040). "Drifting Crane" would appear in the 31 May 1890 issue of <em>Harper's</em> (421-422); "Among the Corn-Rows" would appear in
      the June 28 issue (506-508). Also in 1890, Garland published two pieces in <em>Arena</em>: the critical essay "Ibsen as a Dramatist" (June,
      72-82) and the short story "The Return of a Private" (December, 97-113).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
