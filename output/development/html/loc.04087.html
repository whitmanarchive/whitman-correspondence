   <p>I send enclosed a proof of an engraving by Closson<sup><a href="#loc.04087_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> from Innes's beautiful
      painting—"The Shadow of Death."<sup><a href="#loc.04087_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I send it on the chance that it may meet some
      spontaneous current of poetic movement in you. If it does will you let the movement
      have its course &amp; let us have
      
      
      
      the result in the shape of a poem which we may print in our magazine?<sup><a href="#loc.04087_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> We intend using
      the illustration as a frontispiece. If you find no <u>motif</u>
      in the picture, please return the proof to us.
   </p>
