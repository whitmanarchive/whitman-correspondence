   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="dbw.00001_n2">1. Lozynsky claims that Whitman
      wrote this note to Bucke on October 17, 1879, but in his letter to his wife
      Bucke wrote that he had received the post card from Whitman on Friday. October
      17 fell on a Friday in 1879, so Whitman must have written and mailed this letter
      at least a day earlier.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="dbw.00001_n1">2. The letter from Bucke to
      Whitman of 22 September 1879 appears to be lost. An account of Whitman's Western
      trip and his physical collapse appears in Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller (New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–1977), 3:163–171. The poet remained in St.
      Louis at the home of his brother Jeff until January 3, 1880. On January 7, 1880,
      he sent ten volumes to Dr. Bucke (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
