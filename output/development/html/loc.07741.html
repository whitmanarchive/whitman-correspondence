   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07741_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. |
      Dec 26(?) | 8 PM | 89.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03012_n1">2. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0615">3. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07741_n2">4. Symonds' letter of  was indeed "passionate": "I cannot even
      attempt to tell yourself (upon this page of paper with this pen in my hand),
      what it is that makes me ask you now to bless me. . . . Perhaps we shall yet
      meet [after death]: . . . I shall ask you about things which have perplexed me
      here—to which I think you alone could have given me an acceptable answer.
      . . . I cannot find words better fitted to express the penetrative fate with
      which you have entered into me, my reliance on you, &amp; my hope that you will
      not disapprove of my conduct in the last resort." What Whitman failed to see was
      that Symonds, who was preoccupied with his study of sexual inversion, was trying
      to ask the questions he finally posed nine months later. See Whitman's 19 August
      1890 letter to Symonds.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.07741_n3">5. Almost the same
      information appeared in the Camden <em>Post</em> on December 26 in
      a paragraph probably written by Whitman: "He resolutely passed by all the show
      parts and lawns, and chose a place back on a woody side hill, . . . where a
      solid gray stone monumental vault will be constructed" (<em>The
         Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839-1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07741_n4">6. <em>The
         Critic</em> of December 21 contained an extract from Harrison S. Morris's
      article in <em>The American</em> entitled "Whitman's
      'Indescribable Masculinity,'" a review of Sarrazin's book by his American
      translator.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="syr.00024_n3">7. Thomas Donaldson
      (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
      introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
      the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
      carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt
         Whitman, the Man</em> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see
      Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_111.html">Donaldson, Thomas (1843–1898)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
