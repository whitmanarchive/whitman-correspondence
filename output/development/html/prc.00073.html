      <br></br><br></br>Dear Hank
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of yesterday 
      rec'd
      
       this afternoon, &amp; glad to hear from you &amp; the
      folks—I hear from you now &amp; then by Hoag<sup><a href="#prc.00073_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> or
      Burr, who tell me they meet you up here frequently—(I wish you had said how
      Hieneken is getting along—is he getting better?)
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, Hank, my Boston tramp, lecture, &amp;c. turned out far ahead of what I had any
      idea of—it was not a very large room, but it was packed full (at $1 a head)
      &amp; they say there never was a more <em>high toned crowd</em>
      collected in the town—full half were ladies, &amp; I never saw finer
      ones—I had good quarters at the principal hotel, the Revere House,
      (dead-headed, the proprietor, Mr Ferrin invited me to stay as long as I
      liked)—&amp; callers all the time—So, boy, you see how your uncle was
      <em>set up</em>—&amp; yet I am going to speak to all my old
      friends just the same! !
   </p>
   
   <p>Have had several little jobs writing lately—Phila:
       and N. Y. papers<sup><a href="#prc.00073_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—(will send you the <em>Critic</em>
      of the latter city next Monday or Tuesday with my piece in)—Havn't
       felt very
      well lately—a real bad spell last night &amp; this forenoon—don't feel
      right living in the city any how, after the summer comes on—very possibly
      shall go off to Canada again, as Dr and Mrs B[ucke] wish me to, &amp; write
      strongly—
   </p>
   
   <p>I sent you a little book of poetry by a boy 13 years old, in Pennsylvania, he sent
      it
      to me with a nice letter<sup><a href="#prc.00073_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Well, Hank, my sheet is
      short &amp; most full, &amp; I must come to a close—I gather by your letter
      that you are in good spirits—love to you &amp; God bless you—I am sorry
      enough to hear your mother is unwell—Susan, my dear friend, I hope when this
      comes you will be all right—
   </p>

   <p>I suppose your mother got a letter &amp; some papers from Boston,<sup><a href="#prc.00073_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> as I sent them, &amp; of course supposed you would
      all read them—my best love to your mother &amp; father &amp; I want you to
      let them read this—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00073_n1">1. This letter was noted in
      Whitman's Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For Harry's
      letter to Whitman on , see Edwin Haviland
      Miller, "Introduction" (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York, New York University Press, 1961–1977], 3:1–9).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00073_n2">2. See the letter from
      Whitman to Harry Stafford of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00073_n3">3. Whitman sent on May 3
      "Bumble-Bees and Bird Music" to W. R. Balch of <em>The
         American</em> (Philadelphia), for which he received $20 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book). It appeared on May 14, and was later included in <em>Specimen Days</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall (New York: New York
      University Press, 1963), 263. The poet sent "My Picture-Gallery" to Balch on
      October 8, 1880, for which he received $5, and which appeared in <em>The American</em> on October 30. On May 27, 1881, he sent to
      the same newspaper "A Summer's Invocation" (later called "Thou Orb Aloft
      Full-Dazzling"), and received $12 from Balch. The poem was printed on June 14.
      Unless Whitman meant <em>The Critic</em>, it is not clear which
      "N. Y. papers" he referred to. The third installment of "How I Get Around at 60,
      and Take Notes" appeared on May 7.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00073_n4">4. On May 3 Whitman sent
      Harry "Newspaper ballads" (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r4">[back]
