   <p>Well, mother, it's over at last with dear Matty—I got a dispatch of her death 
      on the evening of the 19th—I suppose you have too, of course—It must have been 
      a relief from very great suffering, as Jeff's letters of late described it—
      poor dear sister, she has many <em>real mourners</em>—I have just written to Han about it—
      I am about the same—rather better<sup><a href="#nyp.00308_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00308_n1">1. On February 23, 1873,
      Jeff's daughter Mannahatta, almost thirteen years old, wrote to her
      grandmother about her mother's death: "when I got home from school the buggy
      was out side of the door and papa said he would take Mama out riding as it
      was such a pleasant day and Mama wanted to go so much. so papa lifted her
      out and put her in the buggy and then went to take the reins and while he
      [was] taking them Mama fell over in the buggy and when papa turned around he
      did not know what had happened so he lifted her in the house and just then I
      came home from school and found that Mama was dying but she seemed to know
      me though she could not speak. I felt so bad that I did not know what to do"
      (The Library of Congress).<br><br>
      Jeff on the following day wrote of Martha's death to his mother: "The
      circumstances attending her death are quite impressive. Over two weeks
      before it the Dr told me that I might expect her death at any
      moment—that her lungs were in immediate liability to rupture and that
      each breath she drew was a risk, that I must not leave her alone a moment.
      On Tuesday she seemed to feel a little more like her old self—though
      suffering much pain from the fact that the right lung had been pierced by
      the gathering and the air in breathing would gather between the ports and
      remain—her right side and breast were very much enlarged from this
      cause—the pain was intense from the cancer and a few days before her
      death the old spinal trouble came back to her—yet with all this, dear
      Mother, did she keep up to the last—not a murmur escaped her—she
      was cheerful to a degree and at noon of the day she died sat up in her chair
      and directed how my lunch should be prepared" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection).<a href="#r1">[back]
