      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is difficult to express the gratification I have felt in looking over the pages
      of
      the volume you so kindly sent me. These pages mirror a life, and the meaning of a
      life—rather should I say, not <u>a</u> life, but <u>life</u>, for the lines which fill them express, not
      particulars, but universals. On this account, future generations will not let die
      the contents of this book; and that I have it from him who wrote it is a peculiar
      pleasure to me. Believe me.
   </p>

      Most gratefully yours
      <br></br>D. G. Brinton
      To
      Walt Whitman.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Daniel Garrison Brinton
      (1837–1899) was an archaeologist, anarchist, ethnologist, surgeon, editor
      and professor at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Whitman admired
      "Dr. Brinton," who would later speak at the poet's funeral.
