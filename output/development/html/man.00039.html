   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you my political letter from the Post<sup><a href="#n1049" id="r1">1</a></sup>—

   <p>Tell me how you like it</p>
   
   <p>Johnson<sup><a href="#n0335" id="r2">2</a></sup> called here Sunday with your letter to his Boy.<sup><a href="#man.00039_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Now take a little
      advice from me.
      You are <u>wise</u> I know. I am <u>otherwise</u>. But it is Mrs <u>Johnson</u> who seems most
      hurt—&amp; she has been very kind to you—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now if I was Walt

      wd
      
       write to her &amp; say all the pleasant things I

      stop Johnsons

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1049">1. James Matlock Scovel began to
      practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War he was in the New Jersey
      legislature, and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned actively for Horace
      Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S. Treasury during Chester
      Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home
      for Sunday breakfast, as he did on December 2 and 9, 1877 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a description of
      these breakfasts, see <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed.
      William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel,
      see George R. Prowell's <em>The History of Camden County, New
         Jersey</em> (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0335">2. Among early friends at Camden was John R. Johnston
      (1826–1895), "the jolliest man I ever met, an artist, a great talker,"
      Whitman wrote in a , letter to
      Peter Doyle. Johnston was a portrait and landscape painter who for years
      maintained a studio in Philadelphia and lived at 434 Penn Street in Camden. See
      <em>The New-York Historical Society Dictionary of Artists in
         America, 1564–1860</em> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1957).
      Whitman was fond of Johnston's children, Ida and Jack (John Jr.).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="man.00039_n1">3. The letter is not extant and
      the circumstances surrounding the alleged insult to Johnston's son are unknown.
