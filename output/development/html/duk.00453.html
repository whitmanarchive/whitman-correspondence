   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0285">1. Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908),
      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0839">2. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r2">[back]
