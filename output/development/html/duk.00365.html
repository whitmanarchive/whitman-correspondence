      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I arrived here yesterday from the Hotel De Libby and if ever a poor devil was glad
      to get in a Christian Country it was me.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am perfectly well Mother although I am in the Hospital Buildings, and am not under
      Medical treatment. The reason that I am quartered here is that the Hotels and Boarding
      Houses in town are cramed full, &nbsp;I stay here for one dollar and a half a day while the Hotels charge three
      or four dollars and we are just as comfortable as I want to be. I drew 2 months pay
      to day and bought a new suit of clothes and now I feel something like a white man.
   </p>
   
   <p>I made an application this morning for a leave of absence for 30 days and I expect
      to be home in the course of 3 or 4 days.
   </p>
   
   <p>We left Danville on the 19th of this Month and stopped in Richmond untill the morning of the 22d. On our arrival at Richmond I found 2 boxes filled with Clothing
      and grub for me and the way we went into the eatables while we were in Libby was a
      caution.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother I am very anxious indeed to hear from you all and wish you get to write or
      Telagraph to me (as soon (as you get this) as possibly I may get it if you write before I leave
      here.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have lots of yarns to tell you Mother but will wait untill I get home as I cant do justice to the darn Rebs, in a letter.</p>
   
   <p>You cant imagine how I want to see you and Mattie and the children and all the rest.</p>

      <br></br>give my love to all
