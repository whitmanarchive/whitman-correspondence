   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="wwh.00022_n1">1. Walt Whitman mounted a
      newspaper clipping containing these lines from the conclusion of Longfellow's
      fourth sonnet in a group entitled "Three Friends of Mine." The second and third
      lines are run together, and should read: "Beneath this roof at midnight, in the
      days | That are no more, and shall no more return. . . ." The final line should
      read "cover up," not "gather up."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="wwh.00022_n2">2. On  Jeff wrote to his brother: "We are
      jogging along as best we may. . . . I find both for [Jessie] and myself there is
      nothing like the open air—the out doors. . . . It is pretty hard on Jess
      to leave her alone (with servants of course) in the house yet at times (for a
      short time) this does occur, and of course she gives way to her feelings, poor
      child, but I am doing my best to counteract it all I can do."<a href="#r2">[back]
