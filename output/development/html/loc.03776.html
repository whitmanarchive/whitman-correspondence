   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Abraham Simpson, while working for J. M.
      Bradstreet &amp; Son, had supervised the binding of <em>Drum-Taps</em> (see Walt Whitman's , letter to Peter Eckler). Simpson wrote on , that he was going into business for
      himself: "Hearing you are writing another book, [I] would like to print and
      publish it for you and will give you better advantages than any other publishing
      house. . . . One of my reasons for securing your friendship is my appreciation
      for you as a man, with knowing your life has been devoted to help among those
      most in need of your assistance." On ,
      Simpson informed Walt Whitman that "we have established a Ptg &amp; Publishing
      House." But, in his , letter, he
      advised Walt Whitman that after consultation "with several eminent literary men,
      . . . though we are favorably impressed, . . . we deem it injudicious to commit
      ourselves to its publication at the present time."
