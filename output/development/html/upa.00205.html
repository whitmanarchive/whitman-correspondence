   <p>Down here again spending a few days—nothing very different—pretty much
      the same story of all my letters—but I knew you would like to hear—Mrs
      S[tafford] and all the family well as usual—they often speak of you &amp; of
      the old times—I was over to the creek and by the old walnut-trees last
      week—all beautiful &amp; refreshing as ever—
   </p>
   
   <p>Harry is still at Clementon—Mont is with B. S. at Kirkwood station—Ed has
      gone up to 
      Phila:
      
       to-day for store goods—Do you know of David Bogue,<sup><a href="#upa.00205_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> bookseller, Trafalgar 
      Sq:
      
       who publishes my book in
      London? Have you ever been in his place? I go up to Camden this evening—Yours
      of last
