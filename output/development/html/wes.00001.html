      slips of some of the newer pieces—the Volume is

      there—I have been away all summer—just 
      ret'd
      
       to Camden—I am well
      as usual of late for me—H[arry] S[tafford] is well, he is still
      telegraphing—Write me soon as you get this—How about our dear friends
      the G[ilchrist]s?
