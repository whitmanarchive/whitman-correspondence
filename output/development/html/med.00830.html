      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman, Dear Sir—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad to see by the Pall Mall Budget of yesterday that you are in fairly good
      health. Were I near you I should like to have the honor of paying my personal
      respects to you. I am your debtor. When a young man I read your Leaves of Grass 1855
      edition. It revealed a new world to me—the world within myself. Your Specimen
      Days<sup><a href="#n4121" id="r1">1</a></sup> I regard as the most humane book of the present century.
   </p>
   
   <p>While breathing the spirit of freedom it bears no feeling of ill will against those
      who wished to keep chains on men because their skins were black.
   </p>
   
   <p>I might say more, but enough to satisfy you that I have a real sympathy with your
      life's work, and that I regard your Leaves of Grass as being the most original of
      American books.
   </p>
   
   <p>If you would write your name upon my 1855 edition, which I intend to present to a
      public library, I should send it to you. I should like the book to represent your
      penmanship as well as your skill as a printer. Hoping you will be willing to render
      me this service, I am, dear Poet, yours truly,
   </p>

      Philadelphia firm of Rees Welsh and Company in 1882. The second issue was
      published by David McKay. Many of the autobiographical notes, sketches, and
      essays that focus on the poet's life during and beyond the Civil War had been
      previously published in periodicals or in <em>Memoranda During the
         War</em> (1875–1876).
