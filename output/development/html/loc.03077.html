      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thank you very much for yr flattering suggestion anent writing on the Dutch [
      <span class="unclear">outflashings?</span>]
       &amp;c. I sh-
      be glad of the points fr you any time, &amp; think they wd be the only part of value.
      But I agree with you as to letting one's thought drop mellow from the bough of the
      wind; &amp; I must say that I have as yet but vague=shimmering ideas or
      sense=perceptions as to WW.'s Dutch aspects. But I shall look up Motley &amp;
      Manahattan &amp;c, when I can, &amp; perhaps something of value may emerge.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Logan Smith<sup><a href="#n6122" id="r1">1</a></sup> is a good fellow.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Don't see Baxter<sup><a href="#n6000" id="r2">2</a></sup> somehow. He is a very secretive mystifying
      man,—is good Baxy.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The women are irrupting into journalism &amp; crowding out the men here in
      Boston.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>It seems nice to think of that good comb=honey of your'n. I have put up in glass
      60 jars of currants &amp; huckleberries &amp; have bought today 24 cans of Golden
      Gate peaches (the best —delicious). I <u>must have</u>
      fruit, or I suffer much.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is raining this evening—a good aeonian drench—dreamy &amp; misty &amp;
      dim—we have a sweet young girl<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r3">3</a></sup> visiting us, fresh &amp; pure &amp; happy.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was quite amused to see my letter about the G.A.R. in the Camden paper<sup><a href="#loc.03077_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup>—not
      amused I mean but willing. I never wrote anything, as Ruskin<sup><a href="#n3013" id="r5">5</a></sup> says, that all the
      world are not welcome to read.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I tho't the most profound and suggestive thought on yr recent article was that about
      the need of a reconstruction of our ideas of beauty.<sup><a href="#loc.03077_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> I shall ponder that.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I find they have Symonds's<sup><a href="#n0615" id="r7">7</a></sup> new vol.<sup><a href="#loc.03077_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      at the Athenaeum now, &amp; I am going to watch for it every day until I get it,
      tho' mind you, I dont expect to be anything but dissatisfied and supercilious over
      it.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n6122">1. Logan Pearsall Smith
      (1865–1946) was an essayist and literary critic. He was the son of Robert
      Pearsall Smith, a minister and writer who befriended Whitman, and he was the
      brother of Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, one of Whitman's most avid followers.
      For more information on Logan, see Christina Davey "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_106.html">Smith, Logan Pearsall (1865–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6000">2. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.03077_n1">4. Kennedy described the Grand
      Army of the Republic (G.A.R.) convention on  and evidently sent a clipping from the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently, Whitman sent the letter to a Camden
      newspaper.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3013">5. John Ruskin (1819–1900) was
      one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
      via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
      of ). Ruskin, according to Whitman,
      expressed "<em>worry</em> [...] that [<em>Leaves</em> is] <em>too personal</em>, too emotional,
      launched from the fires of [...] spinal passions, joys, yearnings" (see the
      letter from Whitman to William O'Connor of ). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my
      Ruskin with some qualifications." Still, Ruskin "is not to be made little of: is
      of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.4.html">Thursday, January 24, 1889</a>).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03077_n2">6. Kennedy is responding to "An
      Old Man's Rejoinder," which appeared in <em>The Critic</em> 17 (16
      August 1890): 85-86. The "Rejoinder" was later reprinted in <em>Good-Bye My Fancy</em> (1891) (see <em>Prose Works</em> 2:
      655-658). Near the end of the essay, Whitman writes: "My own opinion has long
      been, that for New World service our ideas of beauty (inherited from the Greeks,
      and so on to Shakspere—<em>query</em>—perverted from
      them?) need to be radically changed, and made anew for to-day's purposes and
      finer standards" (<em>PW</em> 2:658).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n0615">7. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
