      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman: 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have had it in my mind, concerning Leaves of Grass, to tell you a tale which will
      perhaps afford you a quiet moment's amusement now while you are preparing Autumn
      Boughs<sup><a href="#loc.02098_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> for us.
   </p>
   
   <p>Many years ago, probably about 1871, when the first enthusiasm for your wonderful
      book was on me;—the first &amp; last enthusiasm, I should say, for it has
      endured uninterruptedly,—I was at the home of George Hry. Lewes &amp;<sup><a href="#loc.02178_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> "George
      Eliot,"<sup><a href="#n3044" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; was enjoying one of those short earnest
      tête-a-tête's that she found means to accord somehow to each of her room
      full of visitors.
   </p>
   
   <p>I asked her what she thought of L. of G.; &amp; Lewes, coming up at the moment,
      remarked in his flippant way, "Let me see, the author wrote Heel-taps, didn't he?"
      Letting this poor jest pass, I pursued the serious talk with G. E.—found she
      knew hardly anything of L. of G., &amp; urged her to read it. She said she had
      glanced at it but was impressed that it had "no message for her soul". I ventured
      a
      respectful demurrer &amp; made way for the next tête-a-tête-ist. A few
      weeks afterwards, she sent me by young Lewes, who was then an official colleague of
      mine, a handsome and characteristic message. She had been <u>reading</u> Leaves of Grass;
      had found that the book <u>had</u> a "message for her soul" &amp;
      thanked me for the part I had taken in pressing on her attention its scope, meaning,
      and original force. I do not pretend to quote her words except those in inverted
      commas. The rest were only reported to me by a tolerably [
      <span class="unclear">inaccurate?</span>]
       young man; but the drift was
      certainly as given above.
   </p>
   
   <p>Now I have often thought she must have made some such acknowledgment to you
      direct—seldom as she wrote to anyone in those "Priory" days. Did she or did
      she not?
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Always, dear Walt Whitman
      <br></br>most sincerely yours,
      <br></br>H. Buxton Forman.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Henry Buxton Forman (1842–1917) was most
      notably the biographer and editor of Percy Shelley and John Keats. On , Buxton sent a copy of R. H.
      Horne's <em>The Great Peace-Maker; A Sub-marine Dialogue</em>
      (London, 1872) to Whitman. This poetic account of the laying of the Atlantic
      cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death, Forman's reputation
      declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham Pollard and John Carter
      published <em>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth
         Century Pamphlets</em>, which exposed Forman as a forger of many first
      "private" editions of poetry.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02098_n1">1. Forman is referring to
      Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em>. The book was published in
      October 1888 by Philadelphia publisher David McKay. For more information on the
      book, see James E. Barcus Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02178_n4">2. George Henry Lewes
      (1817–1878) was an English critic and philosopher. He was the partner of
      George Eliot.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3044">3. "George Eliot" was the pen name of
      Mary Ann Evans (1819–1880), one of the most influential British writers of
      the nineteenth century. Her works include <em>The Mill on the
         Floss</em> (1860), <em>Middlemarch</em> (1871–1872), and
      <em>Daniel Deronda</em> (1876). Whitman was especially
      enamored by Eliot's essay writing: "She is profound, masterful: her analysis is
      perfect: she chases her game without tremor to the very limit of its endurance"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.109.html">Wednesday, October 31, 1888</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
