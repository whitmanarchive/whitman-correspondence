   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel, was Horace Traubel's
      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0862">2. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
