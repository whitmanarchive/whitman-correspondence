   <p>Card came this morning. Letter you speak of must have been destroyed, as I have 
      rec'd none—Rec'd letter from P[eter] D[oyle] this morning. Am still getting along favorably considering
      all things—Heard from J[ohn] B[urroughs] last week—all well. Had a letter from Dr.
      Drinkard—

      This postcard bears the address, "Mrs. E. M. O'Connor | 1015 O st. near 11th
      N.W. | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Jan | 11 | N.J.;
      Carrier | 12 | Jan | 3 (?) PM."<br><br>
      Since Ellen O'Connor's letters to Whitman during this period are not extant,
      the year must remain conjectural. Certain facts point to 1875: the postcard
      Whitman used was discontinued early in 1876, and Burroughs visited Whitman
      at Camden about the middle of January in 1876.<a href="#r1">[back]
