      This letter's envelope bears the address, "Mrs Ellen M O'Connor | 1015 O
      street n w | Washington | D.C.." It is postmarked: "Camden | Nov | 23 |
      N.J."<br><br>
      Although the text furnishes no clues as to the date, 1876 appears plausible.
      Whitman apparently did not correspond with Ellen O'Connor between 1876 and
      1887; there are no extant letters from her to Whitman between 1865 and 1888.
      Because of the continued estrangement between Whitman and William O'Connor,
      probably neither his wife nor the poet was completely at ease in writing to
      the other.<a href="#r1">[back]
