      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I delivered the book to Mr. Reid<sup><a href="#loc.02347_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> for the "Tribune"—and had some considerable talk
      with him about a review article. I was afraid of Ripley but Reid confirmed my
      impression that Greeley<sup><a href="#n0276" id="r2">2</a></sup> is or has been favorable, and he agreed to speak to Greeley,
      and see what could be done in the premises.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—The conversation was exhaustive—that is to say I exhausted the powers I for the time
      being possessed—and the upshot was the rather limited result above mentioned. In any
      event, if the matter goes to Ripley, it will have gone to him by a friendly
      line.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I read the "Vistas"—not in the morning but at night There are many good and striking
      ideas, with plenty of opportunity for difference of opinion and criticism.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Swinton (1829–1901), a journalist and
      friend of Karl Marx, became acquainted with Whitman during the Civil War.
      Swinton, managing editor of the <em>New York Times</em>,
      frequented Pfaff's, where he probably met Whitman. Whitman's correspondence with
      Swinton began on . Swinton's
      enthusiasm for Whitman was unbounded. On , Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly impressed with the great
      humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you. I read this afternoon in
      the book. I read its first division which I never before read. I could convey no
      idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more to me than all other books and
      poetry." On , Swinton wrote what
      the poet termed "almost like a love letter": "It was perhaps the very day of the
      publication of the first edition of the 'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of
      it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street, Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it
      with wonder, and felt that here was something that touched on depths of my
      humanity. Since then you have grown before me, grown around me, and grown into
      me" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.13.html">Tuesday, April 10, 1888</a>). He praised Whitman in the <em>New York Herald</em> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke,
      <em>Walt Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
      36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
      for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <em>New York Sun</em>, and for the next four years edited the
      weekly labor journal, <em>John Swinton's Paper</em>. When this
      publication folded, he returned to the <em>Sun</em>. See Robert
      Waters, <em>Career and Conversations of John Swinton</em>
      (Chicago: C.H. Kerr, 1902), and Meyer Berger, <em>The History of
         The New York Times, 1851–1951</em> (New York: Simon and Schuster,
      1951), 250–251. See also Donald Yannella, "Swinton, John

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02347_n2">1. Whitelaw Reid
      (1837–1912) was the editor of the New York <em>Tribune</em>
      from 1872 to 1905. He met Whitman in the hospitals during the Civil War. Of his
      relations with the poet Reid later observed: "No one could fail then [during the
      War] to admire his zeal and devotion, and I am afraid that at first my regard
      was for his character rather than his poetry. It was not till long after 'The
      Leaves of Grass' period that his great verses on the death of Lincoln conquered
      me completely"; see Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, Gorham Press, 1915), 213, and
