   <p>I wrote a note this morning and this evening have received yours of 16<u>th</u><sup><a href="#loc.07319_n4" id="r1">1</a></sup> enclosing
      Fanny M. Grunde's<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r2">2</a></sup> quite affecting little letter and Mrs Spaulding's<sup><a href="#n4196" id="r3">3</a></sup> card. You ask me
      whether there is any thing I desire Ed.<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r4">4</a></sup> to bring me from Camden. I do not know that
      there is except the pictures wh I mentioned in mine of this morning. I mean the
      little collection of Photo's and engravings which you are about issuing. I suppose
      you do not want to send me that 1872 L. of G. ? And I do not want you to send it
      untill you are quite ready—but do not
      let somebody else carry it off! I suppose you never found that copy of Harrington?<sup><a href="#loc.07351_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> I
      have never been able to get a copy and it seems as if I never should get one. Yes,
      I
      think we may flatter ourselves that L. of G. has got a <u>locus
         Standi</u> at last.<sup><a href="#loc.07319_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> No one now (unless inspired by ignorance as well as
      stupidity) can hoot at the book as the <u>uncu'guid</u><sup><a href="#loc.07319_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup> thought
      well to do awhile ago. L. of G. has come to stay and <u>must</u>
      be seriously considered by all serious men henceforth whether they like it or
      whether they don't—what the outcome of the consideration will be (on the
      whole) I for one have no fear. I asked you this morning whether you had a man
      engaged in Ed's place<sup><a href="#loc.07319_n6" id="r8">8</a></sup>—I hope you will tell me this as I am anxious about
      it

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and his
      brother–having lost both parents–became wards of Mary O. Davis,
      Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
      inherited part of his estate. <a href="#r8">[back]
