   <p>I return you today the proof in <u>pages</u> I have considered it all very carefully and am quite settled as to the  
      rearrangement<sup><a href="#med.00704_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> of pages, pictures &amp;c. please leave them as I have put them—I
      have not made much change—the burial scenes <u>must</u>
      face different pages as they will only be known as described in "List of
      Illustrations" by that fact—It would not do to print on back of photo-intaglio
      so I have added a leaf—the photo-intaglio will face title
      page—the birth-house will
      face opening of chap I (p. 13)—the "remote" and "immediate"
      "ancestry" pages I have moved as you will see—Van Velsor burial hill picture will
      face p. 15, and W. burial hill picture
      p. 17—Portrait 
      
      
      of father will face p. 26 (mention of his death)—every
      thing else is left as you put it. I want portrait of Mother
      to face mention of her death (towards end of chap I)—then the photograph or
      phototype of W. W. in 1880 might face the opening of chap
      ii (W. W. in 1880)—and fac-simile of writing should face page in that chap.
      where handwriting is mentioned.<sup><a href="#med.00704_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> You told me McKay could get the pictures printed in Phila at $1.80 or $2
      p.m.<sup><a href="#med.00704_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> have a letter from McK. in which he says
      Sherman &amp; Co would charge me $20. p.m. for <u>three</u>,
      however, no matter, they are ordered at De Vinnes N.Y. and will be done immediately.
      I like all your emendations, additions, &amp;c so far (on the whole) very much, &amp;
      can see that you are materially improving the book, for wh I feel very grateful—But dear Walt be very careful like a good fellow with chap iii
      of part ii<sup><a href="#med.00704_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—whatever you do
      dont
      
       slash it up if you make material changes send me the M.S. with proofs that I may
      see
      exactly what they are and consider them—don't fail me in this—that chap
      is the pivot on which the Book turns

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00704_n1">1. It is impossible to
      determine the original location of the illustrations in Bucke's biography, since
      all of his recommendations were followed. The illustrations have no page number,
      but are referred to in the list of "illustrations" (p. 6) as facing a certain
      page.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00704_n2">2. "Portrait from Life of
      Lousia (Van Velsor) Whitman, the Poet's Mother," faces p. 46; "Portrait from
      Life of Walt Whitman in 1880" faces p. 48; and "W. W.'s Handwriting"—a
      facsimile of the holograph of "The Sobbing of the Bells"—faces p.
      54.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00704_n3">3. "p.m." is an
      abbreviation for "proof positive."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00704_n4">4. In "In Analysis of
      Poems, Continued" (part 2, chapter 3), Bucke presents a religious interpretation
      of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Facsimiles of eleven pages of the
      manuscript make it clear that Whitman heavily revised this section (see <em>Whitman's Autograph Revision of the Analysis of Leaves of
         Grass (For Dr. R. M. Bucke's Walt Whitman)</em>, ed. Quentin Anderson [New
      York: New York University Press, 1974], 101, 102, 107, 111, 113, 115, 116, 119,
      121, 123, and 125).<a href="#r4">[back]
