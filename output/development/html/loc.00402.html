      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I wrote you last Monday<sup><a href="#loc.00402_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> asking if you could send me any information in regard to George's getting his money
      in New York. I have not heard from you yet but hope to to-day. I [want you] now, if
      you <em>possibly</em> can get them to me by or before Tuesday morning next to send me those two shirts
      for George &nbsp;He wants them very much indeed &nbsp;Nothing that he can buy will make him
      half as comfortable. The thought just strikes me that perhaps you are using them yourself,
      if so all right, or if you want one and can send him one why do so. If you are not
      using them I think it would be a "big thing" for George to get them as they would be very useful both winter and
      summer. If you send them direct either to George or myself.<sup><a href="#loc.00402_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all well. George is enjoying himself hugely and I shall feel sorry enough when
      he has to go back. All send love to you.
   </p>

   <p>Mother wrote you a letter asking you to send on the shirts but when I left home this
      morning I forgot it so I wrote this one. will send mothers letter this P. M.<sup><a href="#loc.00402_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

      bundle of George's shirts, drawers, &amp;c came safe by Adams express. I sent it
      last Saturday [March 14, 1863], and it ought to have been delivered Monday in

      Whitman of March 11, 1863, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman asked the poet to send
      "those flannel shirts" by express because George thought "he could get them
      better from here than to send them to fortress monroe" (Trent Collection of
      Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections
