   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Isabella Ford
      (1855–1924) was an English feminist, socialist, and writer. Elizabeth
      (Bessie) Ford was her sister. Both were introduced to Whitman's writings by
      Edward Carpenter and they quickly became admirers of the aged poet.

   <p id="bol.00003_n3">2. Whitman is referring to Edward Carpenter.
      Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English writer and Whitman disciple. Like
      many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he deemed Whitman a prophetic
      spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of brotherhood.
      Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as a "disease"
      with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human society cured
      itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a contributing early
      founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you have, as it
      were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually in my heart.
      . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest instinct of their
      nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie
      Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
