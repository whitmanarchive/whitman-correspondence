   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Bethuel Smith, Company F, Second U.S.
      Cavalry, was wounded in 1863. He wrote to Whitman on , from the U.S. General Hospital at Carlisle,
      Pennsylanvia, "I left the armory hospital in somewhat of A hurry." He wrote on
      , from Culpeper, Virginia,
      that he was doing provost duty, and on , he was in a camp near Mitchell Station, Virginia, where "the
      duty is verry hard." He was wounded again on June 11 (so his parents reported to
      Whitman on ), was transported to
      Washington, and went home on furlough on July 1. He returned on August 14 to
      Finley Hospital, where, on , he
      wrote to Whitman: "I would like to see you verry much, I have drempt of you
      often &amp; thought of you oftener still." He expected to leave the next day for
      Carlisle Barracks to be mustered out, and on , he wrote to Whitman from Queensbury, New York. When his parents
      communicated with Walt Whitman on , Bethuel was well enough to perform tasks on the farm. Smith was one
      of the soldiers to whom Whitman wrote ten years later; see Whitman's letter to
      Bethuel Smith, December 1874 (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, 6 vols. [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:318–319).
