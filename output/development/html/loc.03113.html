   <p>Merry Christmas, dear Friend, + a happy New Year!—from frau and me.</p>
   
   
   <p>She is sending Xmas presents, + receiving 'em. I send you a little box of confections
      by Adams Exp. with my love. Besides her, you are the only one I have remembered.
      Sent mine home [
      <span class="unclear">9?</span>]
      
      months ago.
   </p>
   
   <p>Feel pretty poor this winter; we are scrimping + pinching to try to save a little.
      Expenses are so great. Tell me what you hd for Xmas. I got an umbrella 3$, nice one.
      People in Boston were [illegible] over Xmas.
      Never seen the streets <u>so full</u> of happy folks
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Our huge snow-storm has congealed into crust + ice this morning. I have been down
      with a pertinacious cold (bronchial) for 3 weeks. It is too bad you have so many
      troubles (with the "old shack"). I wish I could bear some of yr pain. I wd. gladly
      do it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you suppose a thousand years fr now people will be celebrating the birth of Walt
      Whitman as they are now the birth of Christ? If they don't the more fools they. But I hope they won't
      mythologize you + idiotize themselves as they do over that poor Christ. Why the
      glorious mystic + genius wd have cut his throat if he had known what idiots people
      were to be over him. However he has been an enormous influence for good.
   </p>
   
   <p>"Peace on Earth good will to men."</p>
   
   <p>By the way have you noticed the curious wing-bone-like things the only real angels
      we
      know of are wearing on their shoulders? What fragments the average man + the average
      woman are! The complete hours wd combine them both in perfect musical harmony.
   </p>
   
   <p>I see in Critic (Nov 29 I think) accounts of yr forthcoming book. It pleases me
      much.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
