   <p>I thought to-day I would send you a little picture<sup><a href="#prc.00066_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> to show you I had not forgotten
      you or those meetings in St Louis—I have been back here about a month, &amp;
      am tolerably well—How are you getting along? Let me know if you get the
      picture all right

   <p id="prc.00066_n1">1. This letter bears the
      following address: Charles W Post | Care of B D Buford &amp; Co: | Kansas City |

   <p id="prc.00066_n3">2. Six years after his first
      stroke, at the age of 61, Whitman apparently met the 25-year-old C.W. Post on
      the return leg of the poet's autumn, 1879, western trip. At the time he met
      Whitman, Charles William Post (1854–1914) was a married traveling salesman
      from Springfield, Illinois. He sold agricultural implements for the B. D. Buford
      Company. Destined to become one of America's first multimillionaires, this
      pioneer manufacturer, market researcher, and advertising innovator went on to
      invent and sell the country's first commercial coffee substitute—the early
      health drink, Postum—and to develop the first dry-pack cereals. He is
      often credited as the originator of the prepared food industry (Alice Lotvin
      Birney, "Whitman to C. W. Post: A Lost Letter Located," <em>Walt
         Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 11 [Summer 1993], 30–31). Whitman had
      stopped in St. Louis only briefly while going west, but on returning from
      Denver, he "went on to St. Louis where I remain'd nearly three months with my
      brother T.J.W. (Thomas Jefferson Whitman), and my dear nieces" (<em>Specimen Days</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall [New York: New York
      University Press, 1963], 96).<a href="#r2">[back]

      is the signed and dated ("1880") photograph of Whitman, which is actually an
      1878 image by Napoleon Sarony (<em>Walt Whitman Quarterly
         Review</em> 4 (Fall/Winter 1986–87), 20, 51).<a href="#r3">[back]
