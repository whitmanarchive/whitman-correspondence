   <p>Your card of the 24th came two days ago,<sup><a href="#loc.07545_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> not a little to
      my relief. I was beginning to fear lest you were not so well again. This year ought
      to treat you well, and give you the wind and weather and everything that you love,
      seeing that in it you attain three score and ten. If good wishes of friends were of
      any direct use, physically, I mean, as well as in other ways, it would be the
      happiest year of your life. It seems very right and fit that in it you should
      publish the <em>edition definitive</em> in this vol. of your "complete
      works,"<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r3">3</a></sup> which we all so eagerly expect.
   </p>
   
   <p>The last few weeks have brought nothing perhaps that is very remarkable to the
      surface here. I have been jogging along quietly enough,—but absorbing always a
      great deal humanly from the endlessly wonderful life of this great London. One of
      the most striking episodes I have lately had any share in was the midnight meeting
      of the unemployed of London on Christmas eve. It was held at the foot of Cleopatra's
      Needle, round the base of which the various speakers were grouped, faced by the
      motley throng of men, who cheered hoarsely with hungry throats as the speechifying
      went on. Through the day it had been wet and foggy in turn, but now the sky was of
      an American clearness, the half moon shining bright behind the shaft of Cleopatra's
      Needle, contrasting strangely with the red torches held to light the orators.
      Altogether an impressive scene; and when the Christmas bells rang out, and one of
      the speakers called out—"Peace on earth, good will towards men! If Jesus were
      in London today would he be in those churches?"—and the crowd shouted back,
      "No! he'd be here!—here with us!"—the effect was dramatic in the
      extreme.
   </p>
   
   <p>When I had been standing in the crowd for some time, I discovered Jo Pennell<sup><a href="#loc.07545_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>, the
      artist, standing near me, and we presently went home together. He lives in the next
      street to Cowley Street, from which, by the way, I may have to move shortly, as a
      sister (whom you know) is coming up to town to study music at the Academy.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am writing this at the reading room of the British Museum. I must end it rather
      hurriedly. Don't let me forget to tell you that last night I saw Edward
      Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r5">5</a></sup>—the first time in three years—at a
      meeting of the Fabian Society<sup><a href="#loc.07545_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup>, where he lectured. He looks older than he
      did—more nervous lines in his face. As he is staying in town we shall probably
      meet again.
   </p>
   
   <p>The Scottish Art Review wants me to write an article on The Portraits of Walt
      Whitman<sup><a href="#loc.07545_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup>, with portrait reproductions. Can you send any new pictures of yourself? For
      the present time, so long!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <p id="n4151">3. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="loc.07545_n3">4. Joseph Pennell (1857–1926) 
      was an American illustrator, printmaker, and writer who took up residence in London
      and became
      part of a circle that included Robert Louis Stevenson and George Bernard Shaw (Alan
      M. Fern.

         of Artists</em> [Oxford: University of Oxford Press, 2011]).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n0141b">5. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="loc.07545_n4">6. The Fabian Society emerged in 1884 and 
      was at the center of an upsurge in socialist activity in Britain in the 1880s. They
      played a key 
      role in founding the Labour party in 1990 and have a commitment to non-violent political
      change 
      and social justice that continues today ("Our History." Retrieved
