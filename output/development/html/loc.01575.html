      <br></br><br></br>To Mr. Hotten,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am glad to hear you are having Mr. Conways potograph engraved in place of the bad
      print now in the book.<sup><a href="#loc.01575_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> If a faithful presentation of
      that photograph can be given it will satisfy me well—of course it should be
      reproduced with all its shaggy, dappled, rough-skinned character &amp; not attempted
      to be smoothed, or prettyfied—(if in time I send the following
      hints)—let the costume be kept very simple &amp; broad, &amp; rather kept down
      too, little as there is of it—preserve the effect of the sweeping lines
      making all that fine free angle below the chin—I would suggest not to bring in
      so fully the shoulders &amp; bust as the photograph does—make only the
      neck,<sup><a href="#loc.01575_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> the collar with the immediately
      neighboring part of the shirt delineated. You will see that the spot at the left
      side of the hair, near the temple, is a white blur, &amp; does not belong in the
      picture. The eyes part, and all around the eyes, try to re-produce fully &amp;
      faithfully, exactly as in the photograph.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope you have a good artist at the work. It is perhaps worth your taking special
      pains about, both to achieve a successfull picture &amp; likeness, something
      characteristic, &amp; as certain to be a marked help to your edition of the book.
      Send me an early <em>proof of the engraving</em>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thank you for the papers with notices in them<sup><a href="#loc.01575_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—&amp; for your Academia<sup><a href="#loc.01575_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> criticism. Please continue to send any special notices. I receive them
      safely &amp; promptly. The London Review notice is reprinted here in Littell's
      Living Age.<sup><a href="#loc.01575_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> I should like to know who wrote the piece in the
      Morning Star<sup><a href="#loc.01575_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—it flushed
      my friends &amp; myself too, like a sun-dash, brief, hot, &amp; dazzling.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have several things more to say, &amp; will write again soon<sup><a href="#loc.01575_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>—Also to Mr. Rossetti<sup><a href="#loc.01575_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> to whom,
      meantime, please offer my friendliest, truest regards.<sup><a href="#loc.01575_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Camden Hotten (1832–1873) re-issued
      Algernon Charles Swinburne's first <em>Poems and Ballads</em> in
      1866 after the public outcry caused Swinburne's previous publisher to withdraw.
      Perhaps because he had lived in the United States from 1848 to 1856, Hotten
      introduced such writers as Robert Lowell, Artemus Ward, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
      and Bret Harte to an English audience. After his death, his business was
      purchased by Chatto &amp; Windus. In his letter to Conway on December 5, 1866,
      O'Connor had suggested Hotten as the English publisher of Walt Whitman: "Seems
      to me the courage that prints Laus Veneris might dare this" (Yale). Walt Whitman
      was dissatisfied with Hotten's work, referring to the publisher as "the English
      pirate-publisher" in a , letter to
      Rudolf Schmidt. For Whitman's relationship with Hotten and the "bad &amp;
      defective" edition, see Whitman's , letter to Moncure D. Conway.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01575_n1">1. This draft letter is
      endorsed, "To Mr. Hotten | went April 25 '68."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01575_n2">2. Hotten wrote about the
      portrait on . Whitman first expressed
      interest in switching the frontispiece in his  letter to Hotten.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01575_n3">3. At this point in the
      draft Whitman crudely sketched a face, or "autoportraiture" (Horace Traubel,
      ed., <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.59.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996],
      1:210).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01575_n4">4. Hotten enclosed on  a number of newspaper notices of the
      English edition of Whitman's poems. On , William Michael Rossetti also sent clippings.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01575_n5">5.  that this review had been composed by a Mr.
      Robertson, "a Scotchman of acute intellectual sympathies." Rossetti had restored
      the passages "cut out by a less ardent Editor."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01575_n6">6. 
      <em>Littell's Living Age</em> reprinted notices on April 25, 1868,
      from the <em>London Review of Politics, Society, Literature, Art,
         and Science</em> (16 [March 21, 1868], 288–289), on June 6, 1868, from
      the <em>Saturday Review</em> (25 [May 2, 1868], 589–590),
      and on June 12, 1868, from the <em>Athenaeum</em> (April 25, 1868:
      585–586); see 9, 4th series (1868), 251–252, 637–640, and
      702–703. The critic in <em>The London Review</em> observed:
      "Walt Whitman is, indeed, the Turner of poets. Sometimes you find a mere blurred
      mass of colour; then an incomprehensible blaze of light; then a piece of
      apparent commonplace; and then a picture which overawes the beholder."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01575_n7">7.  that the <em>Morning Star</em> "had
      a very handsome notice…but like all literary reviews in that paper a brief
      one."<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="loc.01575_n8">8. No other communications

   <p id="loc.01575_n10">10. Whitman deleted the next
      line of this draft—"I will think about the American agent too, &amp;
      write"—his answer to Hotten's request of  for the name of "a good agent" in America (Yale; Horace Traubel,
      ed., <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.47.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996],
