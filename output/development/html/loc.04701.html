      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was extremely pleased yesterday morning to receive your post card of the 10th<sup><a href="#loc.04701_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> inst., with its cheerful account of yourself and its loving benediction. Thank you
      from my heart.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How much I feel your kindness I cannot fully tell you. But if, </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>(as you say) you "sent out 'Leaves of Grass' to arouse, &amp; set flowing, endless streams
      of living, pulsating love &amp; friendship, directly from us to yourself, now &amp; ever."—you
      have still further done so, in <u>our</u> fortunate experience, by your continued loving—kindnesses &amp; affectionate words. Thanks,
      and again thanks, &amp; God bless you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To your "terrible, irrepressible yearning—your</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>never-satisfied appetite for sympathy"—alas! we can only partially respond, (for what
      are <u>we</u>?) but our heart's best love is yours, and a reverence &amp; gratitude such as we feel
      towards no one else.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are deeply sorry to learn that you have been so unwell of late. We hoped that the
      improved condition of your health reported to us at Christmastide had continued,—until
      we were alarmed by a newspaper
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>paragraph which seemed to shew that you had had a bad relapse. It is reassuring now to learn that it has not been
      so bad as we feared, &amp; that you "might be much worse."—&amp; we hope to hear better news
      before long.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The other night I picked up a little book at the Railway bookstall, which I have been
      looking over tonight. It is called: "<u>In Darkest London</u>"
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>and is a story of a Salvation Army captain engaged in the East end. It gives a very
      painful &amp; realistic account of the horrible misery, destitution &amp; vice prevailing,
      &amp; of the noble self-sacrificing effects of men &amp; women, (Agnostics, Salvationists
      &amp;c) who with love &amp; pity, do what they can to lessen its misery. The hero of the story
      breaks down in health, &amp; is ordered into Kent, where he visits a
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>village graveyard.—"Long grass grew over the graves, such as Walt Whitman calls 'the
      hair of the dead'" &amp;c &amp;c.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To find your name in such a story was like seeing a beam of light in a dark place.
      And I was glad to think of, &amp; to read once more, your "<u>Song of the Universal</u>," &amp; to be cheered by its "quenchless faith."
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Last night I called to enquire about a young girl, (18), who is slowly dying. It stirred
      me to hear the accounts of her:—"a triumph of patience. When she is the better side
      out she is always singing. (Can scarcely hear her speak but <u>sings</u> pretty clearly)—and when in pain praising."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Out of the mouths of babes &amp; sucklings Thou hast ordained strength," and things</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>"hid from the wise &amp; prudent" are "revealed to babes."<sup><a href="#loc.04701_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Surely this is the victory that overcomes the world—a victory we should all share—the
      glad soul recognizing tender love &amp; care &amp; grounds for hope—in <u>all</u> the circumstances of life &amp; death.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I cannot write any more now. But with best love always</p>
   
   
   <p>I remain</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
