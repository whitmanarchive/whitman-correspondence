      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr Walt Whitman, of New York, writes me, that he wishes to obtain employment in the
      public service in Washington, &amp; has made, or is about making some application to yourself.
      Permit me to say that he is known to me as a man of strong original genius, combining, with marked
      eccentricities, great powers &amp; valuable traits of character: a self-relying, large-hearted
      man, much beloved by his friends; entirely patriotic &amp; benevolent in his theory, tastes,
      &amp; practice. If his writings are in certain points open to criticism, they yet show extraordinary power, &amp; are more
      deeply American, democratic, &amp; in the interest of political liberty, than those of
      any other poet. He is indeed a child of the people, &amp; their champion.
      A man of his talents &amp; dispositions will quickly make himself useful, and, if the Government has work that he can do, I think it may easily find, that it
      has called to its side more valuable aid than it bargained for.
   </p>
   
   <p>With great respect,</p>
   
   <p>Your obedient servant,</p>
