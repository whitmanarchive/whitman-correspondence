   <p>Pleasant cool, calm sunny weather—a rain quite hard, &amp; early this

      better—took a quite elaborate wash (bath) in a way that I like—helping
      myself leisurely—ab't two hours ago—&amp; handled myself decidedly better
      than five days ago—a sort of nibble <em>of strength</em>—Yours of 26th rec'd—welcomed &amp; cheering—I have

      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07648_n1">1. This letter is addressed
      to: Dr R M Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden,

   <p id="n3999">2. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07648_n2">3. Whitman could not publish
      <em>November Boughs</em> (1888) until after the appearance of
      "Army and Hospital Cases" in the October issue of <em>Century</em>
      (see also Whitman's  letter to
      Bucke). In his reply to this letter on , Bucke offered the following suggestion: "I think myself a good
      idea would be to print a hundred or two hundred copies on good (and large)
      paper, bind them nicely and sell yourself for $5. or even $10. with
      autograph, by &amp; by publish through McKay or another."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n2002">4. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4108">5. Ignatius Loyola Donnelly
      (1831–1901) was a politician and writer, well known for his notions of
      Atlantis as an antediluvian civilization and for his belief that Shakespeare's
      plays had been written by Francis Bacon, an idea he argued in his book <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in Shakespeare's
         Plays</em>, published in 1888.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07648_n3">6. <em>Mr.
         Donnelly's Reviewers</em> was published posthumously. On  Bucke wrote: "I am glad you are
      getting cheerful letters from O'Connor. I trust he is not suffering so much
      these times. Am a little sorry he is worrying himself about the Cryptogram which
      I fear is more or less of a fraud though perhaps not intentionally so on
      Donnelly's part" (see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.26.html">Thursday, August 9, 1888</a>).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n6122">8. Logan Pearsall Smith
      (1865–1946) was an essayist and literary critic. He was the son of Robert
      Pearsall Smith, a minister and writer who befriended Whitman, and he was the
      brother of Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, one of Whitman's most avid followers.
