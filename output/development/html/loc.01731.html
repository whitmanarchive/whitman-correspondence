      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have taken the liberty to send you by this post a copy of Mr. Swinburne's new book
      upon <u>William Blake</u>, poet and artist—a great but
      neglected genius who was counted as a madman by his contemporaries here sixty years
      ago. As Mr. Swinburne makes mention of yourself in this, his most recent published
      composition, it is but right that you should see what is said. But irrespective of
      that I feel assured—from what Mr. M. D. Conway tells me—that the book
      will interest you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr Conway will have told you of our intention to publish an English edition of your
      "poems"—or rather a <u>"selection"</u> from
      them—edited by Mr. W. M. Rossetti, one of our most able critics, and himself a
      poet. In about a week I shall send you a copy by post. It makes a handy vol. of
      about 440 pages, &amp; will I think be a 
      favourite
      
       here. Mr. Rossetti's introduction is most admirable, and gives great
      satisfaction to your admirers and his friends.
   </p>
   
   <p>Now, we want the privilege of selling copies of this "selection" in 
       the United States—if you will allow us: and I have told Mr. Conway that I would give
      you—or your agent—a royalty of one shilling (or 25 cents gold) upon every copy
      sold in your country.
   </p>
   
   <p>I imagine that the sale of this "selection" in your country would serve as whet, or
      stimulant, to readers to secure copies of the <u>complete</u>
      works. I really don't think it would materially interfere with the sale of the
      latter.
   </p>
   
   <p>On this English edition I will ask your acceptance of a share of our
      profits—after the original outlay in paper, printing, &amp; binding, has been
      returned to the
      publisher.
   </p>
   
   <p>I was greatly gratified this afternoon in having almost the <u>first</u> copy of Mr. Robert Buchanan's new vol. of <u>"Essays"</u> placed in my hands. I was <u>gratified</u>
      because in the middle of the book his admirable paper upon your "poems—the
      article wch recently appeared in the <u>Broadway</u>—is
      given.
   </p>
   
   <p>I think, in conclusion, that I ought to apologise for sending this familiarly written
      letter to you, as I am but a trader—a bookseller—and have only an
      acquaintance with your books of some years standing to offer as an excuse. True,
      the first copies imported into this country were at the order of the undersigned;
      but, that, it is feared, will not in any way palliate the liberty now taken.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Perhaps because he had lived in the
      United States from 1848 to 1856, London publisher John Camden Hotten
      (1832–1873) introduced such writers as Robert Lowell, Artemus Ward, Oliver
      Wendell Holmes, and Bret Harte to an English audience. Hotten published <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/books/other/rossetti.html">Poems by Walt Whitman</a></em>, selected and edited by William
      Michael Rossetti, in 1868. Whitman was dissatisfied with Hotten's work, however,
      referring to him as "the English pirate-publisher" in a , letter to Rudolf Schmidt. For Whitman's
      relationship with Hotten and the "bad &amp; defective" edition, see Whitman's
      , letter to Moncure D. Conway.
      After Hotten's death, his business was purchased by Chatto &amp; Windus, who
      reprinted the text of <em>Poems by Walt Whitman</em> in 1886 and
      several subsequent printings.
