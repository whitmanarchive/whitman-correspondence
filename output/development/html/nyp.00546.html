   <p>I send you a note of introduction to J A Symonds—whom I think most likely &amp;
      valuable, for the purpose you spoke of—(if I rightly understood
      it)—Symonds has leisure, has long been a reader of L of G.—&amp; I have
      heard has for some time been wanting to have something to say in print about
      it—If possible send him at first a copy of your complete book, in proof from
      the types, or type-written in slips, complete<sup><a href="#nyp.00546_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—In
      fact get two or three such copies, &amp; send me one in advance—No doubt I
      would see many important corrections to be made—or additions—or
      elisions—Maybe (though may-be <em>not</em> too)—J A S
      would like the chance of giving his say, in such introduction—I dont think
      well of requesting any thing from Dowden<sup><a href="#nyp.00546_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00546_n1">1. Apparently Kennedy was
      encouraged to undertake a longer study after Whitman's praise of <em>The Poet as A Craftsman</em> (see the letter from Whitman to
      Kennedy of ). Kennedy's letter of
       had been filled with ambitious
      plans: "The book on you that I had been contemplating for some years is coming
      bravely to the birth. It has burst from me as from a ripe pomegranate, its seeds
      come from me with throes. I have been 2 weeks in a fever of parturition. . . .
      Knortz has been at me twice to make this book, &amp; I hope you will not be
      displeased. . . . Dr. Bucke's book is invaluable, but it lacks profundity &amp;
      literary knack in its treatment of the work (analysis) &amp; estimate of the
      problems involved. In fact I find it quite inadequate in these respects."
      Kennedy of course, did not know that Bucke's book was really Whitman's book. On
       Kennedy again lauded his book ("Walt
      Whitman, the Poet of Humanity"): "I have completed (rough finish) my seven
      chapters on you. They are the most stunning eulogy &amp; defence a poet ever
      rec'd I do believe—260 pp—Have done for you what Ruskin did for
      Turner." On , Kennedy spelled out the
      contents of his seven chapters: "Enfans d'Adam," "Whitman's Title To Greatness,"
      "The Style of Leaves of Grass," "Analytical Introduction To Leaves of Grass,"
      "Democrat &amp; Comrade," "Passage To India," and "Walt Whitman and His
      Friends," to be followed by an appendix, conclusion, and bibliography. Without
      consulting Whitman, Kennedy had begun negotiations for publication. Frederick W.
      Wilson, the Scottish publisher of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, was
      not willing to undertake publication when he wrote to Kennedy on April 24, 1886,
      because the trade "is so terribly depressed that all enterprise is knocked on
      the head" (Trent Collection, Duke University). This manuscript was the first of
      several drafts of what became two books, <em>Reminiscences of Walt
         Whitman</em> (1896) and <em>The Fight of a Book for the
         World</em> (1926). Part of the manuscript with Whitman's corrections is in
      the Trent Collection, Duke University. For Whitman's conflicting opinions of
      Kennedy's study, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.35.html">Saturday, August 18, 1888</a>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00546_n2">2. On  Kennedy had requested a letter of
      introduction from Whitman to Dowden. Since Dowden always wrote sympathetically,
      Whitman's remark is somewhat puzzling. On 
      Edward T. Potter sent an extract from Dowden's most recent reference to Whitman;
      see "The Interpretation of Literature," <em>The Contemporary
         Review</em>, 49 (May 1886), 701–719.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00546_n3">3. <em>Nature
         and Literature: A Ruskin Anthology</em>, compiled by William Sloane Kennedy,
      was published in 1886.<a href="#r3">[back]
