   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00472_n8">1. 
      This letter dates to October 16 or 23, 1867. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the
      letter October 10, 1866, and Edwin Haviland Miller accepted Bucke's date
      (see Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 1:293, n. 57). Bucke and Miller's
      date is incorrect: the letter dates just over a year later. Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman cannot date to the year 1866 because
      Walt in his October 16, 186[6?] fragment states that "I have not heard any
      thing from you the last week." If this letter dates October 10, 1866
      (Wednesday), Walt would have heard from Louisa "last week," if his
      fragmentary letter dates October 16, 1866 (Tuesday). The second, decisive
      factor in dating this letter to October 1867 is Louisa's housing situation,
      which though unpleasant in October 1866 did not become seriously unsettled
      until after Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman departed for St. Louis in May
      1867. Louisa's housing difficulties became acute in 1867, after Jeff's
      departure, which led his wife, Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman to leave the
      Pacific Street home and stay with Gordon F. Mason's family in Towanda,
      Pennsylvania, from June to September 1867 (see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1977], 37, 42). Louisa in this letter
      conveys from George Washington Whitman a description of a Portland Avenue
      lot that Walt could be interested in purchasing. The fragment in which Walt
      offers to raise $2000 is in response to this letter. Miller's conjectured
      date for Walt's fragmentary letter must be rejected in favor of a few days
      after this letter, to a range from October 18 to October 30, 1867 (cf. Walt
      Whitman's  letter fragment to
      Louisa, <em>The Correspondence</em>, 1:293).<br><br>
      Because this letter dates a year later than previously determined by Bucke
      and Miller, to October 16 or 23, 1867, the fragmentary letter from Walt
      Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman that Miller assigned to 1866 must be
      reassigned, and Kim Roberts's calendar of Walt's Washington boarding places
      must be revised as well. According to Roberts, Walt moved to 468 M Street
      South (Graysons) in January 1865, to 364 13th Street West in February 1866,
      and to 472 M Street South (same house as Graysons, then under Mrs. Newton
      Benedict) in 1867 (<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00933.pdf">"A Corrected Map of Whitman's Washington Boarding Houses and Work
         Places,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 22 [Summer 2004], 136).
      But the date that Roberts assigns for Walt's move from the Graysons
      (February 1866) is incorrect. Walt in summer 1866 was boarding with the
      Graysons: "Mrs. Grayson gives me plenty of good vegetables, peas string
      beans, squash [...] the house is very pleasant this weather—as cool as
      it can be any where" (see his 
      letter to Louisa).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00472_n13">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      received Walt Whitman's October 15 or 22, 1867 letter (not extant). Edwin
      Haviland Miller, who dated this letter from Louisa to October 10, 1866, dated
      Walt's letter to Louisa (not extant) October 9, 1866 (<em>Correspondence</em>, 1:369).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00472_n7">3. Walt Whitman formerly
      boarded with Juliet Grayson and her mother Mary Mix at 468 M Street North.
      Juliet Grayson died in January 1867 (see Walt Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman). After her
      death, Whitman returned to the same house to board under the new proprietors Mr.
      and Mrs. Newton Benedict, but he was confined to a small attic (see his  letter to Louisa).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00472_n2">4. Jessie Louisa Whitman
      (1863–1957) was the younger daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman
      and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and sister-in-law.
      Jessie and her sister Manahatta "Hattie" were both favorites of their uncle
      Walt. The nickname "Sis" was given first to Manahatta but was passed to her
      younger sister Jessie Louisa when Manahatta became "Hattie." The letter dates to
      1865, so "Sis" is Jessie Louisa.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00472_n3">5. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. After residing in Brooklyn in a home shared with Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Louisa's son Eddy, in early 1868 Mattie and her daughters
      moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in May 1867 to assume the
      position of Superintendent of Water Works. For more on Martha Whitman, see the
      introduction to Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters
         of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      1–26.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00472_n11">6. Walt Whitman originally
      planned to depart Brooklyn to return to Washington, D.C., on September 30, 1867
      (see his  letter to William D.
      O'Connor), but his return may have been delayed a week or so (see his  letter to Francis P. Church and
      William C. Church and his  letter
      to Alfred Pratt).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">7. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00472_n5">8. A man known only as Smith
      was George Washington Whitman's partner in building houses on speculation. Walt
      Whitman described Smith as "a natural builder and carpenter (practically and in
      effect) architect," and he advised John Burroughs that Smith was an "honest,
      conscientious, old-fashioned man, a man of family . . . . youngish middle age"
      (see Walt's  letter to John
      Burroughs).<a href="#r8">[back]
