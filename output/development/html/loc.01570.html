   <p>I send the accompanying article<sup><a href="#loc.01570_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> in hopes you can do me the favor to dispose of it to an English magazine. 
      The one I first think of is the Fortnightly Review. If not that, some other. 
      I place the whole business, price, &amp;c. in your absolute control. 
      Only understand that the piece is to be published here in the <em>Galaxy</em> for May. 
      Some English magazine for May is what would suit best. In haste.

      regret to say I was unable to do anything with the proof of Personalism. I tried
      several magazines, but they were already made up for their May numbers" (Horace
