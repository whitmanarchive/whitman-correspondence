      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing new or particular to write about—I thought I would send you Tennyson's last
      letter—(written some time since but by misdirection had to be ret'd &amp; only reached me lately)<sup><a href="#sjs.00013_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Send it back to me when through—I send you a muddled sort of criticism in a late
      English magazine, of no particular interest<sup><a href="#sjs.00013_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Send it back also—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How are you getting along? How is 'Sula? how the baby? Tell me, when you write, about
      Smith<sup><a href="#sjs.00013_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—give him my love—I still keep well &amp; bustling for me—have been down in the country
      much of the fall, but am now here probably for the winter—Wish I was with you &amp; 'Sula
      for a few weeks—often think about you all—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Got a letter from London from Trübner day before yesterday for six sets of my books,
      remitting the (wholesale) price—I sell a set now &amp; then—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The Gilchrists (Mrs G. and Herbert &amp; Grace) are at 177 Remsen street Brooklyn—Jeannette
      Gilder<sup><a href="#sjs.00013_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> has written to me that she is going to write my life &amp; asking for items &amp;c—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd the Scribner for Nov:<sup><a href="#sjs.00013_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> I suppose from you—Three days storm &amp; gale here, but beautiful &amp; clear to-night—I
      am going out for an hour—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="sjs.00013_n1">1. See the letter from
      Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of .<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="sjs.00013_n3">3. Smith Caswell was one of
      Burroughs' hired hands (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
      178). In the <em>New York Tribune</em> on May 17, 1879, Whitman
      described Caswell ploughing in a raspberry field (<em>Specimen
         Days</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall [New York: New York University Press, 1963],
      340). After Burroughs informed Whitman of the death of Caswell's brother,
      Charles, the poet copied verbatim Burroughs's sketch of the young man in "Three
      Young Men's Deaths," printed in <em>Cope's Tobacco Plant</em> and
      later in <em>Specimen Days</em> (157–158). Whitman sent the
      article to John Fraser, the editor of <em>Cope's Tobacco
         Plant</em>, on , through Josiah
      Child (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). See
      also the letter from Whitman to John Burroughs of .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00013_n4">4. Jeannette Leonard Gilder
      (1849–1916) was Richard Watson Gilder's sister. Whitman met her, probably
      for the first time, at a reception given by her brother on June 14, although he
      wrote to her in 1875 (see the letter from Whitman to an unidentified
      correspondent of ). At this time
      Jeannette Gilder was writing a literary column for the <em>New
         York Herald</em>. With her brother Joseph, she founded <em>The
         Critic</em> in 1881 and was its editor until 1906. Whitman wrote to
      Jeannette Gilder, evidently about the biographical sketch, on December 20, 22,
      and 30 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). See also the letter from Whitman to John
      Burroughs of .<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="sjs.00013_n5">5. Burroughs's "Picturesque
      Aspects of Farm Life in New York" appeared in the November issue of <em>Scribner's Monthly</em>, 17 (1878), 41–54.<a href="#r5">[back]
