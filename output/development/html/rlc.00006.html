      <br></br><br></br>My dear Rudolf Schmidt,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#rlc.00006_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have sent you some books by Mr. Clausen<sup><a href="#rlc.00006_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—All the real flavor of American fun resides in its <em>idioms</em>, which are untranslatable expressions of elements in the places, people, &amp; <em>nativities</em> here—perceptible enough here, but in the nature of things invisible &amp; inaudible to
      a foreigner—The extracts I enclose will illustrate—<sup><a href="#rlc.00006_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Mr. Clausen started for Denmark last Saturday, June 1st.</p>
   
   
   <p>I am just having your criticism <em>fully</em> rendered into English—I am to obtain possession of it next Thursday<sup><a href="#rlc.00006_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—From what I get of it, in advance, it is going to prove the grandest response &amp; praise
      yet given anywhere to me &amp; my poems. I rec'd the newspaper. I shall keep you advised
      of any printed use made of your criticism in this country—(The brief of the N. Y.
      <em>Commercial Advertiser</em>, has been copied in the papers somewhat.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>From the 10th of June to 10th of July I shall be home in Brooklyn, New York, &amp; then
      return here again—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are in the midst of the preparations &amp; canvassing for one of our national elections—the
      election is next November—(for President for the term from March 4, 1873, to March
      4, 1877)—There is nothing very radical or important in the political questions—it
      is mostly an excitement of personal piques, &amp; for the <em>spoils</em>, as we call it, (i.e. the pay &amp; perquisites of office)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>One of our great <em>nominating Conventions</em> is just now meeting, (at Philadelphia)<sup><a href="#rlc.00006_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—You would enjoy the sight of such a spectacle greatly—there are many hundreds of
      <em>delegates</em>, and many thousands of active interested followers. (All <em>voluntary</em>—all perfectly good natured)—such talking, such gesticulation, such immense crowds
      by day &amp; night—such manoevering by the different coteries, for their favorite men,
      (to get "the nomination")—&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.—It is all very salutary exercise for the bulk
      of the people. But the <em>spectacular</em> part of the scenes is the best, especially at night—many bands of music—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="rlc.00006_n1">1. Rudolf Schmidt, editor of
      <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em>, wrote to Walt Whitman on
      October 19, 1871: "I intend to write an article about yourself and your writings
      in the above named periodical which is very much read in all the Scandinavian
      countries. …I therefore take the liberty to ask you, if you should not be
      willing to afford some new communications of yourself and your poetry to this
      purpose" (Library of Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00006_n2">2. Carl F. Clausen, identified
      by Schmidt as "my old friend and countryman," corresponded with Schmidt after he
      left Denmark in 1860; see <em>Orbis Litterarum</em>, 7 (1949),
      34–39. The city directory in 1870 listed him as a draughtsman and in 1872
      as a patent agent. He died of consumption in the middle 1870s; see Thomas Biggs
      Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook
      #108.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00006_n3">3. 
      , Schmidt made a request:
      "Will you do me a service? I should like to write an article on 'American
      fancy' contrasting the grotesque humor that is scattered with no pretension
      in your newspapers with the humor of Luther and Shakespeare…Could you
      not find for me about a dozen jokes of this sort."<br><br>
      With this letter are three newspaper clippings: "American Slang in England,"
      "Artemus Ward and the Press," and "Yankee Talk."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00006_n4">4. Emil Arctander, who was
      acting vice-consul for Denmark, translated Schmidt's article for Walt Whitman.
      According to his letters of June 17 and 20, 1872, (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.), Arctander did not complete his self-styled "weak translation"
      until later in the month. The translation, with scores of corrections in Walt
      Whitman's hand, is in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.<a href="#r4">[back]
