   <p>You know that I have written to you last,<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r1">1</a></sup> and I cannot tell how it is that you will
      not answer my letter, I did not mean to offend you, but if I did will you please 
      foregive
      
       me, I am here with friend Sharp,<sup><a href="#n1041" id="r2">2</a></sup> and a lonely time I am 
      haveing
      
       of it; I have not been away from here any time till Tuesday, since I was
      up to see you, then as father<sup><a href="#n0852" id="r3">3</a></sup> was so sick that he could not do anything I had to stay
      home and work for 
      
      him; as he was going to kill hogs Wednesday; so I had to loose
      three days right off; I was to Camden yesterday and would of 
      stoped
      
       to [illegible] until I [illegible] you know that I cannot enjoy 
      myselfe
      
       any more at home, if I go up in my room I always come down feeling worse
      than I do when I go up, for the first thing I see is your picture, and when I come
      down in the sitting room there hangs the same, and whenever I do anything, or say
      anything the picture seems to me is always looking at me; so I find that I am better
      sattesfied when I am here than when I am home. 
      
      When Herbret<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r4">4</a></sup> was down he
      said you was
      very well and happy. I talked to him and got out all I could, but that was
      not much. I have but [
      <span class="unclear">found a girlfriend?</span>]
       and that [
      <span class="unclear">is to say, she is a?</span>]
       good and true
      friend to me, we have had many good times togeather, but none that hangs with me like
      those you and I have had. I received a letter from her last night, she said that she
      was well, and thought of coming over soon. I suppose you know that father has had
      another hemorrhage, but he is better now but he will never be able to do any more
      hard work. "Ned Rogers" is coming over to 
      
      help him to day: the little Irish [illegible] have got through
      with the 
      deviding
      
       of the place: they have each taken a part of it, and now it is <u>settled</u>. I hope that you will not keep this letter or tell
      anyone what it contains, I don't want our 
      folkes
      
       to know that I have been so foolish as to write to you when you will not
      answer. There is one thing that I have foregotten, it is this Mont has been going to
      School at the Haddon institute for sometime 
      
      he likes it 
      fystrait.
      I will have to close my letter, as the paper is running on so adieu if I
      never hear from you will think of you as an old friend that is dead and gon.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0590">1. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1041">2. B.K. Sharp was Harry's employer,
      according to Edwin Haviland Miller (see "Introduction," <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1964],
      3:6).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0852">3. George Stafford was the father of
      Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's
      parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near
      Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. For more
      on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>" <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, eds., (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 685.<a href="#r3">[back]

      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
