   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00606_n5">1. This letter dates to August
      22, 1871. The date August 22 is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard
      Maurice Bucke dated the letter to the year 1871. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed
      with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:369). The year designated by
      Bucke and affirmed by Miller is correct because it is consistent with a visit to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman by Julia Hine after the death of her husband, Charles
      Hine (also see Louisa's  letter to
      Walt Whitman).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">3. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00606_n8">4. Walt Whitman was invited to
      read at the opening of the American Institute, a long-running Brooklyn fair that
      displayed flowers, plants, fruits, and products of American industry and
      manufacture. The fair buildings, which occupied 100,000 square feet, were
      located on the block enclosed by Second and Third Avenue and Sixty-third and
      Sixty-fourth Street (<em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, September 14,
      1871, 1). Whitman opened the American Institute on September 7, 1871, with a
      recitation of "After All, Not to Create Only." The poem was widely reprinted
      (see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/index.html">"Poems in Periodicals"</a> and Whitman's  draft letter to the American Institute Committee on
      Invitations). The dates for Whitman's travel to Brooklyn, New York, and his
      return to Washington, D.C., are not known.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00606_n14">5. Julia A. Hine, widow of
      Charles Hine (1827–1871), indicated her intent to visit Walt Whitman's
      mother in Brooklyn shortly after her husband's death (see Julia Hine's  letter to Walt Whitman; for her name
      Julia, see <em>United States Census, 1870</em>). Charles Hine was
      a portrait and figure painter, and his painting of Walt Whitman became the
      frontispiece for <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1860. He died on July
      31, 1871, only days after a visit from Whitman. Julia Hine may have visited
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in part because Walt had reported his mother
      "ill—some of the time very ill" (see Walt Whitman's July 14, 1871 letter
      to Charles Hine, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Ted Genoways
      [Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2004], 7:31; and see <em>Connecticut, Deaths and Burials Index, 1650–1934</em> [Salt Lake
      City: FamilySearch, 2009]).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00606_n21">6. The oldest daughter of
      Charles and Julia Hine, named Minnie, was born in 1859 (<em>United
         States Census, 1870</em>).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00606_n19">7. Julia Hine's companion,
      Mrs. Judson, has not been identified.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00606_n15">8. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      originally wrote, "my sympathy for her strong." She then canceled the word "my"
      and the phrase "for her strong." She inserted "i felt great" above the canceled
      word "my." The revised phrase is "i felt great sympathy."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00606_n13">9. Julia Hine in her  letter to Walt Whitman wrote, "Mr.
      Townsend, a dear friend of Charley's, has sent you a paper with a pleasant
      article written by himself." The review of Whitman's work by a Townsend in a
      Providence, Rhode Island, newspaper has not been identified.<a href="#r9">[back]
