       Whittier—

       I will if the spirit moves me—I cannot tell decidedly at this
      moment, but will try—cannot tell either what extent the piece (if any)
      will be, nor price—

      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Browning:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Please go over personally to see Walt Whitman and ask him to write an ode about
      the good old Poet John Greenleaf Whittier. It must be ready to send us by
      messenger or by telegraph <u>on Wednesday</u> afternoon or
      evening. (If by telegraph, insert the word paragraph at the end of each line to
      ensure accuracy.) 
   </p>
   
   <p> Tell the good old man Whitman, from Mr Bennett, that Mr Bennett will be glad to
      pay him well for a brief ode on the subject. Then let me know when you send the
      lines what he expects, and I will see that a check is sent him 
   </p>
