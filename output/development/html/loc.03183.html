      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt;  
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The Hicks bust<sup><a href="#loc.03183_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> has probably reached you by this time, or, is in Phila. It was sent first of the
      week. I used it at my talk last week. Think I shall put up another for my own use.
      I have taken a studio
      
      here, and am busy getting up an entertainment to come off in the <u>Grand Opera House</u> two weeks from Monday next—"A Day's life in a Sculptor's Studio." 3 parts—or acts—
      Morning, afternoon &amp; evening. Assisted by the Y.M.C.A. Senate. This Senate is a debating
      society of the Y.M.C.A &amp; all the fellows are <u>enthusiastic</u> over my enterprise. I give
      
      half the proceeds to the Y.M.C.A. a part of which the <u>Senate</u> is to have for a library. They are all bright fellows &amp; full of vim, fredom, &amp; fun. The awful burden of New England orthodoxy does not bear heavily upon their
      souls—not even the Elders are [
      <span class="unclear">grim?</span>]
       with the idea of salvation. I find I can co-operate with them &amp; do my work
      
      on common ground. They have sent for [
      <span class="unclear">fotos?</span>]
       of the <u>founder</u> of the Y.M.C.A who lives in London "Exeter Hall,"<sup><a href="#loc.03183_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> they say, "is the result of a little prayer meeting that took place in his room over
      forty years ago." I am to make a bust of him, with the idea of selling copies to the
      "Y.M.C." associations 
      
      throughout the country. When you consider that they are thicker than plums in a pudding,
      the prospect seems good for a sale of many copies—especially if it starts with the
      approbation of leading "associations" in Phila &amp; New York. I am really glad to do
      this work—If it puts "boodle" in my purse, it will also impart a
      
      certain new life to the rising swarm of human "critters" these associations gather
      together.
   </p>         
   
   <p>My exhibition will include a variety of things. On the stage in rear I shall have
      my assistants as a modeling class, dressed in grey tunics. I shall be in regalia myself—long
      gown &amp; appropriate head piece. The fellows will furnish glee club, &amp; grand &amp; lofty
      trebling.
      
      During the noon interruption between 1st 2nd parts, they will (draped in white with
      powdered faces &amp; hands) form a pyramid climbing upon one another as high as the ceiling,
      to be ready the moment the curtain rises, as I enter upon the stage, to tumble to
      the ground or floor—so much fallen statuary. They do this thing to perfection &amp; it
      creates an uproar. I am to have busts &amp; all things I can obtain
      
      pertaining to studio well equiped. The modeling room will be rear of stage, so it can be shut off with curtains on
      occasion. I shall have visitors, women &amp; <u>art patron</u> and children, boys &amp; girls come in for instruction—sort of [
      <span class="unclear">Kindergarden?</span>]
      . And much more, but all finally so arranged &amp; compacted that it will run smooth &amp;
      occupy 2½ hours.
   </p>                    
   
   
   <p>There are certain reasons why I desire to make a short address before the curtain
      at the start. Some things to say that will awaken the <u>religiousness</u> of art in America democratically considered. Ten minutes will suffice. Between acts
      then will be music &amp; stereoptican views on curtains. I will send you perfected program.
      I will put my best work into the business, &amp; if it
      
      is a <u>hit</u>, the way may open for all we have talked about. I am going to send for my Cleveland
      statue &amp; your bust.<sup><a href="#loc.03183_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I had an invite to go to Indianapolis for a lecture to the Y.M.C.A there, last night.
      Shall probably drift that way in due season.
   </p> 
   
   <p>I have an idea it doesn't matter <u>where</u> one starts. So he starts, even in a small way. The continuation, if he has got anything
      worth c, will follow—You 
      know the scripture—faithful over a few things first, &amp; then rules over many.<sup><a href="#loc.03183_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>To change the subject—what a storm your way! Are you also snowed in? Is the back yard
      filled with snow up to your sitting room window? The window where the little bantums enter for their roost in the cellar. No snow here, but cold, cold, cold.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother begins to feel wearied by it all, and longs for the green grass &amp; birds, so
      she can get out, &amp; stir up her rheumatic limbs. Every time there is the first approach
      to warmishness outdoors—&amp; we have had several spring suggesting days—she starts out
      on her pilgrimage about the yard, &amp; to the shop where she sits &amp; chats with the store
      workers. I wish you could see her. I think (tho she is my mother) she is a fine specimen of an old lady: so calm &amp; broad; large &amp;
      cheerful. 
      
      And I find she is one of the very best of readers. Her voice is still clear &amp; strong—musical
      and persuasive. She weighs now not far from 190 lbs; but is not what you would call
      fat. Her cheeks are plump &amp; solid. She takes the liveliest interest in the daily papers,
      &amp; the illustrations. Says "I read advertisements as much as anything, for there I
      find out what's going on about as much as anywhere." If she were not quite so old,
      I think
      
      I would start out with her on a <u>starring</u> tour. I'd like to introduce the <u>Queen</u> to her.—
   </p>
   
   <p>I often think of you and Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r5">5</a></sup> there with your daily round of "so, so" and "all the same." Your simple good dinners,
      beef &amp; rice fritters, &amp; the tea pot, and the visitors, all welcome without ado—except
      when they come to <u>convert</u> you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Please show Mrs. D. this letter, &amp; ask her if she knows Brown's address. I wrote him
      &amp; the letter comes back. He thinks
      
      I am sure I have treated him badly; but I am not at fault—I gave the old address—at
      least.
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you hear from Herbert?<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r6">6</a></sup> I do not hear from Harned;<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n1" id="r7">7</a></sup> but I suppose he must be all right again. Isn't about the time Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r8">8</a></sup> was with you? What about O'Connor?<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r9">9</a></sup> Do you hear from him? I got no paper or letter from Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r10">10</a></sup> of late.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, the sun shines brightly, but the air is cold. I am very comfortable &amp; quiet
      though, in my new studio, and 
      
      in excellent health. Last Saturday one of the fellows drove me out four miles &amp; we
      got a barrel of nice clay—dug it right out of a side hill—not a mite of dirt or gravel
      in it. Fine as satin. I felt like doffing my hat to old Dame nature. I went on a [
      <span class="unclear">piece?</span>]
       to one of his "farmer friends" to  dinner, &amp; had a good ride on a horse's back, the
      first for 20 years. You must understand this is no "pent up Utica,"<sup><a href="#loc.03183_n5" id="r11">11</a></sup> but spreads out infinitely. Next time I must tell you something of Earlham (Quaker)
      College — a mile out. I took
      
      tea out there with the Scholars some 150 in all one evening last week. Had some talk
      with the president. He is evidentaly touched with the new spring tide in modern world.
      Quite a senisible, good man.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, it will tire you out to read this lenthy epistle. I am most ashamed to send it, so <u>garrulous</u> it will seem. But, you've been through so much, it may not overwhelm you.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Kind regards.
      <br></br>Sidney.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If Horace should drop in, &amp; he [illegible] to objection, let him see this letter. I haven't time to write him just now.</p>

      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,

   <p id="n0119">8. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of

      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier

      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
