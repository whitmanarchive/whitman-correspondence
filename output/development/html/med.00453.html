   </p>
   
   
   <p>Let me by this introduce to you an old and valued friend of mine, J. B. Marvin, who
      is making a short visit to London on business.<sup><a href="#med.00453_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Mr. Marvin is a New Englander, literary, democratic, has a family, and has a position
      in the Treasury at Washington.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I still continue here, laid up, but working a very little. Best wishes, congratulations
      etc. on the <em>marriage</em>.
      Kindest respects to Mrs. Rossetti. I have lately received a good kind letter from
      Tennyson.<sup><a href="#med.00453_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Write soon and freely. I am pretty lonesome here.</p>
