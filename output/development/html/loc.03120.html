      <br></br><br></br>Dear WW.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yes of course let Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r3">3</a></sup> have it (the Dutch article<sup><a href="#loc.01298_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>). I am just as well pleased, &amp; glad the Lippincott
      project<sup><a href="#loc.01298_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> is not abandoned, too. I think Traubel's
      paper just the place for it. I always think more lightly of these little
      truth=telling papers than of the big lying, or at least conventional journals.
      Glad to hear always of yr health, Walt, or rather no health. My mind is fallow now,
      but I suffer it is for the best. I hardly know my old self as seen in my old Index
      articles. However, Sursum! Resurgam! Forward! Am reading a pocket Shakspere, <u>nothing</u> like a pocket ed. of a writer.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I do a good many editorial jottings and review Belmont theatricals always for
      Transcript. We have had a magic ice-spectacle here—trees all candied.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
