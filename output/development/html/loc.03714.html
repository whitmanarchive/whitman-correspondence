      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Our good friend William D. O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> died this morning about 2
      o'clock.
   </p>
   
   <p>I doubt not that you will have been informed by his friends, or by the press, but
      as
      it was my lot to be closely associated with him for several months before
      he was forced to keep to the house, and as he often talked of you (I know from your
      books that you loved him, and I know that he loved you), I am impelled to write you
      the sad intelligence of the morning.
   </p>
   
   <p>He seemed hopeful through the last weeks of his illness, but did not fear the End.
      He
      had often said to me that his greatest fear was years of bedridden
      lingering—such as sometimes accompanies maladies kindred to his. Often he quoted:
      "Come quickly, O beautiful
      Death!" and now that it has come we cannot wish him back to that
      shattered tenement of clay.
   </p>
   
   <p>Peace to his ashes!</p>
   
   <p>I have not seen you, Walt Whitman, but it is not necessary to see you in order to
      know you, and I send you my love
   </p>
