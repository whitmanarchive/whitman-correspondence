      <br></br><br></br>To Walt Whitman Poet
      <br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr. Marvin  has given me a
      prospectus stating that a new Edition of your works is about to be published by
      yourself in three 
      vols.
      
       and that the price of the set will be ten Dollars. Wishing to have these
      books and also to contribute a trifling amount towards the promulgation of such
      works of genius as do honor to our country &amp; to humanity, I enclosed twenty
      Dollars which I hope you will accept in payment for <u>one</u> set of the books
      &amp; as a token of my best wishes for the succe≈øs of your enterprise and for
      the speedy restoration of your health that you may be able to continue your
      contributions to the literature of our country both in prose &amp; Poetry and also
      that you may yet enjoy the satisfaction of a full appreciation of their merits
   </p>

      With great respect
      <br></br>I am yours truly
