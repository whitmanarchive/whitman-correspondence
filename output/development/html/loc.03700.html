      <br></br><br></br> Dear Sir:— 
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Spending a few weeks in Merchantville, in "the leafy month of June," I took
      occasion, one bright Sunday morning, to call and pay my respects to you. I had
      previously, on visiting Philadelphia, two or three times taken the same liberty
      and enjoyed the same pleasure; once with my friend E. J. Loomis, of the Nautical
      Almanac Office. For you had yourself, in certain "Messenger Leaves," extended an
      invitation to persons unknown to you to hail you and exchange a few words with
      you, if they felt an impulse so to do. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
      "Stranger! if you, passing, meet me, and desire to speak to me, why should
      you not speak to me, why should you not speak to me? And why should I not speak
      to you?"
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Had I received such a Leaf in Washington, years ago, where I often saw you, I
      think I should have hailed you and wished you w[
      <span class="unclear">ell?</span>]
      , 
      even in the public street; for I even then desired to speak to you. I remember that
      once, taking a stroll
      over the hills beyond the Anacostia, I gathered a small bunch of wild-flowers,
      and, on returning home, finding you seated in the same car, I was impelled to
      offer you the little bouquet—a spontaneous, simple tribute to "the good
      gray poet"—which you accepted very courteously, with thanks. 
   </p>
   
   <p> On my last visit to you, I was glad to see you so, apparently, much better in
      health than I had anticipated finding you. Though you expressed yourself as
      calmly and patiently awaiting the summons to "emigrate" into the great Unknown,
      I hope that the summons may be deferred for may years to come, and that, daring
      them, such vigor of mind and body may remain to you as that life be not a burthen.
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I promised to send you an epigram which on a certain occurrence in 1882—a
      proceeding disgraceful to one of These States—my indignation impelled me
      to pen. I gave a copy of it to your valorous champion, O'Connor,<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup> but I do not
      know whether he ever sent it to you. 
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p> I have a dim remembrance that I also sent it to <u>Puck</u>,
      with a clipping from the <u>Evening Star</u>. I do not think,
      however, that it was ever printed. It may perchance amuse you. At any rate I
      have promised to let you have it, and you will find it transcribed herein. 
   </p>

      I remain, my dear [

      <br></br>very truly, your friend, (if you allow me to call you so,)
      <br></br>[illegible] L. Shoemaker.

   On the attempted Suppression
   <br>of "an American, one of the Roughs, a Kosmos,"
   <br>and "Yawped over the roofs of the world."
   <br>———
   <br>To the District Attorney for Suffolk County, Mass.
   <br>———
   <br>'Tis a most rema[
   <span class="unclear">rk?</span>]
   able want of wit, man—
   <br>The attempt to put down the poet Whitman.
   <br>An attempt to suppress an attorney were better,
   <br>Who thinks the free flight of the soul to fetter.
   <br>Your essay is doomed to ignoble miscarriage.
   <br>An effort to quell youth, love, courtship, and marriage,
   <br>Would be quite as wise. Now, by way of variety,
   <br>Just try it yourself, with you dainty Society;*
   <br>And if you should fail, an absurder sch[
   <span class="unclear">oo?</span>]
    quit, man:—
   <br>What! chain up winged speech, and bold song, and staunch Whitman?
   
   <br>Arrest, if you can, from a bow shot, an arrow,
   <br>And confine and hold steam in a compass to narrow,
   <br>Then thought-check, when once it is printed on paper.
   <br>Far more strong than shot shaft or mere watery vapor,
   <br>Is thought: and when that has set out on its journey,
   <br>It ne'er can be stopped by a District Attorney.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Lukens Shoemaker
      (1822–1906) was trained as a physician but became a philologist, poet, and
      translator; one of his poems ("The Sweetheart Bird-Song") was set to music and
      became a popular ballad in the late 1800s. He visited Whitman in Camden, after
      which Whitman said that he "liked him," describing him as "an old
      man—rather past the age of vigor—but discreet, quiet, not obtrusive"
