   <p>Your welcome letter of 23<u>d</u><sup><a href="#loc.07291_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> came
      to hand this forenoon, also a little bundle of papers which I was glad to get. I
      fear you are having a mighty dull time of it, dear Walt, and I wonder you keep up
      heart
      as you do. Letter from our New York patent lawyer today,<sup><a href="#loc.07291_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      all seems to be going well and I hope to be in Phild. before the middle of Feb. Hope
      so as I want to see you very much and if those friends of yours down there want a
      lecture on W.W. from me I trust to be prepared to give them <u>a
         good one</u> "tho I say it as shouldn't." All quiet &amp; well here. Regular
      spring day today, sun shining bright &amp; warm, we have had <u>no</u> winter yet

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837â€“1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
