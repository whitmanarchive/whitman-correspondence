      My Dear old Friend,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      My best thanks to you for your kind letter written on the back page of one of Dr Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> to you &amp; 
      for JWW's<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r3">3</a></sup> letter to you all of wh came to hand two days ago.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Glad to know that things continue on the better side with you—"the same subject continued,
      perhaps a little 
      <u>plus</u>" says your letter—&amp; I sincerely trust that your discomforts
      
      are really &amp; permanently lessened.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I had a dear good letter from H.L.T.<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup> the other day in wh he says that you "bear your 
      [
      <span class="unclear">world?</span>]
       (not Atlas-like) without a bent shoulder"—a 
      very apt phrase wh exactly pictures you in your old age hearing [
      <span class="unclear">worlds?</span>]
      
      of trouble, distress, pain &amp;c wh. would crush ordinary mortals earthwards. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      What a lesson are you to us all &amp; how thankful we ought to be for all that you have
      been to us!
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      I have had a busy week of it &amp; this has been an exceptionally busy day—two midwifery
      cases &amp; an 
      inquest in addition to my ordinary round of visiting, prescribing, consulting &amp; dispensing
      for heaps of patients— 
      more or less ill &amp; more or less <u>grateful</u> for the services they receive.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      What a tale does my Ledger tell! 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      
      The doctor's an angel of light when we're ill.
      <br>But the devil himself—when he sends his bill!
      <br>Blest is the doctor who gets his fee
      <br>When the tear is ee!
      
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      No news of the clay head yet. I suppose I shall be hearing one of these days. Hope
      it has not 
      been disposed of beyond recovery.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I presume J.W.W. is at Camden now enjoying the hospitality &amp; society of H.L.T. and
      his winsome wife &amp; an occasional talk 
      with you. How I do envy him his good luck!
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      My love to you! Best respects to all your household.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="n6121">3. James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire

   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
