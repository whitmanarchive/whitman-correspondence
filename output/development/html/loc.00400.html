      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yesterday I received your letter of Sunday.<sup><a href="#loc.00400_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I was real glad to hear from you and began to wonder what had happen [to] you &nbsp;About
      the house. I had my plan fixed up as I wanted it and left it with some three or four
      carpenters and got bids on it. much to my astonishment I found that what I was supposed
      would cost at 11 or $1200 could not be done for less than 20 or $2100 &nbsp;after thinking
      the matter over pretty thoroughly I have come to the conclusion that the best thing
      I could do would be to hold on to the lot and wait for cheaper times. I hardly would
      be willing to spend that amount of money in a house of that kind and I think it would be much
      better to wait till the character of the avenue is settled before building. And again,
      I find (by calculation) that the prospect is that the difference in prices in, say
      two years, will more than pay rent for that time and then there would be the interest
      money to pay besides. Dont you think I have acted wisely. I sent word to Blake<sup><a href="#loc.00400_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> word this morning that I would remain as I was and he sent back word that he would
      call and see me this week. That she bitch of Hell, the Brown, is trying her strongest
      to clear us out and I honestly think Walt that I shall just take and belt old Johny<sup><a href="#loc.00400_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> under the eye if he attempts any of his last summers games
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To day the bitch could do nothing better than spend an hour or two in getting the
      lid of the cistern up and has left it in the old dangerous style half on and half
      of[f] the hole &nbsp;Mother tells me that Blake is altogether "on their side" &nbsp;one thing
      is sure that if he attempts any of his games I shall most certainly clear out. I rather
      think that Mother would rather that we would move as Brown is continually at her about
      Mats conduct and keeps her in continued hot water. Everything is going on as usual.
      I wish you would let me hear from you at least twice a week. I guess that I have received
      all your letters &nbsp;Mother got your letter enclosing the $1.00 and is still like Oliver
      Twist.<sup><a href="#loc.00400_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> She has had some 3 letters from you with money in it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We had received the letter from George (that he spoke of in his letter to you) just
      before we got yours<sup><a href="#loc.00400_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> &nbsp;Mother wrote to George also Han yesterday. I wish you would tell George that if
      he cannot possibly get his furlough (if he should make his clothes look awful they
      might let him home to get a new suit) and will send on his measure we will have them
      made in good style and sent to him. As regards the money in the Bank, there is plenty
      left for that purpose. Mother had a letter from Han on Saturday &nbsp;she seemed about
      the same although Heyde wrote in the latter part of the letter that she was not so
      well &nbsp;the exertion of writing was too much for her<sup><a href="#loc.00400_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &nbsp;Sissy is very well and is growing finely &nbsp;She is great on the mischief, she is just
      getting at that age where she does it with "malice aforethoughts"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall write you oftener hereafter &nbsp;I have been so busy with plans specifications
      &amp;c &amp;c that I have not been able to write you as ofen as I would like. I think that I have a good bargain in my lot if I can manage to
      hold on to it. They are now asking $1500 for lots in the immediate neighborhood that
      are not as well located as the one I have bargained for
   </p>
   
   <p>How do you get along with your office hunting &nbsp;do you meet with any encouragement.
      It must be a new life to you. Are you writing for any paper outside of Washington,
      if so what?<sup><a href="#loc.00400_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> You must have pretty good times generally, dont you &nbsp;I should much like to see you for a good talk. Your note book will certainly
      have a good many strange things in it. What are they going to do to reinforce the
      army, will they have to enforce the conscript bill<sup><a href="#loc.00400_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have not been able to send you any money lately but hope that we shall before long.
      do you get any from any other source? Twill be hard for you to go to the Hospitals
      if you cant give the poor young heroes something. I think that it would be a good
      idea for you to write Mr Lane, tell him that you are out, and ask him if he could
      not get the young men around the office to subscribe 50 cts a month.<sup><a href="#loc.00400_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> I will, if he puts "the questions" amend that it be made a dollar, and should not
      wonder that we could send you quite a little sum every month. Of course you wont say
      I suggested it.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all quite well and getting along as well as usual &nbsp;will write you again in
      a few days. Dear Walt receive love from all and a kiss from Hattie

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00400_n1">1. This letter is not
      extant.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00400_n2">2. Unidentified.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00400_n3">3. Jeff refers to John
      Brown and his wife, the neighbors downstairs. See Jeff's letter from .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00400_n4">4. Jeff refers to Oliver's
      famous request for more food: "Please sir, I want some more" (Charles Dickens,
      <em>Oliver Twist</em>, Ch. ii). For another allusion to this
      quotation, see Jeff's letter from .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00400_n5">5. George wrote to Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman on . Walt
      Whitman's letter of about March 1, 1863, is not extant.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00400_n6">6. See the letter from
      Charles and Hannah Heyde to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman of November 24, 1868
      (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and
      Special Collections Library); after Hannah wrote two pages Charles interrupted,
      "here I have interfered and compelled Han to break off—She is too weak to
      continue further." All evidence suggests that the imaginations of both Charles
      and Hannah tended toward the melodramatic.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00400_n7">7. Walt Whitman responded
      on : "Jeff, I wrote a letter to the
      <em>Eagle</em> and sent it yesterday…Look out for it, and buy
      me 20 of the papers." "The Great Washington Hospital" appeared in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> on March 19 (Edwin Haviland Miller,
      ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77], 1:79, n.50). In September Walt Whitman published another
      hospital letter in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Union</em> (<em>Correspondence</em>, 1:95, n.3).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00400_n8">8. Walt Whitman's
      notebooks from this period record the pathetic scenes he witnessed almost daily
      in the hospitals. But as Jeff guessed these notebooks contain other "strange
      things," including the poet's meditation on the adjournment of the
      Thirty-seventh Congress which on March 3, 1863, authorized America's first
      nationwide military draft.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00400_n9">9. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
      and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter of
      , and later various sums which
      Whitman acknowledged in letters from , , , and . In his letter of , Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in the
      Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman wrote,
      obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of money,
      contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly
      through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted Whitman
      in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from , and ). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal welfare that on , he sent through Jeff $5 "for your
      own especial benefit." Walt Whitman did not ask Lane and his employees for more
      money; instead he took a more tactful and indirect approach by instructing his
      brother in a letter from , thus:
      "Jeff, you must give my best respects to Mr. and Mrs. Lane, they have enabled me
      to do a world of good, and I can never forget them.<a href="#r9">[back]
