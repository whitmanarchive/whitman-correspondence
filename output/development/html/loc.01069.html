      Haveing
      
       this morning received a letter from Lieut William Caldwell of our regiment who
      was taken prisoner the same time that Your Brother George was<sup><a href="#loc.01069_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> I write you to let you know that
      Your Brother is still alive and well. I will give you the names of the Officers with
      him
      just as he gave them to me Viz
   </p>
   
   <p>Major Wright, Capt Whitman, Lieuts Ackerson, Tooley, Sims, Waldron, Carberry, Hoyne,
      Groenemyer, Loughsen, Whitbeck, and Murden<sup><a href="#loc.01069_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      he did not say in his
      letter where the men were and I hardly think he knew, or he would a have mentioned
      it.
      He writes that they are short of provisions and requests me to send him a box, if
      nothing more than salt pork and hard tack. So of course they must be pretty hard up
      for
      grub or he would not run the risk of 
      haveing
      
       it sent through the lines. I have sent to Walton to send to Lt. Caldwell a box
      of Stores. And I would say if you could send some to George the same time it would
      come 
      verry exceptable
      
       to him no doubt. I wished I was where I could have a hand in fixing up
      something for my old
      comrade, but here we cannot get anything. So I am going to trust to our friends at
      home
      to look out for all hands.
   </p>
   
   <p>Everything is quiet along our lines except just at this present time it is a raining
      
      verry
      
       hard, which makes it 
      verry
      
       disagreeable for all that are on Picket. but I shall have to bring this to a
      close by Sending my best respects to Your Mother and Your Self hoping to hear from
      you
      soon
