   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00238_n3">1. Whitman is referring to his
      lecture entitled "The Death of Abraham Lincoln," which he delivered in New York
      City on Thursday, April 14, 1887. He first delivered this lecture in New York in
      1879 and would deliver it at least eight other times over the succeeding years,
      delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He had published a version of
      the lecture as "Death of Abraham Lincoln" in <em>Specimen
         Days</em> (1882–83). For more on the lecture, see Larry D. Griffin,
      "'Death of Abraham Lincoln,'" <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, ed. (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 169–170.<a href="#r1">[back]
