   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05105_n1">1. Although no envelope is
      now with the card, Whitman sent books on April 6, 1881, to Albert D. Shaw
      (1857â€“1947), who at the time was the United States Consul in Manchester,
      England; see <em>Daybooks and Notebooks</em>, ed. William White
      (New York: New York University Press, 1978), 1:237. He was the founder and
      editor of the <em>American Review of Reviews</em> from 1891 to
      1937 and author of <em>Abraham Lincoln</em> (1929).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05105_n2">2. Shaw's letter to
      Whitman on March 26, 1881, is apparently lost.<a href="#r2">[back]
