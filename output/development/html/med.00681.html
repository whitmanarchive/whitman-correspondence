   <p>I have run over the Carlyle proof &amp; being in the mood have thought best to mark
      (of course for your consideration—you may have something behind which I do not
      see) <em>out</em> certain passages just as they summarily imprest
      me—clearly though rapidly feeling as I went along that the article would be
      bettered &amp; more unitary without them. What you set out mainly to say &amp; have
      to say, seems to me very well said indeed, &amp; <em>I like the
         article</em>—What you have to offer as the Carlyle-foil, in defence
      of America, I 
      dont
      
       like so well—(besides it is unnecessary any how—Unless one has
      got something outsmashing C himself—a battery-ram that batters <em>his</em> ram to the dust)—
   </p>
   
   <p>Write when you can—Do you want me to send you papers or 
      any thing?—always yours

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="sjs.00019_n1">1. The year is established
      by the following: on March 31, 1883, Whitman noted in his Commonplace Book
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) that he had "read John Burroughs's
      'Carlyle' proof"; on May 20 Burroughs referred to his article to which he was
      "adding a page about Mrs. C. as revealed by her letters" (Syracuse University;
      Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953], 4:510); and the article,
      entitled "Carlyle," appeared in <em>The Century Magazine</em> in
      August, 1883. After writing "Carlyle and Emerson" for <em>The
         Critic</em>, 2 (20 May 1882), 140–141, and an unsigned review of
      Froude's <em>Thomas Carlyle</em> in <em>The Century
         Magazine</em>, 24 (June 1882), 307–308, Burroughs began to gather
      material for a more extended article, as he informed Whitman from London on  (Traubel, 2:171).<a href="#r1">[back]
