   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00590_n1">1. Richard Maurice Bucke dated
      this letter March 28, 1870. Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver cited Bucke's
      date, and Edwin Haviland Miller cited Gohdes and Silver (<em>Faint
         Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em>
      [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 202–203; Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). The date is certain. The letter was
      written after Louisa Van Velsor Whitman was notified of the death of her son
      Jesse Whitman, and it followed a large wind storm that produced substantial
      damage in Brooklyn, New York. Because the day Monday in Louisa's hand is
      consistent with the Brooklyn storm after Jesse's death, the letter dates to
      March 28, 1870.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00590_n2">2. Jesse Whitman
      (1818–1870) died at Kings County Lunatic Asylum on March 21, 1870. Walt
      Whitman was notified of his brother's death (see E. Warner's  letter), and Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman probably received a copy of Warner's letter from Walt. However, Walt's
      March 26?, 1870 letter to Louisa is not extant (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:362). Jesse had suffered from mental illness that included
      threats of violence for several years before he was committed to an asylum,
      where he was placed in December 1864. Shortly after an outburst that followed
      his brother Andrew Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened
      Martha Mitchell and Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff
      sought to "put him in some hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see
      Jeff's  to Walt Whitman). Louisa
      resisted institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her  letter, she "could not find it in
      my heart to put him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings
      County Lunatic Asylum on Flatbush Avenue. For a short biography of Jesse, see
      Robert Roper, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.01011.pdf">"Jesse Whitman, Seafarer,"</a>

   <p id="duk.00590_n3">3. The physician Edwin R.
      Chapin served as the physician at the Kings County Lunatic Asylum on Flatbush
      from 1859 to 1871 (William Schroeder, "Dispensaries, Hospitals, and Medical
      Societies of Kings County, 1830–1860," <em>Brooklyn Medical
         Journal</em> 10 [1896], 127).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00590_n4">4. Edwin R. Chapin remained the
      physician at Kings County Lunatic Asylum, but the letter announcing Jesse
      Whitman's death on March 21, 1870 was signed by assistant physician "E Warner"
      (see Warner's  letter to Walt
      Whitman).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">6. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00590_n6">7. Mattie Whitman visited
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in Brooklyn from February to mid-March in 1870. For
      two of Mattie's letters to Walt Whitman during her visit, see Randall H.
