   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Bethuel Smith, Company F,
      Second U. S. Cavalry, was wounded in 1863. He wrote to Walt Whitman on , from the U. S. General Hospital at
      Carlisle, Pennsylvania, "I left the armory hospital in somewhat of A hurry." He
      expected, he explained on , to rejoin
      his regiment shortly, and was stationed near Washington when he wrote on October
      13. He wrote on , from Culpepper,
      Virginia, that he was doing provost duty, and on , 1864, he was in a camp near Mitchell Station, Virginia,
      where "the duty is verry hard." He was wounded again on June 11, so his parents
      reported to Whitman (August 29), was transported to Washington, and went home on
      furlough on July 1. He returned on August 14 to Finley Hospital, where, on , he wrote to Whitman: "I would like to
      see you verry much, I have drempt of you often &amp; thought of you oftener
      still." He expected to leave the next day for Carlisle Barracks to be mustered
      out, and on  he wrote to Whitman from
      Queensbury, New York. When his parents communicated with Walt Whitman on , Bethuel was well enough to
      perform tasks on the farm. (These letters are in the Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection.) Smith was one of the soldiers to whom Whitman wrote ten years
      later; see Walt Whitman to Bethuel Smith, December 1874 (<em>Correspondence</em>, 2: 318â€“319).
