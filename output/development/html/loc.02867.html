   <p>The 3d July was my rejoicing day, dearest
      Friend,—the day the packet from America reached me scattering for a while the
      clouds of pain and humiliation &amp; filling me through &amp; through with light
      &amp; warmth; indeed I believe I am often as happy reading as you were writing your
      Poems. The long new one "As a Strong Bird" of itself
      answers the question hinted in your preface &amp;  nobly fulfils the promise of its opening
      lines. We want again &amp; again in fresh words &amp; from the new impetus &amp;
      standpoint of new days the vision that sweeps [
      <span class="unclear">ahead,</span>]
       the tones that fill us with
      faith &amp; joy in our present share of life [
      <span class="unclear">&amp; work—</span>]
       prophetic of the
      splendid issues. It does not need to be American born to believe &amp; [
      <span class="unclear">passionately rejoice in the
         belief</span>]
       of what is preparing in America. It is for humanity. And it
       comes through
      England. The noblest souls the most heroic hearts of England were called to be the
      nucleus of the race that (enriched with the blood [
      <span class="unclear">&amp; qualities of</span>]
       other races &amp;
      planted down in the new half of the world reserved in all its fresh [
      <span class="unclear">beauty</span>]
       &amp;
      exhaustless riches to be the arena) is to fulfil justify outstrip the vision of the
      Poets, the quenchless [
      <span class="unclear">aspirations of all the ardent</span>]
       souls that have ever struggled
      [
      <span class="unclear">forward upon this
         earth.</span>]
      
       For me, the most
      precious page in the book is that which contains the Democratic Souvenirs. I respond
      to that as one to whom it means the life of her Soul. It comforts me very much. You
      speak in the Preface [
      <span class="unclear">of
         the</span>]
       imperious &amp; resistless [
      <span class="unclear">command from within out of which</span>]
      
      "Leaves of Grass" [
      <span class="unclear">issued.</span>]
       This carried with [
      <span class="unclear">it no doubt</span>]
       the secret [
      <span class="unclear">of a corresponding resistless
         power over the reader wholly</span>]
       unprecedented, [
      <span class="unclear">unapproached in literature,
         as</span>]
      I believe, &amp; [
      <span class="unclear">to be compared</span>]
      
       only with that of
      Christ. I speak out of my own experience when I say that no myth, no "miracle"
      [
      <span class="unclear">embodied
         the</span>]
       notion of a direct communication between God &amp; a human
      creature, goes beyond the effect, soul &amp; body, of those Poems [
      <span class="unclear"> on me:</span>]
       &amp; that
      were I to put into Oriental forms of[
      <span class="unclear"> speech</span>]
       what I experienced it would
      read like one of those old "miracles" or "myths. [
      <span class="unclear">Thus</span>]
       of many things that used to appear
      to me incomprehensible lies, I now  perceive the germ of truth &amp; understand that what was called
      the supermantural was merely an inadequate &amp; too timid way of conceiving the
      natural.—Had I died the following year, it would have been the simple truth to
      say I died of joy. The doctor called it nervous exhaustion falling with tremendous
      violence on the heart which "seemed to have been strained": [
      <span class="unclear"> &amp; was much
         puzzled</span>]
       how that could have come to pass. I left [
      <span class="unclear">him in his puzzle—but
         it</span>]
       was none to me. How could such  a dazzling radiance of light flooding
      the soul, suddenly kindling it to such an intense life, but put a tremendous strain
      on the vital organs? [
      <span class="unclear">how
         could</span>]
       the muscles of the heart suddenly grow adequate to such new
      work—O the passionate tender gratitude [
      <span class="unclear">that flooded</span>]
       my
      breast, the yearning that seemed to strain the heart
      beyond endurance that I might repay with all my [
      <span class="unclear">life &amp; soul &amp; body this
         debt</span>]
      —that I might give joy to him who filled me with such joy, that
      I might make his outward life sweeter &amp; more beautiful  who made my inner life so divinely sweet
      &amp; beautiful. But, dear Friend, I have learnt to see that this is not to be so,
      now: that for me too [
      <span class="unclear">love
         &amp; death</span>]
       are folded inseparably together: Death that will renew my
      youth. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have had the paper from Burlington —with the details [
      <span class="unclear">a woman likes so</span>]
       to have. I wish I had
      known for certain whether you went on to Boston &amp; were enjoying the music there.
      My youngest boy has gone to spend his holiday with his
      brother in South Wales &amp; he writes me such good news of Per., that he is "looking as brown as a nut &amp;  very jolly" &amp; his home in a "clean
      airy old farm house half way up a mountain in the midst of wild rough grand scenery,
      &amp; the sea in sight near enough to hear the sound of it about as loud as the
      rustling of "leaves"—so the boys will have a good time together, and the girls
      are going with me for the holiday to their grandmother at Colne. W. Rossetti does not take
      his till October this year. I suppose it will be long &amp; long before this letter
      reaches  you as you
      will be gone to California [
      <span class="unclear">—may it</span>]
       be a time full of
      enjoyment—full to the brim.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
