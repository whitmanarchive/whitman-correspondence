      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thinking of you and wondering how your Christmas was spent has tempted me to write
      a
      few lines to you to-night. We all spent that day very happily with [illegible], New Years day we expect them to
      spend with us. How nice it would be if you could join us. I don't know whether any
      of the folks at home will be able to come over or not. Van<sup><a href="#n0883" id="r1">1</a></sup> or
      Ed<sup><a href="#n0589" id="r2">2</a></sup> may come but Pap does not go out a great deal since his
      illness. He does not improve as rapidly as we would like to have him. [illegible] was pretty well for her when we were home last.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are all well excepting the baby who has quite a sever cold at present.</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>We do not expect to remain here another year. Harry<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r3">3</a></sup> has made
      application to the R. R. Co, but has not received much encouragement yet. I suppose
      you have heard of Mont's<sup><a href="#n0910" id="r4">4</a></sup> removal to Elwood N. J. He is quite
      well pleased with his new home.
   </p>
   
   <p>Please accept my thanks for the $2 which you sent the children.</p>
   
   <p>I hope this letter will find you in good health and spirits. With best wishes and
      love from us all I say good night.
   </p>

   <p id="n0590">3. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
