   <p>I have your welcome letter of 9th.<sup><a href="#loc.07255_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> enclosing slip re Osler.<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r3">3</a></sup> I am
      rejoyced to see by your letter that you are keeping so, so—not going back any,
      at all events, I judge. I have had a bad time with Inspector and other botherations
      but it is all over now for the present thank heavens. A very few days will wind up
      my report and then I should be comparatively free. Wm Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r4">4</a></sup> is with me, he goes to
      N.Y. next Monday—I to follow as soon as patents all safe and we shall both
      proceed at once to Phila. Way things look now I do not expect to get away for the
      East untill nearly or quite the end of the month.  I have had short allowance of sleep
      lately—<u>not</u> insomnia but late to bed. last night
      I turned in at 8 and slept 10 hours without waking—pretty good wasn't it?
      Today feel first class. I send you with this a photo of self. Let me know how you
      like it. I don't agree with McKay<sup><a href="#nyp.00580_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> as to cover of
      "N.B."<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r6">6</a></sup> I like it—don't believe <u>his</u> will be as good. Am glad you are at the
      autographing—guess I shall be with you before the big book<sup><a href="#n6137" id="r7">7</a></sup> issued? It takes a
      lot of work to get out such an ed. as that but it will be a big thing when
      done—guess it will be the sacred text by &amp; by. The 1st Folio of S. is
      valuable but I guess after a little that autograph "C.W." of W.W. will lead it in
      the market. Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r8">8</a></sup> forwarded me O'C's<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r9">9</a></sup> letter to you of the 5th. He is a
      grand fellow that the grandest of all your friends—a hero.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4302">3. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on
      Osler, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitman-dev.unl.edu/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_202.html">Osler, Dr. William (1849–1919)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4284">4. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="nyp.00580_n3">5. David McKay
      (1860–1918) was a Philadelphia-based publisher, whose company, founded in
      1882, printed a number of books by and about Walt Whitman in the 1880s and
      1890s, such as the 1891/1892 editon of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>,
      Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em>, and Richard Maurice Bucke's
      1883 biography of the poet.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n3999">6. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n0129">8. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n2002">9. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
