   <p>Sir, I will have 150 (not 50 nor 100) copies bound<sup><a href="#med.00846_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> in the style I like—as sample.—I
      send 100 autograph sheets—(50 were sent before.) I send 100 labels—(50 were sent
      before.) The sample made up is herewith—partly as sample which all copies will be
      compared strictly by—and partly to put in <em>the right page for "Specimen Days" title
         back'd with the copyright line</em>, wh' in present is out (the printer's fault)
      endangering our copyright. Please see the right ones get in these copies.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Frederick Oldach was a German
      bookbinder whose Philadelphia firm bound Whitman's <em>Complete
         Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), a volume that included a profile photo of the
      poet on the title page. The nearly 900-page book was published in December 1888.
      For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
