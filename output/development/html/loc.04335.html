   </p>
   
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">I thank you very much for sending me a proof of your
      article on "Poets." Had you not done so, I should have been compelled to have
      brought out the Christmas number of the REVIEW OF REVIEWS—a copy of which I
      send you herewith—without any extract from the "North American Review." The
      parcel of "North Americans" which ought to have reached London, was lost between
      Liverpool and London, and I have not to this day seen a copy of the Review.
   </p>
   
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">Might I hope for the privilege of an autograph portrait of
      yourself, with a word of suggestion, criticism, or approval of the REVIEW OF
      REVIEWS? Next year I am going to acclimatize the REVIEW in the New World, and a word
      of welcome from you would be most useful.

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Thomas Stead
      (1849–1912) was a well-known English journalist and editor of <em>The Pall Mall Gazette</em> in the 1880s. He was a proponent of
      what he called "government by journalism" and advocated for a strong press that
      would influence public opinion and affect government decision-making. His
      investigative reports were much discussed and often had significant social
      impact. He has sometimes been credited with inventing what came to be called
      "tabloid journalism," since he worked to make newspapers more attractive to
      readers, incorporating maps, illustrations, interviews, and eye-catching
      headlines. He died on the <em>Titanic</em> when it sank in
      1912.
