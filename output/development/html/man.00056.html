      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman
      <br></br>Dear Friend &amp; Guide—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was about to make another effort to find you,<sup><a href="#n3018" id="r1">1</a></sup> to talk over the project I wanted
      your advice about (the Foreign Newspaper correspondence) when lo! to-day I
      notice a few lines in the N.Y. <u>Tribune</u> to say you were
      in <u>Canada</u> (not Camden) and intended to remain North some
      time: then that you intended traveling to the Far South. Thinking the <u>Register</u> would not be as likely as a letter to catch
      you, in these flittings, I have enclosed proofs of pieces I mentioned to you
      recently.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If you get time for composition in your Summer pilgrimages, and have anything you
      think it worth while to say to us "Farmers", I would be glad to have the same.
      As such things must help your income to some extent—please write with the
      piece the amount,—and I will forward 
      chk
      . Don't hesitate, please, to set a price, for I am only too happy to in
      some way to be an instrument in handing forth your Thought. Have you the Lecture
      on Elias Hicks<sup><a href="#n0301" id="r2">2</a></sup> in such shape that you can &amp; will deliver it before an
      assemblage. When you return, and can come to see me, &amp; visit awhile, think I
      can get a <u>paying</u> audience to our large Hall to hear
      &amp; see you. And we being Hicksite Friends, the lecture on Hicks would be the
      theme of greatest interest. Think over this, please, and try to favor us with
      delivery of this Lecture on Hicks.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well the Chicago Convention has ended &amp; politics must have a lull of
      reaction, till the tongues of the talkers have a rest. The Greenbacks meet
      to-day; and soon the Democrats, to make Presidential ticket.
   </p>
   
   <p>The clatter &amp; chatter of "patriots" will be soon like unending "Sound of
      revelry by night."—till they get their offices secure! Then "the
      Country'll be Safe".
   </p>
   
   <p>I spoke in the paper something favorable to Blaine,<sup><a href="#n1015" id="r3">3</a></sup> gave a sketch of this
      Editor-politician, and a portrait. Sent copy to the Senator, and there was a
      prompt 
      responce
      
       of the White 
      Plume
      
       Knight, Blaine sending me a very pleasant letter of thanks. He seems a
      people's favorite—but the politicians—such as Conkling<sup><a href="#n1016" id="r4">4</a></sup>—are
      jealous.
   </p>
   
   <p>But how far below the Calm, Clear Atmosphere of <u>Contemplation</u> and Soul <u>Repose</u>—that you know—is this jarring discord—Politics!
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Tennyson,<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r5">5</a></sup> in his last poem "De Profundis" shows that his inclination is to become the <u>mystic</u> in his riper years. So it is with the author of "Adam Bede" (she reported Married
      lately), her "Theophrastus Such" I have just been reading<sup><a href="#n1014" id="r6">6</a></sup>—filled with "wise Laws."
   </p>    
   
   
   <p>What has become of that excellent &amp; very handsome <u>Radical Review</u>? I have first few 
      
      Nos.
      
       Then it stopped coming—Failed? The best magazine sketch I had
      seen in any periodical, was the critical biography &amp; essay of—<u>Walt Whitman</u> in its Pages. My copy was loaned round,
      till I fear it is lost. Hope you have a copy. If not I will try to secure one
      for you. The review article about yourself was fair &amp; just
   </p>
   
   <p>—If this letter ever overtakes such a traveler as you are, I will hope to
      get a line in reply—if time &amp; inclination permit.

   ———
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">In this column we give, from the Phila. <em>Press</em>, a letter
      from Dr. Bucke that, in justice to our Good Gray Poet, should be widely
      circulated. Scribblers are too prone to attack every man or woman who exhibits
      the least originality,—with about the same reason that the crows display
      in pecking to death one of their kind happening to have a white feather or other
      peculiarity unlike the persecutors themselves. Intolerance of religious belief
      has the same petty and malignant origin,—I am better and holier than
      thou, so go to, and be damned to everlasting torments!
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">We have known Walt Whitman the poet, and found him ever gentlemanly in demeanor,
      cleanly in habits and careful in his dress—not flaunting a red, open
      shirt, and wearing a tarpaulin hat as has been asserted by 
      him
      
       enemies. Even in his younger days, there is the best of evidence that
      his habits were correct, and his conversation ennobling—as became one to
      whom was entrusted by his Creator the sacred fire of genius. If he had been
      ill-dressed and low-minded, it is hardly probable that the beloved poet, William
      Cullen Bryant, should have made young Whitman his bosom companion. Often the two
      youthful poets, while engaged in New York or Brooklyn printing offices, before
      or after working hours met to take long walks together, so that by sweet
      converse amid the beauties of nature, there might be satisfied that longing each
      possessed for the poetic and prophetic afflatus, to unravel the 
      mystires
      
       of Life or Death.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">When Walt Whitman began writing his peculiarly original poems, one of the first
      to give cordial recognition and praise was the philosopher Emerson. Charles
      Sumner, too, gave Whitman, unasked, the warmest commendation, as writer of the
      grandest dirge upon the lamented Lincoln ever composed. We have evidence, as
      well, that our New Jersey poet is a profound thinker upon religious and moral
      themes. One of his very latest compositions is a lecture upon Elias Hicks, one
      the great lights of modern Quakerism. But to hear some ignorant fellows talk
      about Walt Whitman, one would think him a nasty and eccentric old lunatic;
      instead of the quiet gentleman and the poet and thinker that he is.
   </p>
   ———
   
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">WALT WHITMAN.—Dr. Bucke writes thus to the Phila. <em>Press</em> of late date:
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">"Your report in to-day's paper of Colonel Ingersoll's Tuesday evening lecture,
      on "What Shall I Do to be Saved?" is interspersed every second or third
      paragraph with "Amen from Walt Whitman," the poet's name appearing in this
      manner in the long report and introduction some eight or ten times. It was
      at my invitation that Mr. Whitman went to the lecture, and I sat at his side
      throughout its delivery. He neither uttered the "Amen" which the reporter
      puts so often in his mouth, nor once made any sign whatever, either by voice
      or hand, of approval or disapproval, but maintained his usual
      undemonstrative manner throughout. The "Amens" were uttered by a person
      immediately to the left of Mr. Whitman; the mistake was therefore a natural
      one.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">While I am about it, would you give me room to correct "The Genesis of Walt
      Whitman" in <em>Appleton's Journal</em>—not the
      malignance and falsehood of the
      whole article, but a small specimen brick. The <em>Journal</em> speaks of Walt Whitman as habitually wearing, while living
      in New York, a red flannel shirt, a blouse and a tarpaulin hat. It doesn't
      seem to me to matter if he did; but the fact is, he never in his life donned
      either of those articles. Whitman always dressed about the same as he does
      now.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">Another: Not long since the <em>Inquirer</em> of this city
      published a lengthy article on cremation, giving interviews with prominent
      men and their views on the subject—among the rest a long string
      purporting to come from Walt Whitman. A day or two after the poet received a
      letter from the author of the article, saying that as he had been pressed for
      time he had taken the liberty to manufacture and print a set of opinions for
      Walt Whitman without consulting him—and hoped to be excused!
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">Then one more: I am informed that an elderly, full-bearded, gray haired artist
      has for years been frequenting the barrooms and hotels of this city, his
      chums introducing him to strangers as "Walt Whitman," he being always ready
      to take a drink in that character!
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">You might say that such mistakes and "roasts" are not very important, and, at
      all events, get rectified in time. But they don't—not by any means—always; <em>they often make so-called history.</em>
      Walt Whitman himself laughs at them as merely amusing, but they are very
      painful to his friends, who are more in number and warmer than perhaps is
      generally suspected, and, as one of these, I write you this letter, which I
      hope you will have the kindness to insert."
   </p>
   
   
   ———
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">In justice to the Phila. <em>Inquirer</em>, we must state
      that this excellent newspaper had nothing to do with getting up the bogus
      interview with Walt Whitman recently about "Cremation" (mentioned elsewhere)
      except that with other matter it was purchased from the reporter and printed
      upon faith. The intemperate scribbler who got up, "out of his own head," the
      so-called interview, had become a slave of rum, and was fast sinking from an
      honored position on the reportorial staff of the newspaper. Since the hoax
      was printed this reporter has died from effects of his dissipation.

   <p id="n3018">1. William Taylor was the editor of
      the Woodstown (N.J.) <em>Constitution</em> (Whitman's Commonplace

      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0301">2. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker from Long
      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his

   <p id="n1015">3. James G. Blaine (1830–1893)
      was a Republican presidential candidate in the 1880 election. James A. Garfield
      eventually won the party's nomination during the 1880 Republican convention in
      Chicago and named Blaine Secretary of State after taking office in 1881.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1016">4. Roscoe Conkling (1829–1888)
      was a Republican New York senator from 1867 to 1881. He was a fierce supporter
      of President Ulysses S. Grant and strongly opposed James G. Blaine's potential
      nomination as the Republican candidate for the 1880 presidential election. He
      was greatly displeased with Blaine's eventual promotion to Secretary of State
      under President Garfield. This created a rift between Conkling and Garfield
      which ended in Conkling's resignation from the Senate.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n0625">5. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r5">[back]
