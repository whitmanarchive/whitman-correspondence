      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>Your letter of the 15th with the 'Additional Note' was not long in following the
      other,<sup><a href="#uva.00489_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; with it the 'Specimen Days' vol. is now
      splendidly complete.<sup><a href="#uva.00489_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> As the book stands now, there is a native unity about it, more
      I think than when it was given together with the 'Democratic Vistas.' These later
      parts of the original 'S. Days &amp; Collect' will follow naturally as the more
      theoretic exposition of your life &amp; thought, prepared for effectively &amp; made
      so of greater effect, it seems to me. With the D. Vistas completed<sup><a href="#uva.00489_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> in turn, my cup
      will be overflowing indeed. It is something I think of enthusiastically that soon
      they will both be in the hands of the gay fellows everywhere, whose energies will
      presently be master of the spirit of the time. And what you have added to the book
      is so exactly what was wanted to give it direct appeal to us here, &amp; bring it into
      touch.
      Personally I cannot say how grateful I feel for these gifts you have made me the
      almoner of. As for the 'Democratic Vistas,' I hope you will be able to let us have
      some of the essays &amp; papers that have appeared in the Critic &amp; other
      publications, to add to it. As you know, the copy we have now by us is hardly enough
      to make a full volume. You shall be duly apprised of the publishing details, of both
      vols. as time goes on. We propose an interval of four  to six or eight months between the
      2 vols. so that there is plenty of time to settle about the 2nd. Already the news
      that
      you have published additional matter to the 'Specimen Days in America' has excited
      great interest among those who know you here.
   </p>
   
   <p>I told you I was going to see Mrs. Costelloe<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> the other
      evening. Count Stenbock<sup><a href="#n3135" id="r5">5</a></sup> arrived here in a fast hansom in his
      usual erratic way, &amp; whirled me off there about nine o'clock, &amp; we had 'a
      good time' then till midnight, including the brewing of a wassail bowl 
      (non-alcoholic) with comic result by Steinbock &amp; an American girl who was there.
      Mrs. Costelloe impressed me most delightfully. She is one of the five or six noblest
      women I have come across; I say this quite deliberately. I would give a great deal
      to be able to meet &amp; talk with such an one often, &amp; I am sorry that the C's
      are going away to the country for Easter for my own sake; though on the other hand
      it
      is a sin that such a superb creature should be cooped up in a place like London,
      under society restrictions at all, &amp; as she is nearing the time of motherhood,
      one ought only to be glad at her escape to the fields &amp; flowers &amp; free air.
      Costelloe<sup><a href="#n6114" id="r6">6</a></sup> himself is of too <u>hard</u>
      an intellectuality I am afraid, to give us much in common, but I get on with almost
      everybody, &amp; I can see that he is at any rate a very genuine &amp; capable
      fellow in his way.—By the by Mrs. C. shewed me two portraits of you which I
      had not seen before, &amp; she told me to ask you for a copy of one, called by her
      the <u>King Lear</u> one. She said  she would tell you about it in her
      next letter. Before we came away, she read out your preface to the assembled little
      company of guests—mainly Americans, &amp; it was received with enthusiasm, for
      besides its own natural effect she read it very impressively. Curiously enough Roden
      Noel<sup><a href="#n0815" id="r7">7</a></sup> had been there the same afternoon. I go down to dine
      with him occasionally at his place near the Crystal Palace. He is very sympathetic
      with L. of G. Costelloe was rather making fun of him from Mrs. C's description,
      because he accepted Hegel &amp; spiritualism &amp; sundry other paradoxical
      positions on thought. There is a fine fund of manhood in Noel though. He is better
      on the sea-shore than in his study, where indeed he is rather apt to grow
      unprofitably vague over questions of poetry &amp; philosophy, which is to say Roden
      Noel &amp; Hegel chiefly.
   </p> 
   
   <p>I had a piece of rather awkward news about W.S. Kennedy's<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r8">8</a></sup> book<sup><a href="#duk.00813_n1" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      this morning. After writing many times in vain to Wilson,<sup><a href="#loc.03316_n2" id="r10">10</a></sup> I had a note from his
      brother to say that he is ill again, &amp; cannot arrange about the book at present,
      returning it to me accordingly. It is very unfortunate indeed, for it is very
      difficult to get a book of unconventional character afloat in the cockney world of
      publishers. There is some chance of Wilson's being able
      to take the book in the autumn, but that is such a long time to wait.<sup><a href="#uva.00489_n4" id="r11">11</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Spring has fairly set in here at last. I hope it is the same with you. I have many
      a
      good ramble far &amp; wide here, &amp; there is much to see on the riverside always.
      They are building a new bridge (Battersea Bge) close by, &amp; I often go &amp;
      watch them at their pile-driving &amp; so on. The thump of the monkey on the piles
      goes on night &amp; day; after dark they have an electric light which sends a fine
      gleam across here. But it's [
      <span class="unclear">short?</span>]
      -time, &amp; 
      I must stop for to-day. Goodbye!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <p id="uva.00489_n3">2. Rhys mentioned on  that separate publication of <em>Specimen
         Days</em> and <em>Democratic Vistas</em> was about to be considered by the publisher Walter Scott. Whitman noted sending to
      Rhys a two-page preface to <em>Specimen Days</em> on March 8 and
      an "Additional Note" on March 15 (Whitman's Commonplace Book [Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.]). Rhys here notes the receipt of the "Additional Note."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="uva.00489_n1">3. Rhys is referring to the UK

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">4. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="n0815">7. Roden Noel (1834–1894) was an
      English poet. Noel came from an aristocratic English family, and in his youth
      developed socialist sympathies. He was a close friend of the poet and
      influential critic Robert Buchanan, and it may have been through Buchanan that
      Noel first encountered <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In 1871 (the same
      year that he first wrote to Whitman). Noel published an essay entitled "A Study
      of Walt Whitman" in <em>The Dark Blue</em> (Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in England</em> [Ithaca, NY: Cornell University
      Press, 1934], 147–149).<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="n3039">8. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
