   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00408_n1">1. Heyde's extant letters from
      the month of October 1888 are dated the 19th and 27th. Given that he wrote the
      present letter on a Sunday, we can safely eliminate the Sundays (the 21st and
      28th) falling closest to these two letters. The most likely date of composition
      is either the 7th or 14th of October, 1888.<a href="#r1">[back]

      to John Brooks Wheeler, <em>Memoirs of a Small-Town Surgeon</em>
      (Garden City, New York: Garden City Publishing Company, 1936), 284–289,
      Thayer performed most of the operations in Burlington during the 1860s; "he kept
