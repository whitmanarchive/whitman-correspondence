   <p>I am reading Cooper's "Leatherstocking Tales"<sup><a href="#n4173" id="r2">2</a></sup> over again—have not looked at
      them for at least 25 years—did not think they were so genuine and good as I
      find them now to be. We had no 
      clergiman
      
       this morning and I have just come in from officiating—reading
      prayers, bible, sermon &amp;c. Since coming from chapel I have spent half an hour
      (as I often do) running over "November Boughs"<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r3">3</a></sup> "The Voice of the Rain," for
      instance, one of the most exquisite parables in the English, or any other language.
      "Robert Burns," I think, a marvellous piece of criticism. "Last of the War Cases"
      one of your most touching pieces, and so on turning the leaves and thinking and
      dreaming.
   </p>
   
   <p>I thought that by this time I should have been able to say something definite about
      my jaunt east, but I cannot. Wm Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r4">4</a></sup> has been in N.Y. since Tuesday morning.  but so far I have heard
      no word from him—I fear something is wrong but cannot think what it
      is—probably it is nothing serious and when I do hear in a few days more the
      hitch may have been then got over. I still hope I may leave here say about two weeks
      from tomorrow (it may possibly be sooner) but I cannot tell whether I shall go
      direct to Philadelphia or to N.Y. first.
   </p>
   
   <p>Our wet weather still continues, it has rained nearly every day since Sept.
      26—the last few days snow with the rain so that the ground has been white at
      times I look for a fine long "Indian Summer" after all this wet, raw, and cold
      weather.
   </p>
   
   <p>The "Complete Works"<sup><a href="#n6137" id="r5">5</a></sup> takes time, a lot of time, but that is all right—<u>take time</u>—enough of it, and have it <u>right</u>—it is worth taking pains about—it will
      be a standard book for many a day—to many and many it will be a sacred, an
      altogether priceless volume—a bible of the bibles—a resumé of them
      all.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4173">2. The Leatherstocking Tales consist
      of five novels featuring the fictional frontiersman Natty Bumppo, written by
      James Fenimore Cooper and published between 1827 and 1841.<a href="#r2">[back]

      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus

   <p id="n4284">4. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
