      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of 22 Nov. reached me the
      other day 
      thro'
      
       Mr. Conway. You no doubt will by this time have received
      the one I addressed to you 2 or 3 weeks ago; but perhaps it may occur to me to
      repeat here some thing said in that letter. I think the most convenient course may
      be for me first to state the facts about my Selection.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Some while back—I suppose before the middle of Sept.—Mr. Hotten
      the publisher told me that he projected bringing out a
      selection from your poems, &amp; (in
      consequence of my review in the Chronicle) he asked whether I 
      wd.
      
       undertake to make the selection, &amp; write any such prefatory matter as I 
      mt.
      
       think desirable. Proud to associate myself in any way with your writings,
      or to subserve their diffusion &amp; appreciation  here, I
      gladly consented.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I at once re-read 
      thro'
      
       your last complete edition, &amp; made the selection. In doing this I was
      guided by two rules—1, to omit <u>entirely</u> every poem 
      wh.
      
       contains 
      passages or words 
      wh.
      
       modern squeamishness can raise an objection
      to—&amp; 2, to include, from among the remaining poems, those 
      wh.
      
       I most entirely &amp; intensely admire. The bulk of poems thus selected is
      rather less than half the bulk of your complete edition; &amp;, before
      my selection went to the printer's hands, I had the advantage of revising it by the
      corrected copy you sent some while ago to Mr. Conway. I also
      added the prose Preface to Leaves of Grass—obtaining 
      thro'
      
       Mr. Conway your permission to alter (or rather, as I have
      done, simply to <u>omit</u>) 2 or 3 phrases in <u>that Preface</u> (only). Thus my selection is a verbatim  reproduction of a good
      number of your poems, unaccompanied by the remainder. There is no
      curtailment or alteration whatever—&amp; no modification at
      all except in these 3 particulars—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>1. I have given a note here &amp; there:</p>
   
   <p>2. I have thought it better, considering the difference of a
      selection from the sum total, to re-distribute the poems into 5
      classes which I have termed—Chants Democratic—Drum Taps—Walt
      Whitman—Leaves of Grass—Songs of Parting:
   </p>
   
   <p>3. I have given <u>titles</u> to many poems
      
      wh.
      
       in your editions are merely headed with the words of the opening line.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>The selection being thus made, I wrote a Prefatory Notice &amp; Dedication Letter;
      &amp; then consigned the whole affair to the publisher &amp;
      printer, somewhere in the earlier days of October. My prefatory matter, &amp;
      something like a third (I suppose) of the poems, were in print before your letter
      of
      1 Nov. addressed to Mr. Conway, reached me; &amp; now
      the Preface to <em>Leaves of Grass</em> is also in print, &amp; I
      fancy the whole thing ought to be completed &amp; out by Xmas, or very soon
      after.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The letter 
      wh.
      
       I wrote you on receipt of yours of Nov. said
      that I was about to consult the  publisher as to dropping the mere selection, &amp; substituting a
      complete edition, only with slight verbal modifications. This however the publisher
      proved unwilling to do, the selection being so far advanced, advertised, &amp;c.
      therefore the selection will come out
      exactly as first put together; &amp; on reflection this pleased me decidedly
      better.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I now proceed to reply to the details of your letter of 22
      Nov.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If any blockhead chooses to call my selection "an
      expurgated edition," that lie shall be on his own head, not mine. My Prefatory
      Notice explains my principle of selection to exactly the same effect as given in
      this present letter; &amp;
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>contains moreover a longish passage affirming that, if such freedom of
      speech as you adopt were denied to others, all the great literature of the whole
      world 
      wd.
      
       be castrated or condemned.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The form of title–page
      
      wh.
      
       you propose
      
      wd.
      
       of course be adopted by me with thanks &amp; without a moment's debate,
      were it not that my own title–page was previously in print: I enclose a
      copy.I
      trust you may see nothing in it to disapprove—as indeed in essentials it comes
      to much the same as your own model. However, I have already written to the
      publisher, suggesting that he 
      shd
      
       decide, according to the conveniences
       of the printing
      arrangements, which of the two shall eventually appear.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In making my selection, I preserved all (I believe <u>all</u>)
      "the larger figures dividing the pieces into separate passages or sections," but did
      not preserve the numbers of the stanzas,—the <u>separation</u> of stanzas, however, continuing as in your edition. I am sorry
      now that I did not meet your preference in this respect, &amp; that the printing has
      already proceeded too far for me to revert to the small numbers now. My wish was to
      get rid of anything of a merely external kind 
      wh.
      
       ordinary readers 
      wd.
      
       call peculiar or eccentric. Parrot–like repetitions  of that change have
      been too numerous already.
   </p>
   
   <p>I need scarcely assure you that that most glorious poem on Lincoln <u>is</u> included in my
      Selection.
      It shall appear with your title "President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn." I had previously
      given it a title of my own, "Nocturn for the Death of Lincoln"; &amp; in my
      Prefatory Notice it is alluded to under that title. A note of
      explanation shall be given.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I await with impatience the receipt of your paper on Democracy. It
      will find in me no reluctant hearer, as I have always been a
      democratic republican, &amp; hope to live &amp; die faithful to the meanings of that
      glorious creed. The other printed
      matter
      you have so kindly sent me I received two evenings back from Mr.
      Conway. The newspaper articles are new to me: with the publications of
      Mr. O'Connor &amp; Mr. Burroughs I was already
      familiar, &amp; I entertain a real respect for those publications
      &amp; their writers.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Believe me, I am grateful to you for your kindness in these matters, &amp; for the
      indulgent eye with which you look upon a project which perhaps, after
      all,
      you 
      wd.
      
       rather had never been entered upon. I am in some hopes that your
      indulgence will not  be
      diminished when you see what the Selection itself actually
      looks like. In consequence of the correspondence 
      wh.
      
       has passed since the selection was made, I may possibly find occasion to
      add a brief P.S.: it shall contain nothing you 
      cd.
      
       object to. If the selection aids the general body of English poetical
      readers to understand that there really is a great poet across the
      Atlantic, &amp; to demand a complete &amp; unmutilated edition, my
      desires connected with the selection will be accomplished.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
