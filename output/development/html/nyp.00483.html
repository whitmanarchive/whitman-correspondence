      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of 14th &amp; proofs of 1883 Letter 
      rec'd—All 
      y'r
      
       marks will be attended to—the Emerson passages put in as you
      desire<sup><a href="#nyp.00483_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—the text minutely adhered
      to—every correction carried out—with the single exception (if you will
      allow it, as I personally request you will) of restoring the italic non-quoted
      names of books, &amp;c. The typographical plan was laid out by the Superintendant in the
      printing office &amp; agreed to by the publisher &amp;
      myself—I stipulated that your text should be adhered to without the slightest
      variation—but gave in to the type &amp; technique business, so as to have a
      certain system &amp; uniformity which those names as printed come under—But it
      does not involve any material point &amp; I know you will be entirely satisfied when
      you come to see the Letter and the G[ood] G[ray] P[oet] in the printed
      book—Also I request you will allow a few certain ¶ breaks in the G G
      P—not at all affecting the text—but helping the typography &amp;
      reader—I think most decidedly helping<sup><a href="#nyp.00483_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>The foot note (early part of G G P) is printed I see exactly as in copy—If not
      the true note, send it on as you wish, &amp; it shall appear verbatim—(we have
      no fear of scarifying Lowell)<sup><a href="#nyp.00483_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—If the exigencies of
      the printing office allow I will have a revise sent you—but it is not
      certain—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00483_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd March 17/83." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Care Dr W F Channing | 98
      Congdon Street | Providence | Rhode Island | p o box | 393. It is postmarked:
      Camden | Mar | 16 | 12 M | N.J.; Providence | Mar | 17 | 6 AM | R.I.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00483_n2">2. On  O'Connor requested that Emerson's letter
      be printed in entirety (see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953],
      4:406–407).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00483_n3">3. On  O'Connor vehemently opposed any
      alterations in his paragraphs (see Traubel, 4:354–355).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00483_n4">4. O'Connor wanted printed
      exactly the footnote which alluded, without mentioning Lowell by name, to a
      Cambridge author who had termed Whitman "nothing but a low New York rowdy," "a
      common street blackguard" (Richard Maurice Bucke, <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883], 100n).<a href="#r4">[back]
