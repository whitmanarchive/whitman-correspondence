      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of last Sunday &amp; Monday came safe—was glad to see you so cheerful
      &amp; feeling well, as seemed plain by the tone of the letter. All goes right with me.
      I am
      feeling well, &amp; business matters move along as favorably as could be expected, taking
      all things in consideration. The weather is elegant—We had rain here too last Saturday
      &amp; Sunday—&amp; since then it has been clear &amp; bright—I am out dashing
      around every day—fetch up home every night somewhere between 10 &amp; 1 oclock, quite
      tired. The river &amp; bay get more &amp; more beautiful, under these splendid September
      skies, the green waves &amp; white foam relieved by the white sails of the crowds of ships
      &amp; sail craft—for the shipping interest is brisker this fall than it has been for
      twelve years. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01533_n1">1. Henry Hurt, like Doyle, worked for the
      Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company. According to the Washington <em>Chronicle</em> of January 15, 1874, at that time he was the
      treasurer of the company.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01533_n2">2. Henry Shedd, the driver of the streetcar
      (#14) on which Doyle was the conductor.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01533_n3">3. The 1869 Directory listed at the same
      address George A. Bell, a conductor, and Horace Bell, a messenger.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01533_n4">4. Baalam Murdock, a conductor, was mentioned
      in an address book: "went to school several years but with little profit"
      (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #108).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01533_n5">5. The 1869 Washington Directory listed
      George S. Smith, a driver. However, in an entry dated October 13, 1868, in an
      address book (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of
      Congress, Notebook #108), Walt Whitman referred to Smith as a driver on the
      Fifth Avenue "stage" in New York.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01533_n6">6. J. P. Milburn &amp; Co., druggists:
      "Proprietors and Manufacturers of Milburn's Unrivaled Polar Soda Water," and W.
      C. Milburn, either the son or the brother of Dr. J. P. Milburn, a druggist
      mentioned in Whitman's 
      letter to Doyle.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01533_n7">7. Mr. and Mrs. Michael Nash, Washington
      friends to whom Walt Whitman referred frequently in his letters to Doyle. Mr.
      Nash was an old resident of the city; Walt Whitman's  letter to Doyle made mention of a speech Nash gave
      to the Oldest Inhabitants' Association.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01533_n8">8. Perhaps the Rev. F. E. Boyle. An address
      book (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #109), however, listed an A. F. Boyle of Washington, a journalist.
      Whitman mentioned dinner "at a Mr Boyle's" in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0217">9. The New York <em>Times</em> of
      September 15, 1870, reported that the Papal troops were evacuating various towns
      and Papal states. On September 21, 1870, the forces of Italian King Victor
      Emanuel II (1820–1878) entered Rome without bloodshed, after "the Pope
      forbade any resistance." Victor Emanuel, whose reign had been marked by wars of
      Italian unification, established the capital of the newly unified Italy at Rome
      on July 2, 1871.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01533_n9">10. The New York <em>Times</em>
      of September 15, 1870 reported that the Papal troops were evacuating various
      towns and Papal states. On September 21, 1870, the forces of Victor Emmanuel
      entered Rome without bloodshed, after "the Pope forbade any resistance."<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01533_n10">11. G. Swayne Buckley's minstrel troupe
      appeared in Brooklyn in August 1870 in travesties of operas; George Clinton
      Densmore Odell, <em>Annals of the New York Stage</em> (New York:
      Columbia University Press, 1927–1949), however, does not record
      performances in September 1870.<a href="#r11">[back]
