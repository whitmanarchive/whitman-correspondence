      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been too busy to even get time to say <u>thank you</u>, for
      your good letter,<sup><a href="#loc.02984_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; the papers.
   </p>
   
   <p>All are welcome, but I was rejoiced at the good news in your letter to Dr. Bucke,<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; which he quotes in his.<sup><a href="#loc.02984_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I echo <u>his</u> words.
      &amp; hope that you are feeling pretty well this clear cold day.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am very glad you sent me the letter from Dr. Bucke, I will return it later. I have
      been trying to get the house into living order, &amp; the stove is all right &amp;
      burns well since it was repaired. The watercloset had to be seen by the plumbers,
      &amp; they are <u>slow</u>, so it all takes time, but I am getting in order,
      &amp; you know that I did not live in Philadelphia five years for nothing! I have a
      great love of good house keeping, care <u>too much</u> I fear,
      for the trifles.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope that your <u>boys</u> are well, &amp; your house-keeper. I
      was invited out to dine
      yesterday, Thanksgiving day. Last year I had William<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp;
      Harold Channing,<sup><a href="#loc.02984n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> but I think we did not ask any
      guest, William was already so much of an invalid in some ways.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

      of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="loc.00945_n5">4. William F. Channing
      (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
      Whitman stayed at his home in October, 1868.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.02984n3">5. Harold Channing was the
      son of O'Connor's brother-in-law, William F. Channing (1820–1901) and the brother
      of Grace Ellery Channing (1862–1937).
      Harold and Grace were the nephew and niece, respectively, of O'Connor.<a href="#r5">[back]
