      The only evidence, which is hardly conclusive, that this note was sent to the
      Boston <em>Daily Advertiser</em> is the accession record in
      the Houghton Library at Harvard. "As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free" was not
      reprinted in this newspaper. However, on June 27, 1872, a correspondent may
      have used part of Walt Whitman's blurb in his lengthy description of Walt
      Whitman's appearance before the United Literary Society, where he followed
      Edward Everett Hale: "He stood up bravely, but did not fill the entire house
      with his voice. He appeared in his usual eccentric garb, and with a part of
      his brawny breast bared and his long, white, gray hair and tawny beard, set
      out by his Byronic collar, made his head and face a study.<br><br>
      "Mr. Whitman calls his poem the 'thread-voice' or 'the spine' of a new series
      of chants illustrating 'an aggregated, inseparable, unprecedented, vast,
      composite, electric, democratic nationality,' to be published on some far
      distant day in a book, and be a following of his 'Leaves of Grass,' which he
      calls 'the song of a great, complete democratic individual.' He seeks to
      demonstrate that America is to create a new literature, a new poetry, as
      well as new inventions and power, and to show that the poet of the age must
      sing vigorously of work, creation and development to be worthy of a hearing
      in this great epoch. I fear his hearers hardly comprehended his lines, or
      dreamed at what he was driving, and some in my immediate vicinity were so
      ungracious as to comment upon it severely, terming it 'words, words,
      meaningless,' while others characterized it, rather more roughly, 'stuff and
      nonsense.' But at the close of the reading the compliment of hearty applause
      was given it. The day must be considered an eventful one in the career of
      Walt Whitman, for it brought him for the first time within the walls of a
      college and before a college people."<br><br>
      A dispatch to the New York <em>Times</em> on June 29, 1872,
      reported that Walt Whitman "was cordially met by the venerable gentlemen
      sitting upon the platform. He then took his position at the desk and read,
      with clearness of enunciation, his poem, written for the occasion, 'As a
      Strong Bird on Pinions Free.' As Mr. Whitman himself said to the writer,
      'There is no one expression that could stand as the subject of the poem.'"

      1906), 203â€“205.<a href="#r2">[back]
