      Dear Walt,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Thank you for all papers &amp;c. that you have so kindly sent, &amp; especially for the "Poet-Lore"
      with 
      article about William,<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; the Transcript of the 19. with notice of your Lincoln 
      Memorial evening. It is good, &amp; I am thankful that you could go &amp; and do it. Most
      noble
      &amp; fitting; &amp; I wish I could have been there.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      As for me, dear Walt, I feel as if I had been more or less under a cloud, the cloud
      that comes of having to
      give too much thought &amp; care to this world's affairs,— the 
      [
      <span class="unclear">tow?</span>]
       to provide for the food, shelter 
      &amp; raiment of the body. My friends have been trying to get me a place in the Census
      Bureau, but as yet
      without success. I felt that I must hold on to this little home till I could see my
      way somewhat, &amp; I 
      think I have done well in so doing. I hope to be able to have a home still,
      
      &amp; a plan is now under consideration by which I hope to have a home with a friend.
      If it matures I will 
      let you know. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Soon it will be a year since William passed on! The 9th of May, so soon here now,
      &amp; what a long year 
      it has been to me; &amp; yet in another way it seems but yesterday that I watched his
      last hours.— I
      am very sorry to learn that you have been down with the "grip," which we have had
      here.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      You told me that you have, or can get 
       
      all Magazines &amp; papers. Have you seen the "New England Magazine" for <u>March</u> 1890. 
      It has a story "A Strange Dinner Party"— by my niece, Grace Ellery Channing. If you
      get it, &amp; read 
      it, &amp; don't care to keep it, I shall be glad of it. She is writing quite a good deal,
      but says that since 
      her uncle William O'Connor died, she feels that her "literary conscience is gone."
      She also
         
      has published in the "Overland Monthly" but I never see that.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I will send you a little poem of hers, &amp; will like you to return it, as I have no
      other of hers. It was in
      "Kate Field's Washington" of Feb. 12 1890. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      How I wish I could run over &amp; see you! When "my ship comes in," I will. Will it come
      in, in this life?
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I must not forget to tell you that our old lady friend,
           
      Mrs. Johnson<sup><a href="#n0334" id="r3">3</a></sup> died last Wednesday, at the age of 95 years &amp; 4 months! Of old age—the 
      doctor said she had <u>no disease</u>.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I send you, dear Walt a paper that that I promised, with notice of William's funeral.
      Send a postal card to let
      me know get them, please.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      I am alone still, but am to have two young girls with me for six weeks, to board until
      their schools 
      [
      <span class="unclear">done.?</span>]
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      One reason why I have so desired to hold on to a home, is that in the pecuniary distress
      of the 
      Channings<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> if they have to give up their beautiful home in Cal. I may have
       
      a refuge for them here, &amp; so perhaps return in small measure their many benefits to
      us in the time of 
      dear Jeannie's<sup><a href="#n4138" id="r5">5</a></sup> sickness, &amp; again when William went out there. But, dear Walt, I 
      try to keep up a good heart, &amp; not doubt or dispond.
      
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years, and he speaks often in his letters of their daughter Jean, by nickname
      "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break in late
      1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated black citizens,
      Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence between Whitman and
      Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For
      more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see also Dashae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
