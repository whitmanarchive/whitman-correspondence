   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n1027">2. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="loc.03108_n1">3. Whitman is referring to the
      poem ultimately titled "A Christmas Greeting." In his , letter to Richard Maurice Bucke the poet refers to
      the poem as "the little 'Northern Star-Group to a Southern' (welcome to
      Brazilian Republic)." This would become the poem's subtitle: "From a Northern
      Star-Group to a Southern. 1889–'90." See also "," a manuscript draft of this poem.<a href="#r3">[back]

      <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> ($6), <em>Leaves of Grass</em> ($5), and <em>Portraits
         from Life</em> ($3). The advertisement appeared in <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1889);
      a facsimile of Walt Whitman's draft of the circular appears in Horace Traubel,
      <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.53.html">Thursday, May 30, 1889</a>.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.00668_n4">5. Frederick Warren Fritzinger
      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,
      535).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">6. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

   <p id="loc.03012_n1">7. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
