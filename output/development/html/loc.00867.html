   <p>It has been a long time since I have seen or heard from
      you, and I suppose that you have nearly forgotten me, but if you will think back you
      will remember a man by my name, whom you met in Carver Hospital Washington D. C. where
      we met then the first time. I never expected to be able to write you a line in the
      year
      1865, but I have been spared for some other purpose I suppose. And now you will please
      accept my thanks for all the favors that  you have shown me while lying then unable to help myself.
   </p>
   
   <p>Lieut. Babcock<sup><a href="#loc.00867_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> has this morning recd a letter from Lieut.
      Caldwell<sup><a href="#loc.00867_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>. Caldwell and all the rest of our officers are
      in Danville Military Prison Va, he mentions Maj Wright Capt. Whitman Pooley Sims
      Ackerson Waldron Carberry Hoyme Groenemeyer [
      <span class="unclear">Loughson?</span>]
       Whitbeck &amp; Murden, they are all doing well,
      &amp; all they ask for is for something to eat, Hard Bread and Pork, or anything that
      can be sent them, and as it is impossible for us to get them anything how I hope some
      of
      you good people at home will try and do something for them<sup><a href="#loc.00867_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>.
      Lieut Babcock has shown me a memorial of the Old 51st and if you could possiblysend me a few copies I would be very much
      obliged to you for your trouble. Once more allow me to thank you for your kindness
      toward me while in Hospital.
   </p>
   
   <p>Hoping to hear from you soon I remain</p>
