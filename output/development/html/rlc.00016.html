   <p id="rlc.00016_n1">1. Schmidt noted receipt of
      the book on  and his desire to translate
      "The Death of Abraham Lincoln."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="rlc.00016_n2">2. Richard Maurice Bucke
      mentioned receiving Schmidt's book in a letter to Whitman on . In this letter he summed up his
      reactions to <em>Specimen Days</em> in a passage which Whitman
      marked with red ink: "As to S. D. it is a suitable finish up to your work, it is
      what we (those who know something of you) have been wanting for a long time and
      what the future will want still more and will prize far more even than we can
      prize it now—it is all on a low key (as it ought to be) no fine writing
      but plain prose giving the [illegible] just the
      insight that we wanted into your common every day life, and your ordinary every
      day manner of looking at things—I think you may now say that your work is
      done, I do not see any more for you to do at all events though perhaps you will
      see something, when you have had time to look about again a bit."<a href="#r2">[back]
