      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It was a great pleasure to me to see your handwriting (letter of 19
      Oct.)—likewise to make the acquaintance of Mr.
      Marvin, whom we all found most pleasant and
      sensible. The only disappointment was his short sojourn over here: for, as soon as
      he had called on us with your letter (
      wh.
      
       was about 1 Dec., I think) he went over to Paris &amp; then, after
      returning &amp; dining
      with us, another day or two saw him on his way homeward acroſs the Atlantic. I
      dare say he has told you (if opportunity served) something about the evening he
      paſsed with us &amp; a few friends—<u>good
         Whitmanites</u> most of them. Let me see whether I can remember the names. Mr.
      Marvin took down to dinner our dear &amp; admirable friend Mrs.
      Gilchrist (who lately lost her mother, aged more
      than 90, &amp; expects to see her eldest son happily married pretty soon): I found
      Mr. M. was not aware (&amp; perhaps you are not) that Mrs. G. is the widow of a
      literary man of some name, Alex. Gilchrist, author of the Life of
      the Great ideal painter-poet 
      Wm.
      
       Blake, &amp; of the Life of the painter Etty: he died young of a scarlet
      fever in 1861. Next Mr. M. was 
      Jos.
      
       Knight, Editor of the Sunday Times, theatrical critic
      of the athenaeum, &amp;: a man of excellent critical capacity, who knows your value.
      Then Miſs Mathilde Blind, stepdaughter of the German
      revolutionist of 1848, a woman of singular ability &amp; independence of mind, &amp;
      a most earnest believer in the author of Leaves of Graſs. Next, Justin McCarthyJustin McCarthy, one of the foremost writers
      in the Daily News, &amp; a novelist of much talent: he has been more than once in
      America—also his wife. Then my father–in–law 
      
      Madox
      –Brown the historical painter, &amp; his wife.
      Lastly E. W. Goſse &amp; his bride : the former a poet of
      these more recent years, who has done some graceful things, &amp; has much knowledge
      &amp; good perception as a critic: Mrs. Goſse <u>was</u> lately Miſs Ellen Epps ,
      belonging to a family of medical homeopathists, &amp; is herself a painter of no
      ordinary talent. Her sister married a painter of European fame, Alma–Tadema
      , a dutchman now naturalized in England.—But perhaps I am
      peppering my letter with a lot of details that are not much to your purpose. Mr.
      Marvin informed me that your works, in their various forms, are in the
      Congreſsional 
      
      Library
       at Washington, but not my 
      vol.
      
       of selections, &amp; that he 
      wd.
      
       like to see the latter added to the series: so, not having a <u>new</u> copy at hand, I delivered to him my own (not yet
      shabby) copy of the selections, &amp; he will present it to the Library.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My father–in–law has, I know, ordered the publishers (Tinsley Brothers)
      to send you a copy of the Literary Remains of his son, just
      published: the youthful author died rather more than a year ago. I think the book
      will present to you evidences of uncommon faculty. You will see on the
      title–page the names of myself &amp; of F. Hueffer 
      (husband of my wife's
      half–sister) as editors. The memoir however is written <u>principally</u> by the father
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was very glad to see you attended the Edgar Poe
      celebration, from 
      wh.
      
       other men who ought to have been presented were 
      blameably
      
       (I 
      shd.
      
       say) absent: &amp; I read with great interest your printed remarks
      regarding Poe's genius. To me he has always been a fascinating writer—not of
      course that I am blind to his blemishes &amp; perversities: the poem named <u>To Annie</u> is, I think, great—even deserving preference
      above The Raven.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I 
      cd.
      
       say a good deal more: but occupations preſs &amp; I want to get this off
      (28 Dec. now) without further delay. Believe how warmly I &amp; others in this
      country, near or not so near to me, feel regarding you. Are you ever to come to my
      land? &amp; if so 
      w.d
      
       you not house with us for some portion at least of your sojourn?
   </p>

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
