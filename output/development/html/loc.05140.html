      <br xmlns="" class="opener">July 12, 1883.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been so ill, and so burdened with the office charge, being scarcely able to
      hold my head up, that I have too long kept your <u>Critic</u> article, which I return. It
      is splendid. What other American poet has earned, or will ever earn, the proud
      distinction of having an article upon him, like Dr. Popoff's, suppressed by the
      knout-empire!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Did you note how the N. Y. Post (same as the <u>Nation</u>) in itemizing the article, took
      out its essential features. Contemptible wretches.
   </p>
   
   <p>There was a vile review 
      
      of
      Bucke's book in the <u>Nation</u> of July 26. I did not see it until this week, and
      have sent a reply—quiet but scathing—which I hope may get into print.
   </p>
   
   <p>As
      for Mathilde Blind's (Blinnd, they pronounce it, as rhyming to <u>dinned</u>,) report of
      George Eliot's attitude toward 
      L. of G., it is a precious war-weapon, when you consider the immense
      estimation in which George Eliot is held, especially by the enemy (an undue
      estimation, though she certainly was a woman of genius). It is high jinks for us
      when she, whom they are even ranking 
      
      
      with Shakespeare, should put 
      L. of G.
      
       among the few modern books she read, and declare that she found it
      "<u>good for her soul</u>!" This must be wormwood to some of our moral literary
      ghosts—ghosts, indeed, since they have, if you'll believe them, got rid of
      their bodies before death—who are always retching over 
      L. of G., and purring like cats over <u>Adam Bede</u> and <u>Middlemarch</u>. A careful
      advertisement ought to be prepared for McKay, giving a few of the <u>best</u> opinions on 
      L. of G., with this prominent among them. The effect would 
      
      be considerable. How
      poor Sidney Lanier would wince over this testimony! He had a savage (and silly)
      attack on you in his lectures, coupled with sky falutin eulogy of George
      Eliot. To see his idol prostrate in worship before his <u>bete
         noir</u>, would have been a stinger. But, rest his soul! he's dead, and
      gone where he knows what an ass he made of himself.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just read Specimen Days, and seen the splendid compliment you pay me. To be
      remembered in connection with Ossian and on an Ossianic night, is the 
      
      highest
      tribute possible.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The book is all sweet and sane and immortal. When I get well (I am slowly mending)
      I
      am going to read it carefully and slowly—not, as now, with a weak and whirling
      head. I noticed on page 317 what seemed a plate breakage—NOTES LEFT
      OVEP—"ovep" for "over."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Apropos of corrections, I wish, if Bucke's book comes to a second edition, that you
      would substitute something else for the <u>fac simile</u> piece about Garfield's
      assassination. First, because, despite the 
      
      poor fellow's horrible death, he does not
      deserve such commemoration. Garfield was a bad fellow. I knew him well. He was one
      of the worst types of an intriguing politician—personally and politically
      base. His death has canonized him, although the glamor is fading. Any knowing
      politician, who will be confidential with you, will tell you that Dorsey's
      allegations are strictly true. Three or four of them, I myself <u>know</u> to be true. A second reason for suppressing the piece, or relegating
      it to a back 
      
      seat, is that the first line—"The sobbing of the bells"—is
      one of Edgar Poe's best-known verses, original with him too. You will find it
      in "The Bells."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I got the 25 copies from McKay, and will settle soon.</p>
   
   
   <p>I have found that the "office editor" of the N. A. Review is named Metcalf. As ill
      luck would have it, he is away, as Rice is. I have an article there which I am
      anxious to get published, but fear they will reject it. Grant White had a dastardly
      mass of lies and perversions
      
      in the <u>Atlantic</u> in April anent of Mrs. Pott's
      publication of Bacon's <u>Promus</u>—a strong anti-Shakespere document—which
      hurt the book immensely, and my article is a reply in which I take Mr. White's hide
      off, and "hang the calf-skin on his recreant limbs." Although Rice welcomes
      both sides, the Shakespeare prejudice is so strong, that I am afraid of not getting
      a hearing, and I wanted to make things even by bringing a little influence to bear
      on the office editor, in Rice's absence.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am glad you stand so well in Rice's favor, though I am surprised he should have
      rejected your Carlyle article, which seems to me so rich and grand.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wrote to Montgomery by way of attaching him, and had a very cordial and
      friendly reply. He has lots of talent, but a vicious way of
      temporizing—qualifying his statements, which he ought to get over. His
      letter, too, gave me an unpleasant impression of pertness and 
      
      conceit. I fear he is
      an ineradicable sophomore, but he is friendly to us, and we need friends.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wrote to Sloane Kennedy, and had a fine reply. He is a good fellow.</p>
   
   
   <p>Your Santa Fe letter is superb. It strikes a great chord. I have long looked
      with distrust on the Spanish boojum manufactured for us. After all, the true
      Spain—the real, essential Castilian spirit—is in Cervantes. Surely, it
      is not dark and cruel there. Apropos, here's a nice little fact. The Spanish
      Inquisition, according to the indictment of its deadliest enemy, its secretary,
      Llorente, destroyed in 400 years, 30,000 people. The whole
      Protestant world howls and roars, properly enough, over this dreadful record.
      Yes—but in the single reign of Henry the Eighth, Defender of the faith and typical
      Protestant, according to Lord Chief 
      
      Justice Campbell, a Protestant and a Scotchman,
      there were 72,000 people who suffered bloody and violent
      deaths! It is funny that History shrieks over the 30,000 it took 400 years for the
      Inquisition to destroy, and is quite mum over the
      72,000 who perished in the single reign of the English
      Bluebeard. "Give a dog a bad name."
