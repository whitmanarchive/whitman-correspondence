      <br></br>Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hereby respectfully make application for the office of Pardon Clerk, now vacant
      in
      the Department of Justice.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have served in the Department under Attorney Generals Speed,<sup><a href="#nar.03605_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Stanbery,<sup><a href="#nar.03605_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Browning,<sup><a href="#nar.03605_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> Evarts,<sup><a href="#nar.03605_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Hoar,<sup><a href="#nar.03605_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; yourself—am familiar
      with the general routine of the office (am the oldest in continuous service of any
      of the present clerks)—think I could soon learn the special duties of the
      pardon desk—and hope I should conscientiously seek to perform them, both with
      regard to their great official, and still greater moral obligations.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I would refer to Mr. Speed and Mr. Stanbery, Attorneys General, &amp; Mr.
      Ashton,<sup><a href="#nar.03605_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> Assistant Attorney General, under whom I have acted as clerk,
      some of them for several years—and to Mr. Pleasants,<sup><a href="#nar.03605_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> late Chief Clerk—and if
      agreeable to you, or desirable, would bring written testimonials from them.
   </p>

      Very respectfully,

   <p>Should it not be convenient to grant the foregoing application I respectfully ask
      to be promoted to a fourth-class clerkship, to date from 1st. of February,
      1871.<sup><a href="#nar.03605_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>

   <p id="nar.03605_n2">2. James Speed
      (1812–1887) was appointed Attorney General in 1864 by Lincoln; because he
      was opposed to Johnson's policies, he resigned on July 17, 1866.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="nar.03605_n3">3. Henry Stanbery
      (1803–1881) was appointed Attorney General in 1866 by Andrew Johnson but

      Secretary of the Interior in 1866. Browning was appointed Acting Attorney
      General on March 12, 1868. At the conclusion of Johnson's administration, he
