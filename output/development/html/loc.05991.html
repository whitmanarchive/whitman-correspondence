      <br></br><br></br>Mr Whitman
      <br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I received your book and
      photograph, I thank you very much
      indeed for both of them.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I have enjoyed reading your book very much as it gave me a very different
      opinion of the private soldier, from
      that which I before possessed.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I received your book some three weeks
      ago when I was preparing for my half
      yearly examinations and as I was very
      busy I could not get time to read it
      and I didn't want to write until
      I had done so.
      
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours affectionately
      <br></br>William Mills
