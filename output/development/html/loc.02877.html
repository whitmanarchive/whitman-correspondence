      <br></br><br></br>My Dearest Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Are you well and happy and enjoying this beautiful summer? London is, in one sense,
      a
      sort of big prison at this time of year: but still at a wide open window with the
      blue sky opening to me &amp; a soft breeze blowing  in &amp; the Book that is so
      dear—my life–giving treasure—open on my lap. I have very happy
      times. No one hundreds of years hence will find deeper joy in these poems than
      I—breathe the fresh sweet exhilarating air of them, bathe in it, drink in what
      nourishes &amp; delights the whole being, body intellect &amp; soul, more than I.
      Nor could you, when 
      writing them have desired to come nearer to a human being &amp; be more to them for
      ever &amp; for ever than you are &amp; will be to me. O I take the hand you stretch
      out each day—I put mine into it with a sense of utter fulfilment: I ask
      nothing more of time and of eternity but to live and grow up to that companionship
      that includes  all. 
   </p>
   
   <p>6th. This
      very morning has come the [
      <span class="unclear">answer</span>]
       to my question—First I only saw the Poem—read it
      so elate— soared with it to joyous heights, said to myself—he is so
      [
      <span class="unclear">well
         again,</span>]
       he is able to take the journey [
      <span class="unclear">into Massachusetts</span>]
       &amp; speak the
      kindling words—Then I turned over and my joy was dashed. My Darling! such
      patience yet needed along the tedious path! Oh, it [
      <span class="unclear">makes me long</span>]
       with  passionate [
      <span class="unclear">longings,</span>]
       with
      yearnings I know not how to bear, to come, [
      <span class="unclear">to be your</span>]
       loving, cheerful companion,
      the one to take such [
      <span class="unclear">care, to do</span>]
       all for you, to beguile the time, to give you of my
      health as you have done to tens of thousands. I do not doubt either, but that you
      will get well. I feel sure, sure it [
      <span class="unclear">will be</span>]
       given me to see you And perhaps
      a very slow, gradual recovery is safest is the only way in [
      <span class="unclear">this as</span>]
       in other
      matters, to 
      thoroughness &amp; a very speedy rally would be [
      <span class="unclear">specious,</span>]
       treacherous in the end,
      leading [
      <span class="unclear">you to
         do</span>]
       what you were not yet fit for. [
      <span class="unclear">I believe</span>]
       if I could only make you
      [
      <span class="unclear">conscious</span>]
      
      of the love, the enfolding love my [
      <span class="unclear">heart</span>]
       breathes out toward you, it
      [
      <span class="unclear">would</span>]
       do
      you physical good. Many–sided [
      <span class="unclear">love—</span>]
      Mothers love that cherishes,
      that delights so in personal service [
      <span class="unclear">that sees</span>]
       in sickness &amp; suffering
      such dear appeals to an answering limitless tenderness—wife's love— ah you draw that
      from me too, resistlessly—I have no choice—Comrades love, so happy in
      sharing all, pain, sorrow, toil, effort, enjoyments, thoughts, hopes, aims,
      struggles, disappointment, beliefs, aspirations. Childs love too that trusts
      utterly, confides unquestioningly.—Not more spontaneously &amp; wholly without
      effort or volition on my part, does the sunlight flow into my eyes when I open them
      in the morning 
      [
      <span class="unclear">than does the sense of
         your existence enter like bright light into my awaking soul. And then I
         send</span>]
       to you [
      <span class="unclear">thoughts—tender, caressing
         thoughts—that would fain nestle so close—ah, if you could feel them,
         take them in, let them lie in your breast, each morning.</span>]
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>[
      <span class="unclear">My children are all well,
         dear Friend. Herbert is going to spend
         his holidays with his brother in Wales—&amp; we shall all go to Colne as usual the end
         of this month &amp; remain there through</span>]
       August and September  so if you think of it,
      address any paper you may send [
      <span class="unclear">to</span>]
       Earls Colne, Halstead, because I should get it a day sooner. But
      it does not signify [
      <span class="unclear">if
         you forget &amp;</span>]
       send it here; it will be forwarded all right.
      Beatrice has
      just got [
      <span class="unclear">through one of
         the Govern. Exams, in elementary mathematics;</span>]
       and I hope Herby
      [
      <span class="unclear">has</span>]
       got
      into the Academy, [
      <span class="unclear">but do
         not know for certain yet. He works away zealously</span>]
       and with great
      [
      <span class="unclear">delight</span>]
       in
      his work. William 
      Rossetti and his wife
      [
      <span class="unclear">are coming to dine with
         us Wednesday—they look</span>]
       so well [
      <span class="unclear">and happy, it does one good to see them. The
         Conways are
         going to Ostend, I think, for their</span>]
       holiday, [
      <span class="unclear">&amp; when they</span>]
       come
      back [
      <span class="unclear">are</span>]
       going
      to move into a [
      <span class="unclear">larger
         house.</span>]
       I heard an American [
      <span class="unclear">lady,</span>]
       Miss Whitman, [
      <span class="unclear">sing at a concert the
          other day, who
         delighted me, fascinated me—I longed to kiss</span>]
      
       her after each song,
      though some of them were poor enough Verdi stuff—but she contrived to impart
      genuineness &amp; beauty to them. I hope you will hear her when she returns to
      [
      <span class="unclear">America, which will
         be soon, I believe.</span>]
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Good bye, dearest Friend—Beatrice Herby &amp; Grace join
      their love [
      <span class="unclear">with mine. I
         had the sweet little Bridal Poem all safe, &amp; by the bye I</span>]
      
      
      [
      <span class="unclear">liked</span>]
       that
      Springfield paper very much.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
