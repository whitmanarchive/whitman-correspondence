   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="nyp.00624_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Wm D O'Connor | 1015 O Street N W | Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Camden,
      N.J. | Jan 3(?) | 8 PM | 89; Washington, Rec'd | Feb 1 | 7 AM | 89 | 4.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6167">3. Whitman is referring to Gabriel
      Sarrazin's "Poetes modernes de l'Amerique, Walt Whitman," which appeared in <em>La Nouvelle Revue</em>, 52 (May 1, 1888), 164–184.
      Whitman had asked both William Sloane Kennedy and Richard Maurice Bucke to make
      an abstract in English of it (see Whitman's letter to Kennedy of , and to Bucke of ). Sarrazin's piece is reprinted in
      an English translation by Harrison S. Morris in <em>In Re</em>
      (1893, pp. 159–94). Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935) was a translator
      and poet from France, who commented positively not only on Whitman's work but
      also on Poe's. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 609.<a href="#r3">[back]
