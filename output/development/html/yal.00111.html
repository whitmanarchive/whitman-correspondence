      <br></br><br></br>J R Osgood &amp; 
      Co:
      <br></br>Dear Sirs
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of 13th 
      rec'd. About the plate my impression still is that in the hands of a good expert
      steel plate printer it will be found to be not only not worn, but just about as good
      as new. There have been less than 2000 impressions struck off from it altogether,
      &amp; it has been carefully preserved. However let us say $40 (instead of 50)
      as the price (with the books &amp; prints before specified).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My notion is against getting up any further portrait (this steel plate will have to
      <u>permanently</u> continue in all issues) for this issue, or
      at present<sup><a href="#yal.00111_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—let that be kept for something to give
      added zest to a future issue—perhaps a year or two from now. Besides we would
      have to hurry too much—for I think the book better be thrown on the market
      forthwith—all the favorable stars are apparently just now in
      conjunction—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The press-work (which I hope will be <u>very carefully
         done</u>, &amp; with good ink)—&amp; the binding, color, style, (strong,
      plain, 
      unexpensive, is my notion, nothing fancy) are now about to be prepared for
      immediately, &amp; the plate printing to be at once put in hand. The book will not
      make more than 390 pages (most likely 385 to 390.)—I am in favor of its being so
      trimmed &amp; bound that it will be as eligible as possible for the pocket, &amp; to
      be carried about—&amp; I am <u>not</u> in favor of wide
      margins.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have no objection for any specific time for the contract to continue if you wish.
      I
      think of calling Friday noon 16th at your place—
   </p>

   <p id="yal.00111_n1">2. The firm suggested on
       the inclusion of "another
      plate—a portrait of yourself as now." Why Whitman decided against using
      the Gutekunst portrait which he originally suggested in his letter to Osgood on
      , is not clear.<a href="#r2">[back]
