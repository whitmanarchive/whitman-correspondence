   <p>Your card of 22d<sup><a href="#loc.07313_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> came to hand yesterday evening and has
      made me feel very bad and I should feel still worse but for the interline "am
      certainly easier" which I earnestly hope may be still true. I shall look anxiously
      for further word of you. About the Photo'<sup><a href="#loc.07313_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> that you have
      for me—thanks in advance—there is a young man going from the Asylum to
      Phila' tomorrow—he will call to see Ed.<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r3">3</a></sup> and you and he
      will bring the photo' back safe (he is coming right back) if you will give it to
      him. His name is Dick Flynn he was here in '80 and
      recollects you well and wants to see you—he will tell you about the Asylum and
      all of us.<sup><a href="#loc.07315_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> We are well and all goes well with us here—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4319">3. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.07315_n4">4. Richard "Dick" Flynn was a longtime assistant to Bucke at the London asylum, 
      doing odd jobs. Whitman met Flynn and admired his gardening work when he visited Bucke
      in 1880; he mentions 
      Flynn in his , letter to Thomas Nicholson. Traubel also records that Whitman was anticipating a
      visit from Flynn in Camden 
      shortly before Bucke wrote this letter (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.142.html">Tuesday, August 27, 1889</a>). Flynn, while on a tour of the U.S., apparently 
      stopped by Whitman's Mickle Street home and carried a copy of the Gutekunst photograph
      of 1889 back to London with him. Whitman had worried that the photo would get 
      damaged in the mail. Whitman and Bucke both greatly admired this photographic portrait,
      which is available in <em>The Walt Whitman's Archive</em>'s Gallery of Images.<a href="#r4">[back]
