   <p>The white population predominates here enough to free us from the unpleasantness experienced

      too quiet and impartial to ever be a party man, thinks
      
      that in some of the cases A ought not to have the office—because B wants it, and B
      ought not to have it—because A wants it, and both ought not to have it—because neither
      is fit for it. This is a queer letter to come from a sober, studious thoughtful man—so
      careful in all business matters, but I have so written it, both for information and
      to <u>amuse</u> my friend Mr. Whitman who has done me the <u>greatest</u> <u>honor</u> of my life.

   <p>The book (of Burroughs') and the packet of letter, poem, and picture came, as the

      beyond the power of words of mine to express,
      
      I suspect the most notable point in Burroughs' book is page 42 middle and only [

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.
