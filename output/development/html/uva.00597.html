      <br></br><br></br>Dear Lou
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your card rec'd to day—Nothing particular or very new with me—Hot and
      oppressive here eight or nine days &amp; I have been under the weather probably from
      it as much as anything—Keep up ab't the same tho'—am taking a tonic dose
      (iron &amp; strychnia I fancy) prescribed by Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r1">1</a></sup> to stave
      off the terrible weakness &amp; faintness—&amp; it does so—but it costs
      as much as it comes too—So far I eat &amp; sleep pretty well, wh' of course is
      the greatest help—Got a card f'm Hannah,<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; have
      written to her this evn'g—I send my best love to Amy and Warren<sup><a href="#uva.00597_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I wish I had something to send them—They are
      getting printed in a little book the speeches<sup><a href="#loc.03027_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp;c at my birth-day dinner<sup><a href="#loc.03027_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; I
      will send you one when out—&amp; one to Emma<sup><a href="#prc.00049_n1" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      too—
   </p>
   
   <p>I havn't been out this is the fourth day in the wheel chair<sup><a href="#loc.03012_n1" id="r7">7</a></sup> but shall resume in a day
      or two—I am sitting here in the old den in Mickle st second story near sunset
      quite comfortable—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0285">2. Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908),
      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00597_n1">3. Amy and Warren Dowe were
      the children of Emma Dowe, Louisa Whitman's sister (see Whitman's letter of ).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03027_n3">4. The notes and addresses that
      were delivered at Whitman's seventieth birthday celebration on May 31, 1889 in
      Camden, were collected and edited by Horace Traubel. The volume was titled <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em>, and it included a
      photo of Sidney Morse's 1887 clay bust of Whitman as the frontispiece. The book
      was published in 1889 by Philadelphia publisher David McKay.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03027_n4">5. For Whitman's seventieth
      birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
      the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
      (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.30.html">Tuesday, May 7, 1889</a>. The day was celebrated with a testimonial
      dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
      addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
      arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00049_n1">6. Emma Dowe was Louisa
      (Mrs. George Washington) Whitman's sister. Her husband Francis E. Dowe operated
      dry goods stores in Norwich, Connecticut, from 1872 to 1918. A copy of the
      letter Whitman refers to was preserved by Mrs. Dowe's daughter Amy, who wrote "A
      Child's Memories of the Whitmans." This reminiscence, composed in the 1930s, has
      been published by Edwin Haviland Miller in "Amy H. Dowe and Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em>, 13 (September 1967),
      73–79.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03012_n1">7. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy of .<a href="#r7">[back]
