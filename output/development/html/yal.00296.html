   <p>I was really astonished to hear my quondam college mate—young Henry Norman<sup><a href="#n3171" id="r1">1</a></sup>—was the one who engineered the <u>Pall
         Mall Gazette</u> subscription. I always knew Norman had a soft spot 'way down
      deep in him somewhere. There was a race-antipathy between us, however. I <u>suspect</u> I was the one who first introduced you to him. For
      when we were in college together in Cambridge Mass. I was in the first flush of my
      enthusiasm for you; had just read you for the first time, &amp; after a while I came
      out &amp; made a solemn confession of faith before the whole Divinity
      School—Professors &amp; all— &amp; told them what I had found in you.
      They were a band of earnest liberal fellows (Norman &amp; I the best read of 'em)
      &amp; I saw that they did not laugh, &amp; that my solemnity impressed them. I
      suspect, my  dear
      friend, that you–being of English &amp; Dutch stock—do not find in you the
      race-antipathy that I—a French-Scotch-Irish-Englishman find in me.
   </p>
   
   <p>As to Norman—It is what we might expect to find one of 
      yr
      
       opposites seeking you for inspiration. He certainly <u>needs</u> you, if any man does—in the heart department he is quite
      stony—veilled by culture &amp; Unitarianism (or was 8 
      yrs 
      
       ago: I suspect he has <u>mellowed</u> since that) His
      father is a wealthy Unitarian manufacturer of Leicester County England. Norman is
      intellectually brilliant, &amp; no mistake. We have had some tiffs in the <u>Critic</u>. But I wish him well. His 
      pam. 
      
       on the Irish evictions won my sympathy, &amp; now what Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> tells me of this Pall Mall matter increases my esteem.
      We must een love
      him, Hal. I suppose.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had a <u>crazy</u>, <u>crazy</u> letter from
      poor Mid. Alabama fellow.<sup><a href="#n0914" id="r3">3</a></sup> He is in trouble of some sort. Sent me his name &amp; $5
      for the book. He is a very sore-headed crank still over his visit to you.

   <p>I have some score of names of subscribers sent to me. How many

   <p>Rhys continues his schemes on society's pocket-book, &amp; demoralizes my nerves
      frightfully when I see him, somehow. Charity, charity, man, I keep saying (&amp;
      think of my own grievous sins). I send you a <u>Transcript</u>
      marked, and also send you my love in unlimited quantities. Remember me cordially to

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3171">1. Sir Henry Norman (1858–1939)
      was an English liberal politician and on the editorial staff of the <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em>. In gathering funds to help Whitman,
      Norman was acting for the editor of the newspaper, William T. Stead
      (1849–1912); see <em>American Literature</em>, XXXIII
      (1961), 68–69, and the letter from Whitman to William T. Stead, . See also Whitman's letter to

   <p id="loc.03310_n1">2. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0914">3. John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.03316_n2">4. Frederick W. Wilson was a
      member of the Glasgow firm of Wilson &amp; McCormick that published the 1883
      British edition of <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em>.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n1049">5. James Matlock Scovel began to
      practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War he was in the New Jersey
      legislature, and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned actively for Horace
      Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S. Treasury during Chester
      Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home
      for Sunday breakfast, as he did on December 2 and 9, 1877 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a description of
      these breakfasts, see <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed.
      William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel,
