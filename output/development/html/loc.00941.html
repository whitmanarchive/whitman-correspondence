   </p>
   
   <p>Many thanks for your long good letter, which I am not going now to answer. I write
      at the request of Charlie Eldridge who said that he should be too busy to-day to do
      so, to tell you that he and Mrs. Cooper are to leave here either in the 8 A.M. or
      the 11 A.M. train on Monday next, for Philadelphia, and he is to remain at her house
      that night.<sup><a href="#loc.00941_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> They want you to leave New York so as to meet them, and stay at her house too. Her
      
      residence is No. 1429 Girard Avenue, between Broad &amp; 15th Streets.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mrs. Cooper has been coaxing, persuading, begging, entreating, commanding even William
      to go on with them too, but he says he
      <em>can't</em>
      , &amp; I know him well enough to know that she can't move him.<sup><a href="#loc.00941_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> She wants me to go on also, but I know that I shall not unless some strong pressure
      is brought to bear between now &amp; Monday, for I can see that William does not want
      to spare me.
   </p>
   
   <p>They fully count upon seeing you. Charlie will remain at Mrs. C's till Tuesdayevening. By the way—he got your letter, &amp; was delighted with it, he said it was worthy
      to be set in a gold frame &amp; to which Wm. &amp; I assented most heartily.
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Walt, we long for you, William sighs for you, &amp; I feel as if a large part of
      myself were out of the city,—I shall give you a good big kiss when you come, so depend
      upon it.
   </p>
   
   <p>My
      <em>love</em>
      to your good, noble mother, whom I shall some day know. Kiss her for me—&amp; tell her
      that I love her boy 
      Walt. I want to see those splendid children too. But I shall some day. Good bye.
   </p>
   
   <p>No more now, but if you are not back in a few days I will write you a good long letter,
      and answer yours fully.
   </p>
   
   <p>Oh! do you know that Mrs. Howells is in New York, has been there a week.<sup><a href="#loc.00941_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years, and he speaks often in his letters of their daughter Jean, by nickname
      "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break in late
      1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated black citizens,
      Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence between Whitman and
      Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For
      more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see also Dashae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

      D. Kummings, ed., (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00941_n1">1. In December 1862, on his
      way to visit his brother George at Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt Whitman
      stopped in Washington and encountered Charles W. Eldridge, who was now a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster. After he had seen for himself that George
      had not been severely wounded, he returned to Washington, which was to be his
      home until 1873. Eldridge obtained a desk for Whitman in the office of Major
      Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster. The identity of Mrs. Cooper is unclear. A
      Mrs. Cooper is mentioned in Whitman's notation on Ellen O'Connor's letter of
      , and on , O'Connor informed Whitman that
      Eldridge was going to stay at Mrs. Cooper's home in Philadelphia for several
      days. This is undoubtedly the Hattie B. Cooper (listed in the Directory as C. H.
      B. Cooper, "gentlewoman") who in an undated letter sent a "Christmas Greeting"
      to Whitman—"from one who has the <em>heart</em>—but
      not the <em>head</em>—of a poet, and consequently feels a
      sincere admiration and reverence for those Gifted Mortals, who possess both"
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). Fred Vaughan referred to who is likely a
      different Mrs. Cooper on ; the Mrs.
      Cooper of Vaughan's letters was the mother of his roommate Robert "Bob" Cooper
      after Vaughan left Whitman's Classon Avenue apartment.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00941_n2">2. For a time Whitman lived
      with William and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Eldridge and later Burroughs, were
      to be his close associates during the early Washington years. William O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an
      abolition novel published by Thayer and Eldridge in 1860. He had been an
      assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> before he
      went to Washington. O'Connor was an intelligent man who deserved something
      better than the various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his
      death. The humdrum of clerkship, however, was relieved by the presence of
      Whitman whom he was to love and venerate—and defend with a single-minded
      fanaticism and an outpouring of vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been
      equaled. He was the first, and in many ways the most important, of the adulators
      who divided people arbitrarily into two categories: those who were for and those
      who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised O'Connor in the preface to a
      posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born sample here in the 19th
      century of the flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood. Thrice
      blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York,
      D. Appleton, 1910] pp. 513).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00941_n3">3. She was the wife of
      Charles Joseph Howells. According to entries in New York Directories, he must
      have been versatile (and perhaps eccentric): in 1864–1865 he was an
      "inventor," in 1865–1866 an inspector in the Custom House, in
      1866–1867 simply an "inspector," and in 1867–1868 a seller of
      hairpins.<a href="#r3">[back]
