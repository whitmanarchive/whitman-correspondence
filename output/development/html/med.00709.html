   <p>I have had the book a couple of days and have looked
      through it, I believe it will do, and if it will the
      Editor will deserve more credit than the Author<sup><a href="#med.00709_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I
      am really surprised at the tact and judgement you have displayed in putting my rough
      M.S. into shape and I am more than satisfied with all you have done—I see now
      that you were right about the Latin motto<sup><a href="#med.00709_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> (as about
      every thing else)—it is <u>not</u> in line with the book
      and is better out of it. I should like to know who will be the English 
      Pubr
      
       and when the book will be published in England and when here? I suppose
      
      
      McKay will send me a statement (all in good time)
      showing my financial position as toward the vol.?
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all well here, the season is backward, the leaves not fully out yet; indeed
      the oaks and even some of the maples and elms have scarcely begun to come out
      yet—however the asylum grounds look lovely, we have had a great deal of rain
      and the grass and the young leaves are exquisitely fresh and green

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
