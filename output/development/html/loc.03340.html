      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Glad to have yours of Oct. 9<u>th</u>, with added note from
      Bucke.<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r1">1</a></sup><u>He</u>, I daresay, is not
      altogether wrong about my other self, who is possessed at times with the itch of
      Transcendentalism to a notable degree, + is always wishing to grasp the impossible.
      However the philosophy of <u>L. of G.</u> has well been wholly
      lost on him; + the late adventure of Wales has had richly human results in many
      ways. I believe I last
      wrote to you from Carmarthen, where I stayed with my dear grand-parents, making
      excursions far + wide,—to all the old castles + pleasant sea-slopes +
      hill-crests within reach. There one day, standing on Merlin's Hill, "Where once old
      Merlin stood And saw the silver Towy fill with flood!" + looking to the sea on one
      side, + to the 
      Llgw-y-fan
      
       region (where I stayed last year) on the other, a new sense of human
      destiny, + of the epic continuity from old Wales to new America in the history of
      races, came upon me. Which [
      <span class="unclear">Art?</span>]
       + Time may yet keep me to fully express. And many such stirring
      thoughts, (as I dropped with ready strides down those Welsh mountains at nightfall,
      or arm-in-arm with my grandfather listened to his stories of his youth,) used to
      come from time to time, quickening me out of the ruts of literary convention +
      routine.
   </p>
   
   <p>From Carmarthen, on to Swansea,—a seaport town! Here I stayed with a bright
      young fellow at his seaside cot at the Mumbles,—a picturesque village amid
      curious cliffs. Here too I lectured,—on Bohemian London, + went through a
      round of feastings + jollifications. (I am just posting an article or two on Swansea
      to a London paper, copy of which shall be sent you when the thing is in print).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>No doubt you have had some account of this delightful country place from me before.
      Here my Uncle Percival, who is a Naturalist + Poultry-fancier, among other things,
      has a house almost ideal in its way—the old-fashioned English way! I wish you
      could see it. The house stands amid great lawns + gardens on the slopes of the Vale
      of Avallon, with Glastonbury Tor in the distance rising up mysteriously, capped by
      a
      solitary old tower. I am just about to set off to climb it, and as I stand there
      shall remember to [
      <span class="unclear">wing?</span>]
       yet another shaft of imagination to you sitting solitary
      perchance in Mickle St.! With all desires, that you may have poet's thoughts still
      to drive off pain, + indeed everything that you yourself desire!—
   </p>

   <p>Shall be glad to have 'Birthday' book!—I shall probably be back in London
      in a fortnight time.—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
