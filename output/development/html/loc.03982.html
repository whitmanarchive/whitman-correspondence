   </p>
   
   
   <p>I dont know as I have any thing to say that will interest you,<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r1">1</a></sup> but I feal as if I would like to write something, and so I will begin by telling you about the
      fun I had last night, it was with a fellow that has been thinking for a long time
      he could throw me, so last night him and I came togeather for, the first; he said he could throw me and I said if he thought so he was welcome
      to try his hand, so we [
      <span class="unclear">bucked?</span>]
      
      
      
      
      in, he his first holt and mine second, his holt we puled around for a short time and then I let loose on him and down he went, then came my
      holt (he did not want me to [
      <span class="unclear">hav?</span>]
       it but I got him in to it) and I asked him if he was ready and he said he was so
      I stood him on his head, he got up and said he would go home, but he did not have
      much to say all the way home, I guess that I hurt his neck by the way he went, but
      he did not say anything. There is one more fellow who I want to take the
      
       
      conceat out of, and that is B.K. Sharp,<sup><a href="#loc.03982_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> he thinks he could do what he pleased with me but I want to show him he cannot do
      it. I was out Sunday night had a good time, went to church and then, come home. Cousin
      Lizzie was over to our house Sunday and went to Sunday school, then came home ate
      our suppers and then went out for a ride. I will be down to see you Saturday if nothing
      happens more than I know of now, will be down on the (5 ½) train, perhaps on the (2)
      I don't know yet for certain.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>The folks are all well, and my-self the same. I think of you where ever I have a moment
      to think, I don't get much time to think about anyone for when I am not thinking of
      my business I am thinking of what I am [
      <span class="unclear">shielding?</span>]
      , I want to try and make a man of my-self, and do what is right if I can do it. I
      havent seard from J I Allen yet. I will have to stop writing now for my sheat is giving out and I must [

       to work, 
      
      so good bye. [illegible] write and let me know how you are

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0590">1. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03982_n1">2. B.K. Sharp was Harry's
      employer, according to Edwin Haviland Miller (see "Introduction," <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1964], 3:6).<a href="#r2">[back]
