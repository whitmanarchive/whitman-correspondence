      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was very sorry not to have seen you yesterday before you left, because the enclosed
      answer came from Westerman, and I wanted to consult with you as to the steps to be
      taken. I think a package ought to be made up at once for  Ferdinand Freiligrath, and we can send it through Westerman, reimbursing him for any expense of
      transportation. I suppose it would be best to have it done by my agency, and I
      suggest that I write F. F. a letter, (to go with the package) explaining things
      generally, and making him as far as possible, master of the situation. What do you think? I am
      sorry I did not know you were going yesterday, because we could have arranged it all
      better than now.
   </p>
   
   <p>Preserve the enclosed. I think the sooner we do what is to be done (if anything)
      regarding F. F., the better.
   </p>
   
   <p>I write hurriedly, just on the edge of mail-time. No letters for
      
      you today at the Attorney General's. I hope you'll have a good time. Give my love
      to
      your mother. John came in yesterday and bid me tell you to come up to his house
      before you left. I did not then know you had gone. He will be disappointed.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Affectionately Yours,
      <br></br>W.D.O'Connor.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p><u>Kindest regards to Mrs Price</u>.
