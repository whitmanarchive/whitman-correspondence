      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How quickly the year comes round!—and I haven't sent a word to you I believe
      since last May. It is too bad. I got the newspaper however with account of your
      lecture—and I hear there is a poem of yours reprinted in the Review of Reviews
      which I haven't seen yet. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r1">1</a></sup> writes occasionally + gives me
      news of you.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>The two Ford sisters<sup><a href="#loc.01238_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and W<u>m</u>
      Thompson<sup><a href="#n4126" id="r3">3</a></sup> + R. D. Roberts<sup><a href="#tex.00449_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> +
      myself saw our usual little remembrances, dear Walt—enclosed first of exchange
      for $203.65 on the Tradesmens' National Bank, Phila—(£42)—with much
      love + good wishes to you, always the same. Roberts have lately married and sends
      "warmest + good wishes + greetings from us <u>both</u>". The
      eldest Miss Ford (Bessie) has been very ill for some months (internal complaint) but
      is getting better now—sits out under the trees. Isabella has written a little
      novel in Murray's Magazine wh. is quite a success. I am going over to see them in
      a
      few days.
   </p>
   
   <p>How do you manage, Walt, about getting out now? Do you get out much in your chair,
      or
      are you kept in a good deal. It does make such a difference if one can be out. Have
      you seen Havelock Ellis' new book on The New Spirit. There is a fine essay on W. W.
      and the book is intonating all this—but no doubt he has sent it you.
   </p>
   
   <p>We go on much the same here—the social question grows daily + seems likely to
      absorb all other interests. A new hope in the breasts of the millions of Europe's
      toiling masses—a new light in their eyes.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have taken up the <u>sandal</u> trade, and make quite elegant
      leather sandals at 10/6 a pair. Will you have a pair??
   </p>
   
   <p>Send us a line on
      receipt
      of this + believe us ever yr. loving friends
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01238_n2">2. Isabella Ford
      (1855–1924) was an English feminist, socialist, and writer. Elizabeth
      (Bessie) Ford was her sister. Both were introduced to Whitman's writings by
      Edward Carpenter and they quickly became admirers of the aged poet.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4126">3. William J. "Billy" Thompson
      (1848–1911), known as "The Duke of Gloucester" and "The Statesman," was a
      friend of Whitman's who operated a hotel, race track, and amusement park on the
      beach overlooking the Delaware River at Gloucester, New Jersey. His shad and
      champagne dinners for Whitman were something of a tradition. See William Sloane
      Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> (1896),
      15–16.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00449_n2">4. R. D. Roberts had a
      master's degree from Cambridge, and Charles R. Ashbee was a Cambridge
      undergraduate; see Carpenter's letter of .
      On May 10, 1883, Whitman sent three copies of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> and <em>Specimen Days</em> to William Thompson in
      Nottingham, England (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.). The Ford sisters had given Whitman £50 in 1885 (see the letter from
      Whitman to Carpenter of ). On this
      date Whitman noted receipt of $216.75 from Carpenter and $145.58 from Rossetti
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r4">[back]
