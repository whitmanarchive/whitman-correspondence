   </p>
   
   <p>Back here again last night—after a fine time of it at Mrs. Nordhoff's,<sup><a href="#n4141" id="r15">15</a></sup> where everyone was so kind &amp; the fun so continued all day long, that I did not find
      time to write you even a line.
   </p> 
   
   <p>There were some jolly young fellows there, &amp; some splendid girls, but among the last
      
      I think Alys Smith<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n1" id="r16">16</a></sup> may be said to have "taken the cake." Dressed as Portia, when a Shakespeare masquerade
      (in which everyone took some part from the plays) was being enacted, it would have
      delighted your eyes to see her dance,—"A wild Bacchante passionate of foot!"—The house
      itself stands on the Palisades of the Hudson, about 500 feet or so above 
      the river on a steep cliff, commanding a superb view right over to the sea &amp; far away
      up &amp; down the Hudson. The place [
      <span class="unclear">would?</span>]
       
      
      have thoroughly suited you for a camping spot.
   </p>
   
   <p>Passing through New York yesterday, in a bright, splendid sunlight, the rush of life
      in Broadway made me wish you could have been with me there.
   </p>            
   
   <p>After the stupid, half-&amp;-half pretence of Philadelphia, the reckless, go-ahead life
      in New York is very refreshing. Tell this not to the Philadelphians!
   </p>                
   
   <p>No letters arrived at Alpine Bergen for me,—so I suppose none have reached you! If
      there are any waiting now, will you mail them on here. I expect to go to Boston on
      Friday or Saturday—after which my address will be to the care of Kennedy at Belmont.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you are feeling well these bright days. I am trying to persuade myself that
      from this New Year forward everything is to be first-rate with me &amp; with all my friends—in
      the higher, eternal sense, if not always &amp; altogether in the other!

   </p>
   
   <p>A Happy New Year!</p>
   
   <p>I send you the article on Mrs Gilchrist's book from the <u>Nation</u>, for which I have never ceased hunting, and which I found where it
      had no business to be. You will observe that the holy Father sprinkles us with an
      aspergillus full of ice water. The cold impudence of that <u>Nation</u> surpasses.
   </p>
   
   <p>Sometime when you are sending you can return me the article for my collection.</p>
   
   
   <p>I have for some time wanted to write to you, but have been strangely ill, and only
      just able to walk through the office duties. I keep up my spirits as well as I can,
      but find it all pretty depressing.
   </p>
   
   <p>The article by the wretch named Willard<sup><a href="#loc.03323_n1" id="r18">18</a></sup> in the American
      Magazine filled me with indignation. What a beast a man must be who comes to you
      with a letter of introduction, and goes off to caricature and lampoon you in a
      magazine!
   </p>  
   
   <p>I hope you have read "King Solomon's Mines."<sup><a href="#loc.03323_n3" id="r19">19</a></sup> It is
      immense. I have read it forty times, I do believe. The battle chapters let one into
      the spirit of Homer as the translations cannot do.  I wish somebody would rightly
      review it for the benefit of the Boston school.
   </p>
   
   <p>I see the little pieces you send forth. "Yonnondio" is beautiful.<sup><a href="#loc.03323_n2" id="r20">20</a></sup> The Boston <u>Advertiser</u>, which
      also has for you an aspergil of ice-water, copied it, which is an act of
      tribute.—I think your term, "Shakespeare-Bacon,"<sup><a href="#loc.03323_n4" id="r21">21</a></sup>
      will stick to Verulam.<sup><a href="#loc.03323_n5" id="r22">22</a></sup> Donnelly<sup><a href="#n4108" id="r23">23</a></sup> is,
      I guess, in England, getting out his English edition. I have not heard from him
      since October, and await his movements on tiptoe.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you are keeping reasonably well. Au revoir.</p>

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="n3039">2. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,

   <p id="n0590">7. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      British edition of <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em>.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07694_n1">9. More than a year later, in
      his letter to Whitman of , Kennedy
      wrote that Wilson would publish his book on Whitman only if Kennedy paid the
      costs of production.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07694_n2">10. Kennedy's manuscript
      eventually became two books, <em>Reminiscences of Walt
         Whitman</em> (1896) and <em>The Fight of a Book for the
         World</em> (1926). Alexander Gardner (1821–1882) of Paisley, Scotland,
      a publisher who reissued a number of books by and about Whitman, ultimately
      published <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> in 1896 after a
      long and contentious battle with Kennedy over editing the book.<a href="#r10">[back]

      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      bookbinder David Gordon, and Ernest Rhys—one of Whitman's major promoters
      in England—worked with the firm. Rhys included a volume of Whitman's poems
      in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's prose in the Camelot
      series for Walter Scott publishers. Walter Scott also published Whitman's 1886

   <p id="loc.03323_n1">18.  O'Connor is likely
      referring to Cyrus Field Willard (1858–1942), an American journalist,
      political activist, and theosophist. In the December 1887 edition of <em>The American Magazine</em>, Willard dramatizes an interview he
      conducted with Whitman. Willard's depiction of Whitman is as a venerated but
      paralyzed man, whose speech is overwrought with contractions and elided
      syllables. Willard ends by appropriating Whitman's free verse and form in an
      improvised, perhaps satirical, poem entitled "America's Greeting to Walt." For
      the published interview, see Cyrus Williard, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00545.html">A Chat With The Good Gray Poet</a>."<a href="#r18">[back]
