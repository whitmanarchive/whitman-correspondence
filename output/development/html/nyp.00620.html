      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>Again a few lines to you. The past summer &amp; fall have laid me up again, &amp; I
      am now entering the sixth month of confinement in my big chair &amp; sick
      room—commenced early in June—abt the sixth <em>whack</em>
      (as I call it) from my old obstinate war-paralysis—from the overstrain'd work
      &amp; excitement of Secession years, 1863, 4 &amp; 5. I am now staving it off and
      on, but it is a serious siege &amp; I do not really look for it being raised
      anything like really—I am in good spirits &amp; comfortable enough. Mr.
      Fry<sup><a href="#nyp.00620_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> (of England bro't a note from you) call'd upon
      me yesterday—and I sent you by him my new little book <em>November Boughs</em><sup><a href="#n3999" id="r2">2</a></sup> (but it will be a week before he
      sails home). I have also a big 900 page Vol. nearly ready, combining all my
      writings, last revisions,<sup><a href="#n6157" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp;c.—I will send you a copy—Do you see
      anything of Rolleston?<sup><a href="#n1027" id="r4">4</a></sup> If so I send him my affectionate
      remembrances—I am sitting by my oak-wood fire writing this (cold but sunny
      weather here)—Spend most of my time alone—a few visitors—get along
      better than you might suppose. Love &amp; thanks to you, my friend, &amp; best best
      regards to my Irish friends all.

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00620_n1">1. With a letter of
      introduction dated  from Edward
      Dowden (see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.21.html"> Wednesday, November 12, 1888</a>), Lewis Fry (1823–1921), a
      Liberal and Unionist Member of Parliament from Bristol, England, called on
      Whitman on November 20. Whitman was much impressed with this "good Liberal" (see
      Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.20.html"> Tuesday, November 20, 1888</a>). Dowden acknowledged receipt of <em>November Boughs</em> (1888) on .<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n3999">2. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus

   <p id="n1027">4. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
