      Mr. Walt Whitman
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I own the stereotype plates of the work, "Leaves of Grass" by Walt Whitman with portrait
      of the author, and also the right to publish, which I bought of the assignees of Thayer
      and Eldridge,<sup><a href="#loc.00568_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; in which I am protected by the
      assignees, the master in Chancery, and by the laws of the Country, if I understand
      them.
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall unqualifiedly protest against the printing or publication of any work, bearing
      the title or containing in any way the same matter as the "Leaves of Grass." The plates
      and engraving are in the
      market at a nominal price, tho' I intend to republish if they are not soon disposed
      of.
      Also the stereotype plates of the pamphlets notices which we should be pleased to
      sell
      with the plates.
   </p>
   
   <p>We have a very few of the "Imprints" which we wish to keep, in case we publish and
      need
      them.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Horace Wentworth was Thayer and Eldridge's former
      boss who later acted as the firm's creditor. Wentworth received the plates of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> as compensation for his financial
      loss when Thayer and Eldridge went bankrupt in 1861. W.W. Thayer informed
      Whitman of this change in ownership on . For Wentworth's offer to sell the plates of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and <em>Leaves of Grass Imprints</em> to
      Whitman, see his  letter.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00568_n3">1. Thayer and Eldridge was a
      Boston publishing firm responsible for the third edition of Walt Whitman's <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde [1829–1896] and Charles W. Eldridge

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00877_n1">2. On , Thayer &amp; Eldridge informed Whitman that the
      plates of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> were now in the possession of
      Horace Wentworth, a Boston publisher, whom Thayer characterized as "My bitter
      and relentless enemy" and "an illiterate man."<a href="#r2">[back]
