   </p>
   
   
   <p>I still keep pretty well, &amp; am again down here at the farm in the country, for a couple
      of weeks, &amp; to stay over 4th of July. Nothing particularly new in my affairs. As I
      write this (Monday 10 a m) it is a beautiful bright breezy forenoon—&amp; I am going now
      down to the creek &amp; spring to take a bath—it is about 90 rods distant, &amp; I walk there
      &amp; back—Love, love, love,
   </p>

   <p>I still make my headquarters in Camden—</p>
