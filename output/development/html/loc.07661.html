      from the Phila. man of the N. Y. Herald<sup><a href="#loc.07661_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> who asks something of Elias Hicks<sup><a href="#n0301" id="r3">3</a></sup> (&amp; the
      Nov: B<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r4">4</a></sup>)—for the paper—wh' I promise to give—will send to-morrow. Your letters
      come &amp; are welcomed. No news yet of Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r5">5</a></sup> but I expect him any moment—I
      have somewhere a printed slip of "Old Age's Lambent Peaks"<sup><a href="#loc.07660_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; will yet send it—but I
      cannot lay my hand on it this moment—a cloudy rather pleasant day, almost
      cool—quiet—I reiterate the offer of my mare &amp; phaeton<sup><a href="#loc.07661_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup>—

      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0301">3. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker from Long
      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his
