      <br></br><br></br>My dear Friend and Guide.       
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>The book and photographs (for Ruskin)<sup><a href="#n3013" id="r2">2</a></sup> have arrived safely, and as soon as I hear from Ruskin of their receival by him I
      will let you know. At present he is away from home, and I have written to him to ask
      where he will have them addressed to.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When I sent him the 'extracts', I did not imagine it possible that he had never <u>heard</u> of you, and even <u>now</u> I feel sure he must have heard of you, but have taken little notice of the hearing,
      as so much that he hears is so
      
      
      unworthy of rememrance. But when he <u>read</u> the extracts, he seemed to be astonished, for I have never before heard of him using
      such a term as 'glorious' respecting any writings.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A little over a year ago, he had a brain fever, and I think that has caused him to
      forget many things he previously remembered. But if he had <u>read</u> your writings, I feel sure he would not have forgotten you altogether.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Ruskin is a great, good man. He is not only a beautiful writer, but a beautiful worker,
      and he
      
      
      will always <u>do</u> what he thinks he should do, even at the hazard of 'death' or disrepute. But I will
      write more of him in another letter.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>What I have in me to say to you on my own account cannot be uttered in any words.
      Through poverty and calumny you have been a constant encourager and faithful and beloved
      supporter. You have indeed led me into strifes but you have rendered infinite help,
      and, though I may have 'grinned,' I have steadfastly borne the temporary pain and
      
      
      have continued faithful.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You translated hitherto hidden languages for me; you opened my eyes, which had before
      been only partly open. You set me to work.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The Companions were hard to find, in the body, but until they appeared I had consolatation with the old companions and those yet to come—for I am a dreamer also.</p> 
   
   
   <p>Now I have found a few companions—all 'poor'—but your faithful lovers. Of these I
      hope to write to you in a future letter.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It would be for me the greatest pleasure to be</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3005">1. William Harrison Riley
      (1835–1907) was a British socialist who addressed Whitman as "My dear
      Friend and Master" in a letter on . Twelve
      years earlier he had found a copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> "and
      saw a Revelation.... In all my troubles and successes I have been strengthened
      by your divine teachings" (<em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin
      Haviland Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1964], 3:148 n17).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3013">2. John Ruskin (1819–1900) was
      one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
      via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
      of ). Ruskin, according to Whitman,
      expressed "<em>worry</em> [...] that [<em>Leaves</em> is] <em>too personal</em>, too emotional,
      launched from the fires of [...] spinal passions, joys, yearnings" (see the
      letter from Whitman to William O'Connor of ). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my
      Ruskin with some qualifications." Still, Ruskin "is not to be made little of: is
      of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.4.html">Thursday, January 24, 1889</a>).<a href="#r2">[back]
