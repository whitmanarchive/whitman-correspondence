   <p>Yours of 27<u>th</u> to hand this morning by mornings mail.<sup><a href="#syr.00047_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> So it took from 8 P.M. 27<u>th</u> to
      10 A.M. 30<u>th</u> (2 days &amp; 14 hours) to travel from
      Phil<u>a</u> to the asylum, much to long—the
      postal service is not at all what it should be on this continent—not half what
      it is in England [/] (I do not know how it is on the Continent of Europe). [—]
      Yours of 28<sup><a href="#syr.00047_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> also to hand by this afternoon mail (it
      seems to have done better, I judge it made the trip in just about two
      days—letters never come in less time than that—they ought to come in a
      little over a day. I have seen nothing about Tennyson's<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      illness, too bad such men must grow old and die—he is a grad fellow, ought to
      be immortal (will be, I hope). I get the O'C. cards and glad to get them. O'C.<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r5">5</a></sup> seems rallying finely again and if the fits would only keep off
      he might have a long pretty good spell—but I fear much they will not keep off
      for long—seems as if they had come to stay. Am greatly pleased to see that you
      are going in strong on the massage. [/] I hope for the best results from it. I send
      you my list of misprints—guess you have them all already—have found no
      new ones lately—not looking for any—no time. The "Saturday" came from
      O'C. yesterday, read it and was much amused.<sup><a href="#syr.00047_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> These
      polished [mutilation] litterateurs are as blind (half of them) as if they had been
      born without eyes. Then when others see something they cry out "nonsense, you only
      think you see something [/] it is all a delusion there is nothing at all there to
      see!" I have written to M<u>c</u>K.<sup><a href="#n4983" id="r7">7</a></sup> as
      follows: "Please let Mr W. have any copies he wants of my W. W. in sheet or
      otherwise free of copy right"

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
