      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I am <u>so</u> sorry to hear of your illness! And very sorry to
      hear the book has not reached you. I have now told my publisher to send another copy
      to your correct address.<sup><a href="#loc.02908_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
      I shall be glad to hear you are not
      dissatisfied with the essay on yourself. I formerly sent you some of my poetry, but
      it was early work. I hope I have been getting on since, &amp; have now got a
      place  perhaps as
      permanent as this sort of thing can be!—among our poets—though I am not
      <u>popular</u> here, or in America. I could wish to be more
      known in America.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad that <u>you</u> are <u>at last</u> taking your rightful place
      among the best.
   </p>
   
   <p> My debt to you is great.  Would that I could express it in person! I have often said the
      chief (if not the only) reason why I want to go to America is to see Niagara, the
      Yosemite, &amp; Walt Whitman! 
   </p>
   
   <p> You <u>did</u> send me your works, &amp; I value the present not
      a little. But I was sorry to see Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r3">3</a></sup> did not mention me
      among your early admirers, for I published in "Dark Blue" (an essay you &amp; Mr
      Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r4">4</a></sup> liked) long ago (this one is an <u>enlarged</u>
      republication of that).

   <p> I venture to send a photo of myself in return for some you sent me of yourself
      formerly.

   <p>I'll send a copy too of my last book, "Songs of

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Roden Noel (1834–1894) was an
      English poet, critic, and admirer of Whitman. Noel's "A Study of Walt Whitman:
      The Poet of Modern Democracy" (<em>Dark Blue</em> 2 [October
      1871], 241–253), spoke glowingly of the poet, describing him as "tall,
      colossal, luxuriant, unpruned, like some giant tree in a primeval forest. . . .
      He springs out of that vast American continent full-charged with all that is
      special and national in it" (242).

   <p id="loc.02908_n1">2. Noel had informed Whitman on
       that he had his publishers send
      Whitman "a vol. of [his] essays on Poetry and Poets." The poet replied on , stating he did not receive the book
      and describing himself as "well cared for, but paralyzed in body, &amp; quite
      unable to walk around." After Noel had re-sent his book, Whitman acknowledged
      its receipt on .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">4. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
