   <p>Am sitting here by the window in the little front room down stairs, well wrapt
      up—for though bright &amp; sunny it is a cold freezing day—have had my
      dinner (of rare stewed oysters, some toasted graham bread &amp; a cup of
      tea—relished all)—am about as usual—ups &amp; downs—had
      rather a bad day yesterday—lay on the lounge most of the day—now
      better—the worst is my enforced house-imprisonment, sometimes two weeks at a
      time—Spirits &amp; heart though mainly gay, which is the best half of the
      battle<sup><a href="#med.00754_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Love &amp; comfort to you, my
      friends—your wives &amp; all—Write often as you can—(monotony is
      now the word of my life)—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Kennedy, Burroughs, and Bucke were
      three of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Kennedy (1850–1929) first
      met Whitman while on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> in 1880, and would go on to write a book-length study of the
      poet. Burroughs (1837–1921), a naturalist, met Whitman in Washington, D.C.
      in 1864 and became one of Whitman's most frequent correspondents. He would also
      go on to write several studies of Whitman. Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian
      physician, was Whitman's first biographer, and would later become one of his
      medical advisors and literary executors.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00754_n1">1. The entry in Whitman's
      Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) on this date describes
      his emotional and physical state with a candor he rarely permitted himself in
      his letters: "Am I not having a 'happy hour,' or as near an approximation to it
      (the <em>suspicion</em> of it)—as is allowed? . . . (Is it
      not largely a really good condition of the stomach, liver &amp; excretory
      apparatus?)—I was quite ill all yesterday—(how quickly the
      thermometer slides up and down!)." <a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00754_n2">2. According to the auction
      record this letter was written on the verso of one from Charles W. Eldridge to
      Walt Whitman, undoubtedly the one of 
      partially printed by Clara Barrus in <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> (1931), 262–263. The postscript is
      recorded only in the catalogue of the Anderson Gallery, November 25,
      1927.<a href="#r2">[back]
