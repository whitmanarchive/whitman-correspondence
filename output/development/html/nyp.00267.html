      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I find my mother in excellent spirits &amp; fair health &amp; strength, considering her age,
      doing her own housework as usual. We have talked much about you &amp; Nelly. I am not
      at all satisfied with the quarters we occupy, &amp; shall make, probably in conjunction
      with George, some arrangements to have a house, or home for her &amp; the youngest brother,
      before I leave.<sup><a href="#nyp.00267_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> George is very well, lives home mainly, &amp; looks &amp; feels as hearty as can be—which
      is a pleasant surprise to me. I called at the <em>Galaxy</em> office yesterday, but found the Churches out of town—shall call again to-morrow or
      Tuesday.<sup><a href="#nyp.00267_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I saw Henry Clapp<sup><a href="#nyp.00267_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>—chatted pleasantly an hour with him at Pfaff's<sup><a href="#nyp.00267_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> 
      over some lager—he was very cordial &amp; communicative—I saw George Clapp<sup><a href="#nyp.00267_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup>—he is the same good creature, apparently not shined upon by fortune's bright sun,
      any more than formerly. H. C. spoke of the remnants of the old Bohemian crowd—expressed
      contempt for William Winter<sup><a href="#nyp.00267_n8" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      —called him Turvey-drop, &amp;c.—Stoddard, Steadman, Aldrich, Howells, Garrison,<sup><a href="#nyp.00267_n9" id="r8">8</a></sup> 
      &amp;c. were mentioned—there appears to be nothing new to tell about them. Garrison is
      the man of all work on the <em>Nation</em>. Stoddard still has his place in the Custom House. Ada Clare<sup><a href="#nyp.00267_n10" id="r9">9</a></sup> 
      is an actress—has lately been playing at Memphis, Tenn—is now about playing at Albany—Clapp
      remains as clerk in the City Hall—Spoke of your pamphlet—says he considers it absolutely
      one of the most vital productions in Literature. He read it through several times.
      It seems to have had lasting effect upon him both intellectually &amp; emotionally. Says
      there is nothing of its special character, ever produced, that is, upon the whole,
      equal to it. It is peerless. Clapp speaks in a tone of seriousness &amp; deference I never
      heard him use toward any other work or person<sup><a href="#nyp.00267_n11" id="r10">10</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have seen Haggerty<sup><a href="#nyp.00267_n12" id="r11">11</a></sup>—Just at dusk I was up Broadway, waiting for a Fulton ferry stage, when he came down
      upon me with genuine Irish warmth &amp; volubility—I was glad to see him, &amp; we had a talk
      of some fifteen minutes there on the street—He too spoke of the pamphlet—he said when
      he first heard of it he went down to Huntington's<sup><a href="#nyp.00267_n13" id="r12">12</a></sup> &amp; bought a copy, took it home, &amp; sat down &amp; read it to his wife—when through he read
      it a second time—&amp; then still a third time. He says he now regularly keeps the pamphlet
      within reach, &amp; whenever he feels the want of something to rouse him up, &amp; put his
      mental energies on the alert, he resorts to it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have seen Mrs. Price—she asked particularly about you—Mrs. Rhinds is unwell, &amp; has
      been taken home by her sister, to recuperate—John's book<sup><a href="#nyp.00267_n14" id="r13">13</a></sup> has been largely read—at least by those interested in L. of G. and its virtuous &amp;
      accomplished author—&amp; has had deepest appreciation &amp; acceptance in good quarters.
      Show John this letter—I send him my love—William, I have not yet rec'd any letters—when
      any come, send them to me 1194 Atlantic st. opposite Hamilton st. My sister Mat &amp;
      her children are here. Farewell.

      bears the address, "William D. O'Connor, | Light House Board, | Treasury

   <p id="nyp.00267_n3">2. Though none of Walt
      Whitman's letters to the family is extant between the periods of his two visits
      to Brooklyn in 1867, it is possible to reconstruct the activities of the family
      from correspondence addressed to him. Jeff was in St. Louis, and Martha and her
      children boarded with friends in Towanda, Pennsylvania, until they returned to
      Brooklyn, about the time Whitman was writing. George, not completely recovered
      from his illness, was working and living with his mother. The family was
      considering, as Whitman noted, building a home. Charles Heyde, in , complained vituperatively of Hannah's
      vulgarity and meanness, and described an encounter with her which he came out of
      with "the back of my right hand so badly lacerated by her nails that I am 
      compelld
      
       to bandage it." Ed, at least, caused no one any trouble. (Jesse had
      been confined to an asylum in December of 1864.)<a href="#r2">[back]

      William Conant Church (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a
      correspondent for several New York newspapers until he founded the <em>Army and Navy Journal</em> in 1863. With his brother
      Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906), he established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. Financial control of the <em>Galaxy</em> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it was absorbed
      by the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1878. William published a
      biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and Francis
      wrote for the New York <em>Sun</em> the unsigned piece "Yes,
      Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." See Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the
      <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23
      (1951–1952), 332–350; Donald N. Bigelow, <em>William Conant Church &amp;</em> "The Army and Navy Journal" (New York:
      Columbia University Press, 1952); J. R. Pearson, Jr., "Story of a Magazine:
      New York's <em>Galaxy</em>, 1866–1878," <em>Bulletin of the New York Public Library</em>, 61 (1957),
      217–237, 281–302.<br><br>
      Walt Whitman wrote positively of his meeting with Francis P. Church in his
       letter to William D.
      O'Connor.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00267_n5">4. 
      Henry Clapp (1814–1875) was one of Walt Whitman's intimates from the
      Pfaffian days. Restless and adventurous, Clapp roamed to Paris, returned in
      the 1840s to Lynn, Massachusetts, to edit the <em>Essex County
         Washington</em> (later <em>The Pioneer</em>), and
      eventually went to New York, where he became "king of the Bohemians." As
      editor of the short-lived <em>Saturday Press</em>
      (1858–1860; 1865–1866), he printed  ("Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking"),
      and, in 1860, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1860/anc.00035.html">praised <em>Leaves of Grass</em></a> when others
      condemned it; see Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary
         Singer</em> (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1955), 242–244,
      260–261. "Henry Clapp," Walt Whitman said to Horace Traubel, "stepped
      out from the crowd of hooters—was my friend: a much needed ally at
      that time (having a paper of his own) when almost the whole press of America
      when it mentioned me at all treated me with derision or worse. If you ever
      write anything about me in which it may be properly alluded to I hope you
      will say good things about Henry Clapp" (Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.63.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996], 1:236).
      In his reply to Walt Whitman on ,
      O'Connor was amused that Clapp was "becoming a respectable citizen. When
      once a man enters upon the downward path, &amp;c.…one can see as the
      guilty result of Bohemianism, a place in the Common Council or Board of
      Aldermen!"<br><br>
      See also Clapp's  and  letters to Whitman. Clapp is
      referred to in Whitman's 
      letter to William D. O'Connor and in his  letter to John Burroughs. See William Winter's
      sympathetic account of Clapp in <em>Old Friends, Being
         Literary Recollections of Other Days</em> (New York: Moffat, Yard and
      Company, 1909), 57–63. <a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00267_n6">5. According to Thomas
      Donaldson, <em>Walt Whitman the Man</em> (New York: Francis P.
      Harper, 1896), 206, Whitman said that he had not visited Pfaff's between 1865
      and 1881. For Whitman's account of a supper at Pfaff's, see his  letter to Hugo Fritsch.<a href="#r5">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00267_n8">7. William Winter
      (1836–1917) was a "sub-editor" of the <em>Saturday
         Press</em> and drama critic of the New York <em>Tribune</em>
      from 1865 to 1909. He was one of the "vilifiers" of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>, and was the butt of Whitman's idolators. Whitman himself termed
      Winter "a dried-up cadaverous schoolmaster" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1996], <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">2:93</a>), "miserable cuss" (<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.26.html">1:61</a>), and "an arrant damned fool" (<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.61.html">3:431</a>). In 1888 Winter voiced his hostility to Whitman before an
      English audience; see William Sloane Kennedy, <em>The Fight of a
         Book for the World</em> (West Yarmouth, Massachusetts, 1926), 81–82.
      In <em>Old Friends, Being Literary Recollections of Other
         Days</em>, Winter depicted the Pfaffians unsympathetically.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00267_n9">8. These men were Whitman's
      companions during the Pfaff's days, most of whom, like Clapp himself and Winter,
      had moved from bohemianism to respectability; they had entered upon O'Connor's
      "downward path." Richard Henry Stoddard (1825–1903) was appointed custom
      inspector in New York through the influence of Nathaniel Hawthorne. From 1860 to
      1870, he was a literary reviewer for the New York <em>World</em>.
      A poet as well as an anthologist, he was often characterized as the "Nestor of
      American literature" (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>).
      He referred briefly to Walt Whitman in <em>Recollections Personal
         and Literary</em> (New York: A. S. Barnes &amp; Co., 1903), 266. For Edmund
      Clarence Stedman (1833–1908), one of the few Pfaffians with whom Walt
      Whitman remained friendly throughout his life, see Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman. Thomas Bailey Aldrich (1836–1907) was associated with Clapp's <em>Saturday Press</em> during its first phase; see Ferris
      Greenslet, the <em>Life of Thomas Bailey Aldrich</em> (Boston:
      Houghton Mifflin, Co., 1908), 37–49. In 1865 Aldrich left New York and
      returned to Boston—to gentility and Longfellow. He was editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> from 1881 to 1890. For Aldrich's opinion
      of Whitman's poetry, see Greenslet, 138–139. William Dean Howells
      (1837–1920), the novelist, described his first meeting with Walt Whitman
      at Pfaff's in <em>Literary Friends and Acquaintances</em> (New
      York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1900), 73–76. Wendall Phillips Garrison
      (1840–1907), son of the celebrated abolitionist, was literary editor of
      the <em>Nation</em>.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00267_n10">9. Ada Clare, the stage and
      pen name of Jane McElheney (or McElhinney) (1836–1874), made her stage
      debut on August 15, 1855, at Wallack's Theatre in New York; see George Clinton
      Densmore Odell, <em>Annals of the New York Stage</em> (New York:
      Columbia University Press, 1927–1949), 6:365. She was an intimate of the
      bohemians who gathered at Pfaff's and wrote for the New York <em>Leader</em>. In his  letter to
      Walt Whitman, William W. Thayer wrote: "How's Bohemia and its Queen the charming
      Ada? She talks with us every week in the Leader in articles that 
      wify
      
       and I <em>love</em> to read." Her autobiographical
      novel, <em>Only a Woman's Heart</em> (1866), relates the
      sufferings of a woman in love with a young actor who becomes famous in the role
      of Romeo. Except for the contrived romantic conclusion and some melodramatic
      plotting, the book is an interesting, and occasionally penetrating, study of an
      Ophelia-like woman (Ada herself). She returned to the stage in 1867–1868.
      See Charles Warren Stoddard, "Ada Clare, Queen of Bohemia," <em>National Magazine</em>, 22 (1905), 637–645; Albert Parry, <em>Garrets and Pretenders: A History of Bohemianism in
         America</em> (New York: Covici-Friede, 1933), 14–37; Thomas Donaldson,
      <em>Walt Whitman the Man</em> (1896), 208; Emory Holloway, <em>Whitman—An Interpretation in Narrative</em> (New York:
      Alfred A. Knopf, 1926); Ralph Adimari and Emory Holloway, ed., <em>New York Dissected</em> (New York: Rufus Rockwell Wilson, 1936),

         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00267_n11">10. When O'Connor had
      belatedly sent Clapp a copy of his pamphlet, he had written defensively: "You
      <em>don't</em> believe in heroes, and I <em>do</em>! So I know beforehand that my pamphlet comes to you at a
      disadvantage" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r10">[back]

      <em>The Good Gray Poet</em> was published by Bunce and Henry E.
      Huntington Library, 459 Broome Street, New York. The correspondence between the
      publishers and O'Connor is in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00267_n14">13. Burroughs' <em>Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</em> was printed in
      Washington at the author's expense and was published in New York by the American
      News Company; see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931), <em>The Life and Letters of John Burroughs</em> (Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin Co., 1925), 1:116. See also Whitman's  letter to William D. O'Connor. Burroughs' book was composed with
      some assistance from O'Connor and Walt Whitman; see Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> (New York: Macmillan Co., 1955), 383,
      and Frederick P. Hier, Jr., "The End of a Literary Mystery," <em>American Mercury</em>, 1 (1924), 471–478. Interestingly, Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman wrote to her son on :
      "you know i like . . . the good gray poet better than i
