   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00666_n1">1. This letter is addressed: Wm
      D O'Connor | 1015 O Street N W | Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Camden (?)

   <p id="n4137">2. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

   <p id="nyp.00666_n2">3. Ellen O'Connor's note on
       was encouraging: "Wm. has had

   <p id="n4983">4. David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="med.00869_n3">5. Whitman had a limited pocket-book edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      printed in honor of his 70th birthday, on May 31, 1889, through special
      arrangement with Frederick Oldach. Only 300 copies were printed, and Whitman
      signed the title page of each one. The volume also included the annex <em>Sands at Seventy</em> and his essay <em>A
         Backward Glance O'er Traveled Roads</em>. See Whitman's , letter to Oldach. For more
