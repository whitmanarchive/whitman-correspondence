   <p>Well here I am, feeling fairly, commencing my 71st year. The dinner last evening came
      off &amp; went off, all right, &amp; was a great success<sup><a href="#loc.03027_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup>—they say they had a mighty good
      <u>dinner</u> (nothing to drink but Appollinaris water)—I was not at the eating part, but
      went an hour later—Ed<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r3">3</a></sup> wheel'd me in the chair<sup><a href="#loc.03012_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup>, &amp; two policemen &amp; two other good
      fellows just carried me from the sidewalk, chair &amp; all as I sat, up the stairs &amp;
      turning (which were fortunately wide &amp; easy) to the big banquet hall &amp; big crowd,
      where I was roll'd to my seat, &amp; after being rec'd with tremendous cheering they
      bro't me a bottle of first rate champagne &amp; a big glass with ice, (Tom Harned<sup><a href="#n4146" id="r5">5</a></sup> sent
      to his house for the wine)—The whole thing was tip top &amp; luckily I felt better &amp;
      more something like myself, and nearer chipper, than for a year—I made a short
      talk, wh' you will see in the paper I enclose<sup><a href="#loc.07667_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup>—also Herbert's<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r7">7</a></sup> speech—It was
      largely a home &amp; neighbors' affair (wh' I liked) although there were (&amp; speeches
      from) outsiders—The compliments &amp; eulogies to me were <u>excessive</u> &amp; without
      break<sup><a href="#loc.03027_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup>—But I fill'd my ice-glass with the good wine, &amp; pick'd out two fragrant roses
      f'm a big basket near me, &amp; kept cool &amp; jolly &amp; enjoy'd all—<sup><a href="#loc.07667_n3" id="r9">9</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I suppose you have the pocket-book copy L of G<sup><a href="#med.00869_n3" id="r10">10</a></sup> wh' I mailed yesterday—have just sold
      one &amp; got the 5 for it—Hamlin Garland<sup><a href="#loc.02128_n1" id="r11">11</a></sup> has been to see me to-day—also Tom

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07667_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr R M Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden,
      N.J. | Jun 1 | 8 PM | 89; London | AM | JU 4 | 89 | Canada.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.03027_n4">2. For Whitman's seventieth
      birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
      the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
      (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.30.html">Tuesday, May 7, 1889</a>. The day was celebrated with a testimonial
      dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
      addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
      arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">3. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03012_n1">4. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy of .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4146">5. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel (1856–1914), was
      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.07667_n2">6. Probably the Philadelphia
      <em>Press</em> of June 1, which reported the celebration at
      length and quoted Whitman and Herbert Gilchrist directly.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n0262">7. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <p id="loc.03027_n3">8. The notes and addresses that
      were delivered at Whitman's seventieth birthday celebration on May 31, 1889 in
      Camden, were collected and edited by Horace Traubel. The volume was titled <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em>, and it included a
      photo of Sidney Morse's 1887 clay bust of Whitman as the frontispiece. The book
      was published in 1889 by Philadelphia publisher David McKay.<a href="#r8">[back]

      Bucke. See also Whitman's , letter to
      Horace Traubel, regarding the published volume of birthday speeches <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David

      printed in honor of his 70th birthday, on May 31, 1889, through special
      arrangement with Frederick Oldach. Only 300 copies were printed, and Whitman
      signed the title page of each one. The volume also included the annex <em>Sands at Seventy</em> and his essay <em>A
         Backward Glance O'er Traveled Roads</em>. See Whitman's , letter to Oldach. For more
