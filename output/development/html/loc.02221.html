      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,       
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We were so delighted at receiving your books<sup><a href="#n1034" id="r1">1</a></sup>—&amp; <u>from you</u>. We have always intended owning them &amp; were only waiting to return to our little
      house in town. As we have now a volume belonging to
      
      
      
      Mr. Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Your poems have a great hold on us—&amp; grow more &amp; more to us in value.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In London last winter we saw the Gilchrists<sup><a href="#n3001" id="r3">3</a></sup> several times &amp; of course talked of you. Mrs. Gilchrist spoke most enthusiastically
      &amp; affectionately of you &amp; Mme. Modjeska<sup><a href="#n1031" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
      
      
      who was acting there wanted us to remind you of her having had the pleasure of meeting
      you—She is making a great success.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We read some of your poems to a group of people—artists etc., in London who were all
      intensely interested &amp; impressed—One, Alfred Hunt,<sup><a href="#n1032" id="r5">5</a></sup> the landscape painter, was much moved over some of the descriptions
      
      
      
      of nature. The mocking bird &amp; the pine trees especially. Richard talked about you with William M. Rossetti,<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r6">6</a></sup> your good friend, &amp; others who all were anxious to hear of you. Richard is very desirous
      to know whether you got some of your poems, done into Provençal, by W.C. Bonaparte
      Wyse.<sup><a href="#loc.02221_n1" id="r7">7</a></sup> Would you write a line
      
      
      
      of acknowledgement to the latter, to be forwarded through Richard. Mr. Wyse would
      value it very greatly.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr. Burroughs &amp; Richard were camping out in September &amp; there was a great deal of
      talk of W.W. under the pines beside the little Ulster Co. lake—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I know you love children and I wish I could show you my little boy, of whom I am very
      proud.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In February we will be again in our house &amp; hope to see you there once more.</p>
   
   
   <p>With renewed thanks I am dear Mr Whitman one of your sincerest admirers</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1034">1. Helena de Kay Gilder
      (1846–1916), the wife of poet and editor Richard Watson Gilder, was a
      painter as well as the founder of the Society of American Artists and the Art
      Student's League. She worked closely with her husband, designing the text
      illustrations for all of his books of poetry.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">2. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3001">3. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885), widow to Alexander Gilchrist, and her four children Beatrice,
      Grace, Percy and Herbert. Anne Gilchrist wrote one of the first significant
      pieces of criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's
      Estimate of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M.
      Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59.
      Gilchrist's long correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in
      love with the poet after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she
      visited Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. Anne's son Herbert (1857–1914) was
      a painter and shared his mother's fascination for Whitman. For more on Whitman
      and the Gilchrists, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1031">4. Helena Modjeska (1840–1909)
      was a well-known Polish actress, particularly famous for playing Shakespearean
      heroines. In 1878, Whitman met Modjeska while visiting with Richard Watson
      Gilder. The poet later said of the actress, "She is a fascinating, bright woman.
      I have never seen her act—saw her at Gilder's, in New York—handsome,
      agreeable, magnetic" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, [Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 1964],
      5:466).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1032">5. Alfred William Hunt
      (1830–1896) was an artist and the son of Andrew Hunt, an English landscape
      painter. Andrew attempted to push his son away from painting, but with the
      encouragement of John Ruskin, Alfred continued to exhibit his landscape
      paintings throughout his life and became known for his eye for details.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">6. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02221_n1">7. See the letter from Richard
      W. Gilder to Whitman of . William
      Charles Bonaparte-Wyse (1826–1892) was an Irish poet living in France. He
      had translated Whitman's "I Heard You Solemn-Sweet Pipes of the Organ" and
      "Reconciliation" into Provençal, a minority dialect of southern France. His
      parents were Sir Thomas Wyse, an Irish politician, and Marie Bonaparte, a French
      author. Bonaparte-Wyse was a great-nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte. He was married
      to Ellen Linzee Prout (1842–1925). For more about Wyse and his Whitman
      translations, see Thomas Donaldson, <em>Walt Whitman the Man</em>
      (New York: Francis P. Harper, 1896), 215–220.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0871">8. Richard Watson Gilder
      (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <em>The Century</em>, from 1881 until his death. Whitman had met
      Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1955], 482). Whitman attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
      Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the <em>New York Tribune</em>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder
      one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
      delirium" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">Sunday, August 5, 1888</a>). For more about Gilder, see Susan L.
      Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_95.html">Gilder, Richard Watson (1844–1909)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
