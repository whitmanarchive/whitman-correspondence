   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00673_n1">1. Minot Judson Savage
      (1841–1918) was a Congregational minister in his early years, but when he
      found himself deeply influenced by the theories of evolution, he decided to
      become a Unitarian. He published such works as <em>The Problem
         Attempted to be Solved by the Trinity and Science and the Church</em>. See
      also <em>Daybooks and Notebooks</em>, ed. William White (New York:
      New York University Press, 1977) 1:209.<a href="#r1">[back]
