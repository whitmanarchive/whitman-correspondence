      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have recd your postal handshake, and am glad to find that you appreciate my motives in writing
      to the English public on your behalf. Whatever comes of the appeal, nothing but good
      to you can come from this increased knowledge of you among general readers here; and
      that your apotheosis is at hand is abt as certain as that the sun shines and that great [
      <span class="unclear">Love?</span>]
       lives for ever. Every day widens your circle; every year sows your great seed deeper
      &amp; deeper in the hearts of men.
   </p>
   
   <p>You will already have heard from William Rossetti how he has [
      <span class="unclear">thriven?</span>]
       on your behalf. My second letter naturally turned the tide of [
      <span class="unclear">contributions?</span>]
       in his direction, as I desired, deeming him your very good friend, as indeed he seems
      to be! I am sending out, however, some ₤25 (particulars in other letter), including
      ₤5 from Tennyson, which came to me before I could answer Rossetti's letter. Since
      then Moncure Conway has denied authoritavely that you wanted money, &amp; I have been
      
      
      
      
      waiting &amp; wondering what to do. From your letters (which Rossetti has sent me for
      perusal) I pretty well perceive how matters stand, &amp; had, though not in actual [
      <span class="unclear">pricking?</span>]
       want, you really need and ought to have more money. Owing to the contradictions afloat,
      I have delayed putting your case before <u>personal friends</u>, &amp; the few friends I send are simply they tokens from the general public.
   </p>
   
   <p>You must forgive me for my blunder abt the price of your books. The result proves that very many people who admire you here
      cant afford such a high price as 2 guineas, &amp; you will therefore have to be content
      with a smaller circle of subscribers than you would otherwise get.
   </p>
   
   <p>What I want you to tell me forthwith is how far the sum already gathered between Rossetti
      &amp; myself—say ₤50 or so in all—will go to make you <u>temporarily</u> comfortable? There will doubtless be a heavy deduction in the cost of buying out
      your Beautiful Edition. But query, will the
      
      
      sum already gathered keep you going tolerably while other subscriptions are "dribbling"
      in? I wish I were a rich man—I am only an author living by his pen—and you should
      certainly never want anything your heart craved; but all I can do in my small way
      is to sing your praises wherever I can. (By the way, I enclose you a [
      <span class="unclear">portion?</span>]
       of the Gentleman's Magazine, with another letter of mine).
   </p>
   
   <p>I can conceive you [
      <span class="unclear">trailing?</span>]
       superbly as you survey the gnats of American [
      <span class="unclear">primalism?</span>]
       now [
      <span class="unclear">hovering?</span>]
       round your head. Thanks for your papers. When people become abusive, they have been
      touched to the quick, &amp; I am sure the [
      <span class="unclear">community?</span>]
       will do you good.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is with true grief that I read of your [
      <span class="unclear">sorry?</span>]
        health. Will you believe it, I had never heard of your condition until I read these
      [illegible] from the New Jersey Paper? Had I known of it sooner, you would certainly have heard
      from me—or even seen me—long ago. A year or two ago I had some correspondence with
      E. C. Stedman concerning you; and as far as I can gather, he
      
      
      is most hostile to your <u>poetic</u> claims. I found argument in vain, &amp; desisted. Stedman is a clever versewriter, without
      backbone or vice; &amp; there are many like him here &amp; even with you; but believe me,
      such men do not truly represent even the average intelligence of students, and your
      circle of readers is in the [illegible] above their heads.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is now a daily dream with me to see you &amp; know you, for ever so short a time, in
      the flesh. Whether or not that honour &amp; delight will be granted me, I shall never
      think of you but with love and honour, never speak or write of you without homage.
      Be happy, Whitman, in the severe certainty that you have fulfilled your life, &amp; spoken—in
      times no thunder can silence—the beautiful message you were fashioned to bring!
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Robert Buchanan (1841–1901), Scottish poet and
      critic, had lauded Whitman in the <em>Broadway Annual</em> in
      1867, and in 1872 praised Whitman but attributed his poor reception in England
      to the sponsorship of William Michael Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne.
      See Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in England</em> (1934),
      79–80, and Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em>
      (1955), 445–446. Swinburne's recantation later in 1872 may be partly
      attributable to Buchanan's injudicious remarks. For more on Buchanan, see Philip
      W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_91.html">Buchanan, Robert (1841–1901)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
