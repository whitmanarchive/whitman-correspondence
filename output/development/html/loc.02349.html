      <br></br><br></br>My dear Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Accept my best thanks for the beautiful copy of "Leaves of Grass."—What I love
      about that book is that it is filled with the spirit of freedom. Every line is
      manly, natural,
      independent, self poised, and in each is a superb personality. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You have given the world the [illegible]
      harvest of a great Grain. You have stood straight, erect, and have kept your hat on.
      There is no dust on your knees. I have taken the liberty to send you a copy of the last
      edition of Prose Poems. The title was given to the collection by my friend the
      publisher. So you will not hold me responsible for that. I think that you will like
      the articles on [illegible]—Art and
      Morality—life, and the [illegible].
      Of course you may not agree with all I say, but you have that splendid
      thing—"Intellectual Hospitality"—and that is enough.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Again, thanking you for the splendid Book wishing you many, many happy
      years—laurel-crowned—
   </p>

      I remain, yours always
      <br></br>R. G. Ingersoll

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).
