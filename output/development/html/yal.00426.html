   <p>I returned last evening from a jaunt to the country<sup><a href="#yal.00426_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—feel middling well again (about half-&amp;-half)—after a bad spell during March &amp; most
      of April—thought I was going to have a relapse to my old state, but the doctors say
      it was either only or mostly a bad case of <em>rheumatism</em><sup><a href="#yal.00426_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—(the best point about which seems to be that if it be ever so bad a devil itself,
      it generally keeps the coast clear of all other devils)—However, I am better at this
      writing, &amp; look forward to a tolerably fair summer—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The "Poetry of America" arrived, &amp; I am well content &amp; pleased with the part I am
      made to bear in it—Surely you have made a capital compilation &amp; condensation—the best
      thing of its sort &amp; size I have seen<sup><a href="#yal.00426_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Our friends the Gilchrists have broken camp in Philadelphia, &amp; gone (more or less
      temporarily) to Northampton, Mass:<sup><a href="#yal.00426_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—You will probably soon hear from (perhaps see) Herbert, the artist, the son—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I enclose a little printed slip—(or did I send it you before?)<sup><a href="#yal.00426_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Since my late sick spell, it is not so likely the programme will be carried out<sup><a href="#yal.00426_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—but I want to go about somewhat this summer—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00426_n1">1. In April, Whitman resumed
      his visits to the Staffords. He was at Kirkwood on April 20 and 21, April 25 to
      27, May 1 and 2, and May 6 and 7 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00426_n2">2. Interestingly, Whitman
      did not repeat Dr. S. Weir Mitchell's diagnosis. See the letter from Whitman to
      Louisa Orr Whitman of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00426_n3">3. Linton, a wood engraver,
      published <em>Poetry of America, 1776–1876</em> in London
      (G. Bell, 1878). The volume contained eight of Whitman's poems and Linton's
      engraving of the poet. See the letter from Whitman to Linton of .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00426_n4">4. The Gilchrists had left
      Philadelphia evidently late in April, since apparently Whitman saw them for the
      last time in Philadelphia on the evening of April 22 and 23 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00426_n5">5. Unquestionably "Walt
      Whitman for 1878," which appeared in the <em>West Jersey
         Press</em> of January 16, 1878, as noted in Whitman's Commonplace
      Book.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00426_n6">6. The New York lecture on
      Lincoln's death.<a href="#r6">[back]
