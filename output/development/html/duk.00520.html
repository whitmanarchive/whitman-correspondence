   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00520_n16">1. March 20, 1868 is the
      most likely date for this letter; however, March 13 and March 27, 1868 are
      also possible. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter only "friday
      afternoon." The letter may date to March 13, 1868, as suggested by Richard
      Maurice Bucke. Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver assigned the same date
      (<em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt
         Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University
      Press, 1949], 194), and Edwin Haviland Miller cited Gohdes and Silver's date
      (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:365). The evidence for dating the letter
      to March 13, 1868 is indirect, and the letter more probably dates to a week
      or two later.<br><br>
      Attorney General Richard Stanberry resigned his office on March 12, 1868 to
      serve as legal counsel during Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial. Walt
      Whitman served as a clerk in the office of the attorney general, and Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman conveyed her discussion with son George Washington
      Whitman about Walt's prospects after Stanberry was replaced. March 12, 1868,
      a Friday, is therefore the earliest possible date for the letter. The
      letter, however, mentions a recent letter from Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, and Louisa had also acknowledged a previous letter from Jeff in her
       letter to Walt. If both of
      Louisa's letters refer to the same letter from Jeff, March 13, 1868 is the
      correct date. But since Louisa conveyed no news from Jeff nor from Martha
      Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (Jeff's wife), the letter presumably acknowledges
      a later but non-extant letter from Jeff. Because Jeff was overwhelmed with
      work, it is unlikely that he wrote two letters to his mother within the span
      of three days; therefore, March 20, 1868 is a more probable date for this
      letter.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00520_n1">2. Edwin Haviland Miller dated
      this lost letter from Walt Whitman to March 12, 1868 ((Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:360). If the present letter dates to March 20 or March 27,
      1868, which is more likely than March 13, Walt's lost letter would also date a
      week or two later.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00520_n2">4. Walt Whitman's mid- or late
      March 1868 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">5. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">6. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00520_n4">7. Ann (or Anna) and Esther Van
      Wyck (also spelled "Van Wycke") were sisters. Ellen Van Wyck was an in-law. Anna
      Van Wyck had boarded with the Whitmans in Brooklyn, and the Van Wyck family farm
      was near Colyer farm, which had belonged to Jesse Whitman, Walt Whitman's
      paternal grandfather. See Bertha H. Funnel, <em>Whitman on Long
         Island</em> (Port Washington, New York: Kennikat Press, 1971), 78. John
      Robbins Baylis (1838–1882?) married Esther Van Wycke (1838–1913) on
      October 1, 1857 (http://www.longislandsurnames.com).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00520_n5">8. Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G.
      Silver transcribed the name as "Varny" (<em>Faint Clews &amp;
         Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North
      Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 195), but Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      probably wrote "John vanwy," a shortened spelling of Van Wyck (or Van Wycke).
      John Van Wyck has not been identified, but he was probably a relative of Anna or
      Esther Van Wyck.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00520_n6">9. Ursula North
      (1836–1917) married John Burroughs in 1857 and became a friend to Walt
      Whitman, a frequent guest in the Burroughs household. The marriage faltered over
      matters of sexual incompatibility, and Whitman sided with Ursula against John's
      sexual "wantonness" and eventual infidelity. John Burroughs traveled a great
      deal for his job as a bank examiner, and Ursula and Whitman visited frequently,
      with Ursula visiting the poet after his stroke in 1873. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with the Burroughses, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula
         [1836–1917]</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00470_n8">10. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
      and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00520_n15">11. Mrs. Black was a neighbor
      of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. She is also mentioned in Louisa's  and  letters to Walt.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00520_n14">12. The United States House of
      Representatives voted to bring articles of impeachment against President Andrew
      Johnson on February 24, 1868. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman commented on the House
      speeches prior to the vote in her  letter to Walt.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00520_n8">13. James Speed
      (1812–1887), attorney general under Abraham Lincoln, continued to serve
      under President Andrew Johnson but resigned in July 1866 over Reconstruction
      policies. Henry Stanbery (1803–1881) succeeded Speed, and he resigned on
      March 12, 1868, the month of this letter, to serve as President Johnson's
      counsel during the impeachment trial. Walt Whitman had served as clerk in the
      office of the attorney general under Speed and Stanbery. He continued to serve
      under Orville Browning (1806–1881), a temporary stand-in after Stanbery
      resigned, and under William M. Evarts (1818–1901), who succeeded Browning.
      For Whitman's assessment of his prospects during this unsettled period,
      including concern that James Harlan, who had fired him previously, might be
      reappointed, see his  letter to Abby
      H. Price.<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00520_n17">14. The first six or so letters
      of the word "impeachment" are inserted above the words "not but"; however, no
      mark indicates the place of insertion. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman presumably
      intended to write "articles of impeachment," inadvertently omitted the word
      "impeachment," and inserted the partial word in the available space.<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00520_n9">15. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      likely refers to the Baltimore <em>Sun</em>, which was known for
      its political coverage, but it is not known which election she was following. In
      March 1868 the <em>Sun</em> reported election results in Maryland
      (March 7), New Hampshire (March 10 and 16), Kentucky (March 10), Alabama (March
      11), Louisiana (March 13), Florida (March 16), and Connecticut (March
      18).<a href="#r15">[back]
