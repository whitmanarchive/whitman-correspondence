      great loss, and she too recall Jeff<sup><a href="#n4995" id="r3">3</a></sup> in Brooklyn—his guitar—his close bond of friendship with you—closer as it were than
      a brother.
      She is allmost seriously ill,—jaundice, nervousness, debility, and yet striving to maintain
      her home / our house. Bingham re-iterates that she must be kept warmer. I have written
      to Lou<sup><a href="#n0368" id="r4">4</a></sup>—she needs a long, heavy, wollen stocking
      that will expand when drawn on. I have connected my stove with hers in bedroom, by
      adding more pipe and elbows, at a cost of 1 dollar, which I told 
      the worker he could send for, to Mrs. Lou Whitman, Burlington New Jersey—as before—Weather
      has been severely cold, moderating to day, with snow.
      I have no money am out at 10 dollars, interest 1 year—at Bank—due 10th Nov. not quite
      out of coal yet.

      Your kindness we appreciate every hour in the day. "O Walt" is so good.
