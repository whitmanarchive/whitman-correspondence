      <br xmlns="" class="opener">February 2nd, 1879.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Darling Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I read your long piece in the Philadelphia <em>Times</em> with ever so much interest, &amp; with especial delight the delicately told bit about
      the dear old Pond, artistic, because so true.<sup><a href="#n3011" id="r2">2</a></sup> I know that it will please you to hear that I have gained tenfold facility with my
      brush since the autumn. It has agreed uncommonly well with me having enlisted under
      such an experienced &amp; able painter as Chase;<sup><a href="#n1510" id="r3">3</a></sup> as a manipulator of the brush he is agreed by the experts (Eaton)<sup><a href="#upa.00172_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> to have no rival. I may yet be able to paint a head of you in <em>one</em> sitting that will do justice to you. Three of my pictures are nicely hung at the
      Water Colour Exhibition Academy of Design, the first time that I have exhibited in
      New York. We had two &amp; three engagements every night (with one exception) last week,
      &amp; go to Mrs. Croley's to-night. Your friend John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r5">5</a></sup> called last Wednesday—came to try Turkish baths for his malarious trouble, but it
      seemed to bring on his attacks of neuralgia worse. I am sorry that I can report but
      poorly of his health, so painfully excruciating was his neuralgia about his arms at
      times that a Dr. was sent for &amp; morphia injected in his wrist, but I am glad to say
      he reported himself a little better. He hopes that you will come and give the lecture
      on Lincoln this winter; why not, confound it, it would be most interesting.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Quite often we go to Miss Booth's<sup><a href="#n3017" id="r6">6</a></sup> receptions. Saturday evening, they are gay &amp; amusing. Met Mr. Bliss, the gentleman
      that talked like "a house afire" one Sunday at your house last winter, you remember.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Last Wednesday I, mother, Giddy,<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r7">7</a></sup> &amp; Kate Hillard<sup><a href="#n0302" id="r8">8</a></sup> went to Mrs. Bigelow's<sup><a href="#n1509" id="r9">9</a></sup> reception. Miss H. was asked to recite &amp; she recited the "Swineherd" (Anderson's)<sup><a href="#n0041" id="r10">10</a></sup> charmingly, &amp; "The Faithful Lovers," which took every one. "Walk in" Miller<sup><a href="#n0412" id="r11">11</a></sup> was there (I can't spell his name) &amp; lots more.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This morning being Sunday, I took my skates to the Park. The wind was high &amp; whirled
      us about fantastically; ladies seated in wicker chairs were pushed rapidly along the
      Pond's smooth icy surface by their gentlemen escorts, tall men kissed the ice or sprawled
      full length on their backs, while others flew by like swallows; all this with a church
      spire peeping behind hills dappled with snow &amp; sunshine: what more inspiriting than
      this?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And now dear Walt.</p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Good-bye for the present.
      <br></br>Herbert H. Gilchrist.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0262">1. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3011">2. On January 26, 1879, the
      Philadelphia <em>Times</em> published Walt Whitman's article
      "Winter Sunshine. A Trip from Camden to the Coast." Paragraph 31 of the piece
      was titled "A July Afternoon by the Pond" when it was later included in <em>Specimen Days</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1510">3. William Merritt Chase
      (1849–1916) was an American impressionist painter. In 1878 he began
      teaching at the New York City Art Students League, where Herbert Gilchrist
      became his student.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00172_n3">4. Wyatt Eaton
      (1849–1896), an American portrait and figure painter, organized the
      Society of American Artists in 1877. Whitman met Eaton at a reception given by
      Richard W. Gilder on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation," <em>New
         York Tribune</em>, July 4, and <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in
         Canada</em>, ed. William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard &amp;
      Company, 1904), 54.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">5. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3017">6. Mary Louise Booth (1831–1889)
      was the first editor of the New York-based <em>Harper's
         Bazaar</em>, one of the first fashion magazines of its time. Booth also
      translated around 40 works of French literature and wrote a history of New York.
      For more on Booth and the <em>Bazaar</em>, see Paula Bernat
      Bennett, "Subtle Subversion: Mary Louise Booth and <em>Harper's
         Bazaar</em> (1867–1889)," in <em>Blue Pencils &amp;
         Hidden Hands: Women Editing Periodicals, 1830–1910</em> (Boston:
      Northeastern University Press, 2004), 225–247.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0890">7. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0302">8. Katharine Hillard (1839?–1915) was the translator of
      Dante's <em>Banquet</em> (1889) and the editor of <em>An Abridgment by Katharine Hillard of the Secret Doctrine: A
         Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy by Helena Petrovna
         Blavatsky</em> (1907). A Brooklyn resident, she was a friend of Abby Price
      (see Whitman's , letter to
      Price); in fact, according to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter to Helen Price
      on November 26, 1872, the Prices expected that Arthur Price and Katharine
      Hillard would marry (Pierpont Morgan Library). Whitman had known Hillard's
      writings since 1871 and mentioned her in his , letter to Charles Eldridge. He sent her a copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> on July 27, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book). Writing to Whitman on ,
      Moncure D. Conway quoted from a letter sent to him by Katharine Hillard: "I have
      made a discovery since I have been here [in the Adirondacks], and that is, that
      I never half appreciated Walt Whitman's poetry till now, much as I fancied I
      enjoyed it. To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the only
      one who can reach and level their lift, to use his own words, to pass and
      continue beyond" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell
      Kennerley, 1914], 3:112). The first meeting of the poetess with Whitman took
      place on February 28, 1876.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1509">9. Jane Tunis Poultney Bigelow
      (1829–1889) was the wife of John Bigelow, former American minister to
      France (1865–1866) and coeditor, with William Cullen Bryant, of the New
      York <em>Evening Post</em>.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0041">10. Hans Christian Andersen was a Danish author and poet
      best known for his fairy tales.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0412">11. Joaquin Miller was the pen name of Cincinnatus Heine
      Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of the Rockies" and
      "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <em>Westminster Review</em>
      described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness which marked Walt Whitman's
      poetry." In an entry in his journal dated August 1, 1871, John Burroughs
      recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's poetry; see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin Co., 1931), 60. Whitman met Miller for the first time later in 1872; he
      wrote of a visit with Miller in a 
      letter to Charles W. Eldridge.<a href="#r11">[back]
