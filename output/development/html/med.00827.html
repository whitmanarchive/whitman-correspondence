      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have hoped daily to write in reply to your letters of April 8th and 23d, and the
      postal card of May 7th, but between office business and illness I have been
      prevented. Last night I got another of May 14th, covering the one from Herbert
      Gilrchrist,<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r1">1</a></sup> which I send today to Doctor Bucke,<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> as you desire. I am grieved to learn by these last advices
      that you are ill lately. Your trouble all through seems twin to
      mine—semi-paralysis, indigestion, constipation, etc. But who can be well, or
      who being sick can help being sicker, in such weather as we have had this spring?
      The last five days have been simply horrible—cold, wet, raw, diabolical, and
      we are all the worse for it. I think we will have to do like the
      Greenlanders—when the weather is bad, they boil the thermometer!
   </p>
   
   <p>I saw your little piece in the Herald of the 14th.<sup><a href="#med.00827_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> No fear of your distempers getting
      into your compositions! Your temperament is indomitable. One would think you had the
      
      sun for a solar plexus. I basked in the mellowness of your last letters as in the
      gold and azure October weather of which I am so fond. I often feel deep regret that
      you should have become ill. It simply proves the existence of the devil, whom Starr
      King<sup><a href="#n4263" id="r4">4</a></sup> called the fourth person of the Trinity! (Certainly he's powerful enough to be
      so styled.) But for him, or what he stands for, you might have reached a hundred,
      hale, sturdy, impregnable, and like the best druid of the grove. So may it be
      yet!
   </p> 
   
   <p>I read with a jovial heart of your trencher work at the planked shad and champagne
      up
      at the old tavern on the Delaware,<sup><a href="#nyp.00712_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> and, later, with your friends, where champagne
      and oysters ruled the board. Didn't I wish to be along! Didn't my lower stomach
      shout to my upper stomach with loud halloos!  O there's fun in this sad world yet!
      I hope you'll have lots of it.
   </p> 
   
   <p>Apropos of the Devil, I once had a conception of him, which I worked out in an
      unpublished romance thirty years ago, as a type of intellectual ignorance—that
      is, of word-knowledge as against the knowledge of things. Lately, I had another and
      more grotesque conception of such a being, supernatural and immortal, but, simply
      having all the diseases! Wouldn't be a bad idea, would it? How very diabolic such
      a devil would naturally be, wouldn't he?
   </p> 
   
   <p>Herbert Gilchrist's letter was very interesting. His reference to your bust would
      have been very enigmatical, but for a card I had from Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      which helped me to infer that it was Morse's<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r7">7</a></sup> bust that was
      alluded to.
   </p>
   
   <p>In a couple of days the weather will change for the better, and you will feel
      revived. I hope you will ride out all you can in the Spring air.
   </p>
   
   <p>You speak of Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton<sup><a href="#n4264" id="r8">8</a></sup> having been to see you. It is many years
      since I saw her. She used to be very pretty: I hope she is yet. Her fault was in
      being too Araminta-Seraphina-Matilda, and this, life has made her outgrow.
   </p>
   
   <p>I had a letter from Ben Tucker<sup><a href="#n4290" id="r9">9</a></sup> about you and your Herald threnody on the Emperor<sup><a href="#med.00827_n1" id="r10">10</a></sup>
      (which I have never seen). He seemed much troubled and cast down. Undoubtedly, he
      has a great regard and veneration for you, and feels hurt.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am delighted at your returns from the Herald, and hope they will continue. Bennett<sup><a href="#n3168" id="r11">11</a></sup>
      is certainly the most generous of all the blackguards.
   </p>
   
   <p>You speak of having the bust of Elias Hicks,<sup><a href="#n4265" id="r12">12</a></sup> which must be a grateful possession.<sup><a href="#med.00827_n3" id="r13">13</a></sup> I
      hope your article on him is growing.<sup><a href="#med.00827_n4" id="r14">14</a></sup> You ought to make it good, and as elaborate as
      possible.
   </p>
   
   <p>Miserable Cosmopolitan!—to refuse the Lilt of Songs,<sup><a href="#nyp.00718_n5" id="r15">15</a></sup> which has a real and deep 
      thought! Such are these demons.
   </p>
   
   <p>I had your Critic Thought on Shakespeare,<sup><a href="#med.00827_n5" id="r16">16</a></sup> and read it many times lately again. It is
      certainly very satisfactory, though I could wish it had certain explanations and
      expansions.
   </p>
   
   <p>Donnelly's<sup><a href="#n4108" id="r17">17</a></sup> book is out, and I have gone through it, though
      hurriedly and in illness. He has done something I don't like—withheld a part
      of the explanation of the cipher, and moreover expounded it so bewilderingly as to
      leave the matter still in debate. Still, the effect is rather tremendous, and
      although the chief journals denounce and lampoon it with all their armory of lying,
      misrepresentation and persiflage, I don't think any fair mind can doubt the validity
      of the cryptograph. The general abuse and ridicule are consoled, so far, by
      Professor Colbert of Chicago vouching for the reality of the figures, and by Mr.
      Bidder, one of the best mathematicians in England, declaring that the cipher is
      surely in the test. But that my illness makes me unfit for composition, I would like
      to review Donnelly's reviewers so far, and would engage to make them skip. Such
      ignorance and such impudence I have rarely seen. The fragments of the cipher story
      in the book are quite amazing and have wonderful vraisemblance. He has a notice of
      me, with other Baconians, and briefly pays good tribute to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>You speak truly of the beautiful hue of the young wheat. I have sometimes thought
      that "wheat-color" would be a justified and telling epithet. The tint is so
      peculiar, so <em>living</em>.
   </p>
   
   <p>By the way, in looking over Stedman's<sup><a href="#n1043" id="r18">18</a></sup> book (the Poets of
      America) I saw how thoroughly and even radically he had modified the article on you.
      It is by no means what it was in the magazine. My talk with him must have sunk
      in.
   </p>
   
   <p>Goodbye. Nelly<sup><a href="#n4305" id="r19">19</a></sup> sends you her love. So do I. Always
      affectionately

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="nyp.00712_n2">5. William J. "Billy" Thompson
      (1848–1911), known as "The Duke of Gloucester" and "The Statesman," was a
      friend of Whitman's who operated a hotel, race track, and amusement park on the
      beach overlooking the Delaware River at Gloucester, New Jersey. His shad and
      champagne dinners for Whitman were something of a tradition. See William Sloane
      Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> (1896),

      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,

      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,

   <p id="n4305">19. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor. Walt may have mentioned a potential visit by Nelly
      and her daughter during his May visit to Brooklyn, though whether a visit came
      near this time is not known from his or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters.
      Walt Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington years,
      and he spoke often in his letters of their daughter Jean (called "Jenny" or
      "Jeannie"). Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off
      their friendship in late 1872 over a disagreement about Reconstruction policies
      and the role of emancipated slaves, Nelly would remain friendly with
      Whitman.<a href="#r19">[back]
