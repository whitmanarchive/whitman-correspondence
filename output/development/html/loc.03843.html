      My dear friend,
      
      
   </p>  
   
   <p>
      Thank you—thank you! for several kind remembrences of you in periodicals and for
      your letter &amp; postal, all of which bridge even the great separating waters of the
      
      Atlantic. Our Alys<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> will have before this seen you, I trust, 
      and given us a picture of how you fare in these days. Having got through the murderous
      
      heats of the Camden summer, I greatly
      
      hope that you will have a cheerful winter. I would that I could look in on you now
      &amp; 
      then in your wilderness of books &amp; papers! With much to bring pleasure to you from
      
      far &amp; near—the hearty tribute of reverence and affection from those whose lives 
      you have helped to illuminate &amp; cheer, yet I know that there must be mixed with it
      
      physical &amp; mental heart sinkings when the unsolved, unsolvable problems of sin, pain,
      
      sorrow &amp; the unrevealed future
      
      must press upon spirits more or less controlled by physical depression.

      As Keeble

      —"the nearest 
      heart &amp; next our own, 
      knows not one half the reasons why we smile or sigh"—and down in the depths of 
      unrevealable consciousness, the problems are fought out—alas! with what small results
      
      of certitude. Not a few of us have met great audiences with bold words while the depths
      
      of purgatory were being stirred up within us! 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      Well, dear Comrade, we are helpless—we must go on with the deepest problems unsolved,
      
      &amp; face pain, grief, loneliness, death bravely as we can. From the condition of my
      heart 
      death is a daily probability to my conciousness 
      &amp; I face all my [illegible] in the sense that it 
      <u>may</u> be for me the last time. And yet I find that I can do it cheerfully 
      &amp; can plan &amp; work as though I had a century before me.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      You have many, many friends among the young &amp; earnest in whose unsoiled 
      [illegible] natures your bracing, 
      [illegible]/words 
      
      find a quick lively response.

      In our country home at Haslemere—close, by the way, to Tennysons<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r2">2</a></sup> 
      home—are many highly cultivated people who love you. Alys will tell you how like 
      paradise our home there is—and how often we have wished that we might have you there
      to 
      drive around the beautiful hills, two thirds in woods &amp; undergrowth for miles. I had
      hoped 
      to guide you across the ocean &amp; but I fear that we may not now hope for that.
