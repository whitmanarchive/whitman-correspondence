   </p>
   
   <p>I received your letter of yesterday morning.<sup><a href="#loc.00398_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I am glad to hear that you are still visiting the hospitals and doing so much good.
      We are trying to do what little we can to furnish you with the necessary funds (in
      a small way to be sure) and the only thing that we are sorry about is that we cannot
      do more. The enclosed money is contributed by

   </p>
   
   
   <p>both of whom are employed on the work under Mr Lane.<sup><a href="#loc.00398_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr Lane has written a letter to <em>Mr Webster</em>
      <sup><a href="#loc.00398_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> the clerk of Seward<sup><a href="#loc.00398_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> that I spoke to you about and will send you a letter of introduction to him immediately.
      He tells me that he (Webster) is a "politician" and that he will help you without
      doubt provided that he thinks that it will not interfere at all with him. Or that
      is about the idea of what he said.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all getting well at home &nbsp;Sis has almost entirely recovered &nbsp;Mat's throat is
      still quite sore and mothers cough <em>was</em> a great deal better, till she went and caught more but she is again getting well.
      We do not hear any more from Heyde so I presume that Han is getting better again and
      perhaps will soon be home. I hope so anyway
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope that George may be successful in getting his furlough.<sup><a href="#loc.00398_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> I saw Capt. Simms<sup><a href="#loc.00398_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> Sunday night, he had left George and the rest on Thursday morning. He was then well
      and engaged in building his hut. Simms looks very well indeed. My old friend Bill
      DeBevoise<sup><a href="#loc.00398_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> is home sick with "<em>weakness</em>" I suppose you might call it. He can hardly walk alone &nbsp;He has been home about 2
      weeks and has got so he can just get about a little. My friend J. W. Mason,<sup><a href="#loc.00398_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> (used to be in my party on the Water Works) was in Brooklyn on Saturday &nbsp;He was then
      on his way to his fathers at Towando, Pa. and promised that he would call on you when
      he returned to the army &nbsp;He is now a Capt. in the regulars. (5th Cavalry)
   </p>
   
   <p>I think I shall take a few of your letters and give them to George Wright<sup><a href="#loc.00398_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup> (of the ferry) and let him see if he cannot collect a few dollars from the ferry
      hands &nbsp;dont you think it would be a good idea. I think that he might be able to collect something
      quite handsome. I have not seen any of the ferry hands since you went away.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We often wish that you and George could pop in on us just as we were about to sit
      down to dinner, particularly when we have "Turk" as sis calls it. Mother eats with
      us at almost every meal and I think living well is about all that keeps her up through
      all the trouble and worry that she goes through, for work and worry she will and I
      dont think the power of man can prevent it. Mat is nearly the same as usual &nbsp;she is
      not very well and sometimes has to give up for a little while, but she soon buckels in again. Sis of course when she is well is just as big a little scamp as ever, more
      mischief-making than ever, if that is possible. Jess and Ed are I guess, in every
      respect are just the same. I met Andrew Rome,<sup><a href="#loc.00398_n12" id="r12">12</a></sup> 'tother day, he wanted to know how soon you would be in Brooklyn again &nbsp;I told him I did
      not know and asked him to write you. How would it do for you to write to Wilke,<sup><a href="#loc.00398_n13" id="r13">13</a></sup> detailing what you are doing, what we have contributed so that he might strike some
      of the big-bugs that he moves among or shall I give him the letters that you have
      written to us. advise me about it
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr Lane has about finished his reports and wishes me to tell you that he will now
      have some time to devote and thinks he will be able to raise some more money, however
      he will write you himself before long, a day or two.
   </p>
   
   <p>What about your chances for the "position" and what kind of a position do you expect
      to get. I sincerely hope that you might succeed and get detailed to New York.<sup><a href="#loc.00398_n14" id="r14">14</a></sup> Try for it Walt and dont be discouraged if you do not succeed at first
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you write to dear brother George often, I wish he could honorably get out of it.
      Would'nt it be good if he was home just now to build my "house" &nbsp;I should like much to have
      it done by him, let him get a gang of men and pay him by the day. However I suppose
      it cannot be done in that manner and shall have to do it in some other.
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Walt let me hear from you soon. All send their love to you and receive my best
      wishes for your health and success &nbsp;I remain as ever your affectionate brother

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
      and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter of
      , and later various sums which
      Whitman acknowledged in letters from , , , and . In his letter of , Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in the
      Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman wrote,
      obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of money,
      contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly
      through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted Whitman
      in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from , and ). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal welfare that on , he sent through Jeff $5 "for your
      own especial benefit."<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.00398_n8">8. Samuel H. Sims, a
      captain in George's Fifty-first New York Volunteer Regiment, had been the
      subject in part of Walt Whitman's article, "Our Brooklyn Boys in the War," which
      appeared in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, on January 5, 1863.
      Sims died on July 30, 1864, of wounds received near Petersburg, Virginia (see
      George Washington Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from ). Walt Whitman may have lived in
      Sims's tent during part of his stay at Falmouth, Virginia, opposite
      Fredericksburg—a trip that Walt took in search of George after reading his
      brother's name in the <em>New York Herald</em> listed among the
      wounded in the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862. As it turned out,
      George only suffered a minor injury; George wrote in a letter to his mother on
      : "I have come out safe and
      sound, although I had the side of my jaw slightly scraped with a peice of shell
      which burst at my feet."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00398_n9">9. Formerly a bookkeeper
      and clerk, William H. DeBevoise was now serving in the Union army. He was a
      member of a large, established family that had lived in Brooklyn at least thirty
      years. There was a DeBevoise Street in Brooklyn as early as 1859.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00398_n10">10. After working for the
      Brooklyn Water Works, Julius ("Jule") Mason became a career army officer. With
      his help Jeff and Walt Whitman were later able to get provisions to George when
      he was a prisoner of war (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1977], 37). Jeff accidentally spells "Towanda" as "Towando."<a href="#r10">[back]

      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00398_n13">13. Probably George Wilkes
      (1820?–1885), owner of the New York paper, <em>Wilkes'
         Spirit of the Times</em> (formerly edited by William T. Porter). Wilkes was
      known for his strong antislavery, pro-Union views, which may be why Jeff thought
      he would support Walt Whitman's work. Wilkes was also among the first to
      advocate a transcontinental railroad, having published a pamphlet, <em>Project for a National Railroad from the Atlantic to the
         Pacific Ocean</em>, in 1845.<a href="#r13">[back]

   <p id="loc.00398_n14">14. Walt Whitman did not
      find full-time government work until January 24, 1865, when he became a
      first-class clerk in the Indian Affairs Office, Department of the Interior,
      Washington, D.C. There is no record of his looking for work in New York.<a href="#r14">[back]
