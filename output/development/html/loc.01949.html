      <br></br><br></br>My dear Friend, Mr. Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your letter by Monday 
      evenings
      
       mail.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I did not expect to hear from you so soon after writing nevertheless, I was just as
      glad to hear from you, I wrote in my last letter that we know nothing about uncle
      George. well, shortly after I had written to you we received a letter from him. this
      was on Friday night, and on the preceeding Saturday I went to 
      N.Y.
      
       (the first time I had even been there alone). I 
      croosed
      
       over on 23rd
      
      St.
      
       Ferry, walked to 9<u>th</u>
      
      Ave.
      
       and took the cars to 
      W.
      
       43rd
      
      St.
      
       where I found uncle George at 
      No.
      
       35, so, if you will do <u>him</u>, as well as me, the
      favor of writing to him, you will please both of us, direct to 
      No.
      
       35 
      W.
      
       43 
      St.
      
       I suppose you know Arthur Henry. well, he is keeping the place
      near the 5<u>th</u>
      
      Ave.
      
       Stage Stables, and there is where George's staying. since Papa
      saw him, he has had very sore feet and legs, so bad that he could not have worked,
      even if he had had it. they were considerable better when I was there. I got there
      about 10 o'clock, and took dinner with him, then we went down to Fulton Ferry, with
      Asik Speer, a 5th
      
      Ave.
      
       driver, and a good friend of Uncle George. I guess you dont know Speer, he
      belongs in Paterson.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>well, we went to Fulton Ferry, and I <u>was</u> to take boat from
      Peck's ship to go and out on 
      L. I.
      
       but, the boat was not running, so I crossed from James's ship to Hunter's
      [illegible] and look
      the cars from [illegible]
      to Great Neck. I have a cousin living there whom I went to visit. I left Uncle
      George at James' Ship. I suppose you have read all about the new P.O. in 
      N.Y.
      
       It is a splendid building and is nearly finished. The Astor house has sold
      out its old Furniture and everything, and the building itself is undergoing repair
      the inside and front are all taken out, and it is to be fined up <u>splendid</u>. The East River bridge does not seem to be
      getting on very fast I believe the [
      <span class="unclear">pairs?</span>]
      
       are not quite finished. I suppose you have heard that several of
      convicts have escaped from Blackwells, and Boss Tweed is to be released. Dan Bryant died, a week ago
      last Saturday.

   <p>The weather here, is remarkably cold for the time of year, it freezes <u>hard</u> every night. April 16<u>th</u>, there fell 11 inches of snow and people rode
      with the sleigh, there are no gardens made yet, but I have plants in my hot bed big
      enough to be transplanted. Papa wrenched his back last Thursday, and has been laid
      up ever since.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am not much of a young man yet, I am 17 years old, all but a few days, but very
      small for my age I would not be taken for more than 13
   </p>
   
   <p>I go to school every day, answer soon</p>

      were not very well
