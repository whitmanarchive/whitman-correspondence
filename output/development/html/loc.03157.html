   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had proposed to be over yesterday, but the rain set in, &amp; [
      <span class="unclear">minus an umbrella?</span>]
      . I
      concluded to stay home &amp; paint. I have the President about finished off.<sup><a href="#loc.03157_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Hope to cast him, for good or ill, Wednesday, &amp; get
      him on exhibition.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have painted 2 heads of yourself, &amp;  will bring them over. Have not
      been very well, so have had to keep quiet &amp; stay 
      in doors
      
      , in order to put in some time at work. I think the president looks <u>well</u>. I wish if it is a pleasant day tomorrow, you would
      get up courage ride over &amp; make a call, &amp; see  for yourself how the "head (&amp;
      body) of the Nation looks."
   </p>
   
   <p>The boxes were shipped Monday, &amp; I suppose you may have heard from Dr Bucke.<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Tell Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r4">4</a></sup> to look after the "hens &amp; things" in the
      back yard &amp; I will be greatly obliged. I sent Smith  with your bust,<sup><a href="#loc.02912_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> an Emerson<sup><a href="#loc.03157_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; two of the
      medallions.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you are as well as usual.</p>
   
   <p>If Herbert comes in today or tomorrow, ask him if 
      wont
      
       come &amp; see me at <u>136 N. 17</u>. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This rain will settle things for the big Centennial—</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03157_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked: Richmond | Dec [illegible] | [illegible] | 87; Camden. N. J. | DEC | 27 | 7AM | [illegible] | Re[illegible].<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03157_n2">2. Morse produced a statuette
      of President Grover Cleveland in 1887.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6113">4. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_92.html">Davis, Mary Oakes (1837 or 1838–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.02912_n3">5. A reference to Sidney
      Morse's 1887 clay bust of Whitman—apparently the poet's favorite depiction
      of himself at the time. A photo of it would later become the frontispiece of
      Horace Traubel's 1889 <em>Camden's Compliments to Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay), one of the first print-collections
      of Whitman's letters, addresses and notes.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03157_n3">6. The sculptor produced a
      plaster head of Emerson that was much admired by Emerson's friends and
      family.<a href="#r6">[back]
