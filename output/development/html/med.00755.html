   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0117">1. Robert Buchanan (1841–1901), Scottish poet and
      critic, had lauded Whitman in the <em>Broadway Annual</em> in
      1867, and in 1872 praised Whitman but attributed his poor reception in England
      to the sponsorship of William Michael Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne.
      See Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in England</em> (1934),
      79–80, and Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em>
      (1955), 445–446. Swinburne's recantation later in 1872 may be partly
      attributable to Buchanan's injudicious remarks. For more on Buchanan, see Philip
      W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_91.html">Buchanan, Robert (1841–1901)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00755_n1">2. Buchanan's <em>A Look Round Literature</em> (1887) contains a chapter on Walt
      Whitman entitled "The American Socrates," in which he describes Whitman as "the
      wisest and noblest, the most truly great, of all modern literary men" (345).
      Buchanan goes on to write, "We have a beautiful singer in Tennyson, and some day
      it will be among Tennyson's highest honours that he was once named kindly and
      appreciatively by Whitman" (346).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3080">3. John Hay (1838–1905) was Abraham
      Lincoln's private secretary and a historian as well as Secretary of State under
      Theodore Roosevelt. Hay praised Whitman's "A Death-Sonnet for Custer" (later
      entitled "From Far Dakota's Cañons") when it appeared in the New York <em>Daily Tribune</em> on July 10, 1876. Whitman sent the 1876
      Centennial Edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> to Hay on August 1,
      1876 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00755_n2">4. Hay acknowledged receipt
      of the books on  and sent the poet
      $30 as thanks for a copy of "O Captain! My Captain!" that Whitman copied by
      hand and sent along with the books to the historian.<a href="#r4">[back]
