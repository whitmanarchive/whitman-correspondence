   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman began his correspondence with
      soldier Byron Sutherland on . In
      April 1870, Sutherland was teaching in Jamestown, N. Y. In reply to Walt
      Whitman's request for further information about his life, the former soldier
      observed on : "You remember me in
      1865 a green vain(?) lad of Eighteen—without, even, an imperfect knowledge of
      the rudimentary English branches, I came home from Washington and applied
      myself, as soon as possible, to school and to study . . . My life since we
      parted that July day upon the Treasury steps, has been one of hard work and
      little recreation—I find on looking back to that time, that I am not so pure or
      trusting—that the world isint quite so fair and beautiful as it seemed then—That
      the world is not precisely a green pasture for unsophistocated human lambs to
      skip in—That I like dreaming less, and work or excitement better—That I have
      lost a great deal of Ambition, and gained a like quantity of stupidity— That I
      dont know nearly so much as I once supposed I did."

   <p id="n0595">1. The State Normal School in
      Edinboro, Pennsylvania, was first chartered in 1856 as an academy; it became a
      normal school, meant for the training of teachers, in 1861. The normal school
      phenomenon had only recently caught on in the U.S., where the first normal
      school was established in Massachusetts in 1839.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0438">2. In its July 1868 edition, the <em>New
         Eclectic Magazine</em> published a translation of Ferdinand Freiligrath's
      "Walt Whitman," which had originally appeared in the Augsburg <em>Allgemeine Zeitung</em> on April 24, 1868. Freiligrath (1810–1876)
      was a German poet and translator and friend of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. "Walt
      Whitman" was among the first notices of Walt Whitman's poetry on the continent.
      A digital version is available in Walter Grünzweig's "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/german/introduction.html">Whitman in the German-Speaking Countries</a>," which collects several
      examples of German reception of Whitman's poetry.<a href="#r2">[back]
