      <br></br><br></br>Dearest friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>After a couple of weeks in New York, Mr Burroughs has brought me up here, where I
      am to stay for a few days—Every thing goes well—I am very comfortably situated, &amp;
      it is not only a great change from N Y—but a great relief—I mean the excitement of so much company—every thing is quiet
      &amp; secluded here—all winter too, the snow white &amp; deep in every direction—as I look
      from my window, river &amp; mountains &amp; trees &amp; rocks—far &amp; vast—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I only write a hurried line to let you know my whereabouts—Shall (probably) be returning
      to Camden latter part of next week—Love to all—
   </p>
