      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think you would like to see Robert Sharland's letter so I enclose it. I have just got Bucke's 'Moral Nature'—at least Mrs. Gilchrist lent me a copy some time ago, but I have bought two copies now. It is very interesting,
      I think—it seems to explain to me the relation of animals to man,—the smallness of their <u>brains</u> does not really constitute a gap—even physiologically....I was going to ask you a
      question about the <u>soul</u>, but the more I think about it the less can I make out what it was I was going to
      ask! It was something about whether the sympathetic comes <u>next</u> to it, or whether it is inside it or outside it, or behind it or before it: or what?
      or is it 
      It?—but I fear such conversation is unprofitable.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is so jolly living in this farmyard. Our landlord is a farmer and our little cottage
      is only divided from it by a low wall over which the cows come &amp; put their noses,
      and there are the fowls and a pig and an old horse, and cats &amp; ducks &amp; things. The
      other side of the yard is an orchard, cherry apple &amp; pear, with the farm house. We
      are high here, I daresay 800 ft above the
      
      
      sea, and the land is clayey &amp; cold—the farmers mostly a slow going shrewd sort—saving
      more out of their land than putting into it; the country all the same breaks away
      into beautiful valleys &amp; the wild moors are close at hand—Charles Fox our landlord
      is very friendly. He is about 35, unmarried, a great reader (or has been so), but
      so quiet, homely, clodhopping like that few people suspect him
      
      of it. He is very anxious to travel but a good deal tied down at present. The farm,
      about 30 acres, belongs to him; and I suppose he represents a class of small proprietors,
      farmers, that used to be common in these parts, but there are not so many now. Everything
      is <u>rented</u> now in this country.
   </p>
   
   
   <p><u>Our</u> household consists of Albert Fearnehough, his wife, and Annie a bright girl of 13. There is also a boy George who is apprenticed
      to a joiner in Sheffield. He
      
      comes home only on Saturdays &amp; Sundays: and is always welcome. Now my lectures are
      over I am spending the summer helping in the garden and any odd jobs about the place—and
      am doing also a good deal of writing. I pretty well live out in the open air &amp; don't
      feel as if I shd ever manage indoor life again. It is possible that Albert &amp; I might take a small
      farm, but we shall see. I feel that I <u>must</u>
      
      
      write, at present.—I can't keep my fingers off it—but still that takes only a small
      fraction of the week &amp; leaves plenty of time for other work.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>These friends that I have here and my more natural open air life seem to have made
      a difference to me. I feel as if I had touched the bottom at last, and had something
      firm to go upon—after floundering about so long. Thanks for all that also to you.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I hear that Herbert Gilchrist is painting a portrait of you for Dr Bucke. Is it for the book? Dr B. asked me for
      some contribution—but I have never sent anything—I dont exactly know why, but chiefly because I wasn't sure how the Gilchrists wd like their names appearing so freely in what I had written.
   </p>
