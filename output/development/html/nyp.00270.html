      <br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Would these pieces—or either of them—be available for the Magazine? The price
      is $50—(40 for the first—10 for the other.) I have had them put in type for
      correctness &amp; my private use.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00270_n1">1. Josiah Gilbert Holland (1819–1881),
      mentioned pseudonymously as Timothy Titcomb in Whitman's  letter to William D. O'Connor, was an editor of
      the Springfield <em>Republican</em> from 1850 to 1862, and author
      of <em>Titcomb's Letters to Young People, Simple and Married</em>
      (New York: C. Scribner, 1858). While he was editor of <em>Scribner's Monthly</em> (1870–1881), Whitman submitted poems to him.
      At this time Holland was also editor of the <em>Century
         Magazine</em>. On two occasions Whitman recalled that he had sent poems to
      Holland at the suggestion of John Swinton (Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1996], <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.53.html">1:184</a>; <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.50.html">4:326–327</a>). This letter was probably written in 1875, since one
      of the poems was "Eidólons," which appeared in the New York <em>Tribune</em> on . The following year, Holland issued a hostile criticism in the
      May 1876 issue of <em>Scribner's Monthly</em>, 12 (1876),
      123–125. Holland's lengthy (lost) reply "was offensive, low, bitter,
      inexcusable" (Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.48.html">3:327</a>). In an interview in 1879, Whitman complained that many
      American magazines were "in the hands of old fogies like Holland or fops like
      Howells" (<em>American Literature</em>, 14 [1942–43],
      145–146).<a href="#r1">[back]
