      <br></br><br></br>Mr Walt Whitman
      <br></br>Camden N.J.
      <br></br>My Dear Mr Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>It seems to be but yesterday that I saw you riding on the cars talking to the driver
      on Stevens Street, &amp; it has really been nearly three years three years, this
      coming August since I left Camden. Time has flown so rapidly that it seems but a
      year &amp; yet, again, it seems ten years, since I felt the old home 
   </p>
   
   <p>Your photograph greets me every time I go into my brother's office I have it hung
      there so we can both see it, &amp; you do not know how many people know you way out,
      in this western country.
   </p>
   
   <p>One of my friends came in the other day &amp; said, "you have still got his picture
      hung up," &amp; I said "yes! it would hang there until I go away &amp; then it will
      go <u>with me</u>". it reminds me of so many pleasant chats with
      the original.
   </p>
   
   <p>New Mexico, has changed me so My Dear Mr Whitman that you would not recognize me. I
      am only one inch short of six feet &amp; am heavily built in proportion, weighing
      150 lbs.
   </p>
   
   <p>The first year I came out I was a cowboy, &amp; altho' it is a very prosaic life,
      still I have some very pleasant reminiscences of that time. I have been out on the
      prairie with no house or food in sight when night came &amp; had nothing to do but
      to roll up in my blankets &amp; make the best of it, then again, horse breaking is
      one of the hardest times of the cowboys life. Many a tumble I have had off of a broncho but
      you have to get up &amp; conquer the horse before you stop in spite of all the hard
      knocks you get.
   </p>
   
   <p>For a man with <u>money</u> there <u>is</u>
      wealth in the cattle business, but for a cowboy—only, a small ranche with a
      smaller number of cattle, to look forward to—after years of hard &amp;
      unceasing labor still a cowboy is always happy, contented &amp; what is the best of
      all—the finest &amp; constant friend, when you call upon him, that a man can
      have.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been to Calafornia I went about the first of April &amp; was gone two weeks. the
      scenery I think was the grandest that I ever saw. It was just magnificent. I thought
      how Mr Whitman would like to see it. At times we would be going through some deep,
      dark cañon &amp; then we would burst forth into the full glory of sun as we
      hastened over a level stretch of praire, then we would slowly slowly be going up a
      steep [
      <span class="unclear">part?</span>]
       of the Rockies, only to come dashing down the other side with all the brakes set,
      hard &amp; objects flying by you like magic. I remember one morning we reached the
      top of the San Fransica Mts. just as the sun was rising &amp; it was grand to feel
      the sun &amp; look down the valley when all was as yet in complete darkness with the
      sun slowly ascending &amp; giving its light to the earth below. One place I remember
      well &amp; that was Cañon Diablo a great rent in the Earth 300 ft deep and 100
      ft wide looking
      down that fearful hole your imagination will conjure up ideas that you would not
      think of elsewhere &amp; you can realize the freaks of nature to their fullest extent
      But I have
      not described the town of Albuquerque &amp; I will not attempt to do so, as I can
      never describe anything correctly, but will send you a magazine that I have sent for
      which describes it fully The inhabitants are in expectations of a boom which they
      say will take place in about three months, but as I am not a sanguine person I do
      not say so. I must close now as it is bedtime Mother &amp; Harry say "Remember us to
      Mr Whitman &amp; tell him that we often remember him &amp; wish we could see
      him"
   </p>
   
   <p>If you ever feel like it Mr Whitman a small letter from you would be very much
      appreciated &amp; promptly answered
   </p>

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John W. ("Johnny") Wroth was
      the younger son of Mrs. Caroline Wroth, who was the wife of a Philadelphia
      importer, at whose residence (319 Stevens Street, Camden) Whitman took his meals
      for a period of time beginning in July 1881. Johnny moved with his mother and
      his brother James Henry ("Harry") Wroth to Albuquerque, New Mexico, soon after,
      and Whitman kept in touch with them.
