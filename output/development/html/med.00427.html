      <br></br><br></br>My dear Rossetti,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The bearer of this note is Col. Richard J. Hinton, of this city (though English by
      birth), 
      a friend of mine, who calls to make your acquaintance.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Truly yours,
      <br></br>Walt Whitman.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I have been very ill, from paralysis, but am recovering.</p>
   
   
   <p>Your books (two sets) reached me safely, and gave me great pleasure. I am perfectly
      satisfied 
      with the selections from my poems—and feel grateful to you for your kindness to me
      throughout 
      the books. I do not forget you. I will write again when I feel well. My address remains
      the same—Solicitor's Office, Treasury, here.
   </p>

      Endorsed: "Whitman here speaks of two sets of books that I had sent him.
      These must have been my Selections of <em>American Poems</em>
      in the series <em>Moxon's Popular Poems</em>. W.M.R."<br><br>
      Transcript. Transcription supplied to Edwin Haviland Miller by Professor
      Roger Asselineau, who received it from Gilette Bornand. Bornand made a copy
      of the letter years ago when it was in the possession of William Michael
      Rossetti's daughter. <em>American Poems</em> was apparently
      published early in 1873.<a href="#r1">[back]
