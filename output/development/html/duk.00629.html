   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00629_n4">1. This letter dates to between
      April 21 and May 3, 1873. Richard Maurice Bucke dated this letter only to spring
      1873, and it is not clear whether Edwin Haviland Miller assigned it a date (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:370). The letter indicates that Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman wrote on a Monday, and it dates to late April or to early May
      1873. The earliest possible date, though unlikely, is after April 13, 1873
      (Sunday), the day on which news of the so-called "Modoc Massacre," the
      assassination of General Edward R. S. Canby and Reverend Eleazer Thomas, was
      published in the <em>New York Herald</em>. Louisa refers to having
      learned of those events "last" Sunday from the <em>Herald</em>.
      Her phrase may mean either the most recent Sunday (April 13) or the one
      following, so the letter could also date after April 21, 1873 (Monday). However,
      another phrase, if in echo of an extant letter from Walt Whitman, could date the
      letter even later. Louisa wrote, "you dident write how you was particularly that
      you was abou[t?] the same." The phrase, a familiar refrain in both Walt's and
      Louisa's letters, echoes Walt's 
      letter: "I am about the same." In sum, Louisa's letter is near certain to date
      to no earlier than April 21, the Monday a week after news of the Modoc Massacre
      was first reported on April 13, 1873. However, Louisa's phrase "abou[t?] the
      same"—unless in echo of a non-extant earlier letter—is likely to
      follow Walt's April 30, 1873 letter. As both a non-extant letter from Walt with
      a familiar phrase and confusion about how many Sundays have passed since a
      widely covered story was first reported are quite possible, the letter is
      assigned a range from April 21 to May 3, 1873.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00629_n5">2. Walt Whitman after his
      paralytic stroke in late January 1873 promised his mother to provide regular
      updates about his condition. This remark appears to echo Walt's  letter to Louisa, "I am about the
      same."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00629_n7">3. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward had shared the Brooklyn
      residence with Jeff and Mattie's family until Jeff departed for St. Louis.
      Mattie died on February 19, 1873 (see Jeff's February 24, 1873 letter to Louisa
      in Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother
         Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State
      University Press, 1984], 158). The letters after Mattie's death show that
      emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa. For more on Mattie,
      see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha
         Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      1–26.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00629_n3">4. George Washington Whitman
      was building a house on a corner lot at 431 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey (see Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975], 31). For an extended description of George's planned house, see
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's 
      letter to Walt Whitman.<br><br>
      George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until
      the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of
      Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of
      Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn
      and began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and
      later a mason named French. George also took a position as inspector of
      pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam in spring
      1871. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward moved from Brooklyn to reside
      with them in Camden in August 1872. For more information on George, see
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00629_n6">5. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Louisa Orr in April 1873 was believed
      pregnant, and she began to spend entire days upstairs without descending (see
      Louis Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to
      Walt). Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman was displeased with the
      living arrangement and confided many frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her
      letters to Walt. She never developed the close companionship with Lou that she
      had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00628_n15">6. The "aunt" who was engaged
      to assist Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, George Washington Whitman's wife, has not
      been identified but is probably named Elizabeth. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      described her daughter-in-law Louisa Orr's aunt as English and was not fond of
      the aunt's company. She is named "aunt Lib" and "aunt Libby" in Louisa's  and  letters to Walt.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00629_n1">7. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor (1830–1913), who, with
      Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates
      during the Washington years. Before marrying William O'Connor, Ellen Tarr was
      active in the antislavery movement as a contributor to the <em>Liberator</em> and in the women's rights movements as a contributor to <em>Una</em>. Nelly had a close personal relationship with
      Whitman, and correspondence between Whitman and Nelly is almost as voluminous as
      the poet's correspondence with William. Nelly also helped nurse Whitman after
      his paralytic stroke in January 1873. For more on Whitman's relationship with
      the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00613_n1">8. Walt befriended Peter Doyle
      (1843–1907), a horsecar conductor in Washington, around 1865. Though
      Whitman informed Doyle of his flirtations with women in their correspondence,
      Martin G. Murray affirms that "Whitman and Doyle were 'lovers' in the
      contemporary sense of the word." Doyle assisted in caring for Whitman after his
      stroke in January 1873. See Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00155.html">"Pete the Great: A Biography of Peter Doyle."</a><a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00629_n8">9. In the view of newspapers of
      the day, the "Modoc Massacre" was the unprovoked assassination of General Edward
      R. S. Canby and Reverend Eleazer Thomas and the wounding of Oregon Indian
      Superintendent Alfred Meacham during negotiation between the United States Army
      and the Modoc tribe led by Kientpoos (?–1873), known as "Captain Jack."
      Canby sought the return of the Modoc people to a reservation occupied by the
      Klamath people, an historical enemy of the Modocs. Protected in their stronghold
      of the Lava Beds, Kientpoos and his fellow Modocs sought to remain near Lost
      River. Canby and Thomas, part of a Peace Commission that Ulysses S. Grant formed
      in an effort to end the standoff, went to the peace negotiation with the Modocs
      unarmed. They were killed on April 11, 1873. For the initial report that Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman cites, see "Massacre," <em>New York
         Herald</em>, April 13, 1873, 8. Also see Erwin N. Thompson, <em>The Modoc War: Its Military History and Topography</em> (Sacramento: Argus
      Books, 1971).<a href="#r9">[back]
