   </p> 
   
   <p>I was glad to hear by your postal that you are getting along without an increase of
      suffering. I wish that we all were near you, if so be that we might make an
      occasional hour brighter for you &amp; contribute to your exterior comforts. I see no
      time to be fixed for our return. Alys<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> proposes to go to
      Bryn Mawr College in September &amp; then will visit you. She will return to us if all
      is well in June 1890 with her diploma in her pocket.
   </p>
   
   <p>She, with her mother,<sup><a href="#n6170" id="r2">2</a></sup> a niece &amp; myself have been
      wandering this
      winter through Paris, Marseilles, the paradise of Nice and the Riviera, Rome,
      Florence, Venice, Milan, Switzerland &amp; home escaping thus
      the melancholy skies of London with its "pea soup" smoky
      atmosphere.
   </p> 
   
   <p>Logan<sup><a href="#loc.03841_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> is doing well at his college at Oxford &amp; is
      studying faithfully in his vacation at home.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mary's second daughter,<sup><a href="#loc.01354_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> 3 weeks old, opens new hopes &amp;
      joys—but through much suffering. Her husband<sup><a href="#n6114" id="r5">5</a></sup> is in the
      new London City Council and is becoming prominent in abilities &amp; in his profession
      as a barrister.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My old enemy "melancholia" spreads its vampire wings still over my life and will I
      presume go with me to the end. I take it quietly, as a physical disease simply &amp;
      live on remembering the phrase—"Its dogged that does it."
   </p>
   
   <p>So I have not much to tell. Yet it is fun to be in the midst of this great fermenting
      intense life of London as an on looker.
   </p>
   
   <p>I see with interest that you have issued a complete edition<sup><a href="#n4195" id="r6">6</a></sup> of your writings. You
      have many, many devoted friends in England among thoughtful people who would delight
      to see you here.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good bye, dear old friend,—Write me when your spirit moves you &amp; tell me how
      you are.
   </p>
   
   <p>With love from our children I am always</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
