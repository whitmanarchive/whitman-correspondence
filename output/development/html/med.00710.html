   </p>
   
   <p>I have yours of 31st ult.<sup><a href="#med.00710_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Have written Forman as you suggest and have also written McKay (send you enclosed a copy of the letter that you may see
      plainly on what footing you are with him). If the book
      is published in London <u>before</u> it is pubd in America I
      believe the copyright will be as safe as the bank of
      England. Archie Bremner<sup><a href="#med.00710_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> is
      still here on the staff of "Advertiser"—The notice in the "Press"<sup><a href="#med.00710_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> was very gratifying, hope you will send me any you can
      <u>particularly the adverse ones</u>—You do not say anything about sending copies as I asked you in
      my last, I take it for granted 
      
      meantime that you will attend to this—and also
      that you will have balance of my ten copies sent me here soon as
      convenient—The weather here now is perfect and the grounds look better than I
      have ever seen them We are all well and send you love

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
