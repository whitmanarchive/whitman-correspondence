      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I thought I would write you a letter to-day, as you would be anxious to hear. I rec'd
      your letter of Aug. 24, &amp; it was a great comfort to me. I have read it several
      times since—Dear Pete, I hope every thing is going on favorably with you. I
      think about you every day &amp; every night. I do hope you are in good spirits &amp;
      health. I want to hear about the face.<sup><a href="#loc.01520_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I
      suppose you are working on the road.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing new or special in my affairs or doings. The weather is pleasant
      here—it is pretty cool &amp; dry. My folks all continue well—mother
      first rate, &amp; brothers ditto. I do not have such good luck. I have felt unwell
      most every day—some days not so bad. Besides I have those spells again, worse,
      last longer, sick enough, come sudden, dizzy, &amp; sudden sweat—It is hard to
      tell exactly what is the matter, or what to do. The doctor says it is all from that
      hospital malaria, hospital poison absorbed in the system years ago—he thinks
      it better for me in Washington than here. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>About one third of the time I feel pretty well. I have taken three or four of my
      favorite rides on Broadway. I believe I described them to you in my letters a year
      ago. I find many of my old friends, &amp; new ones too, &amp; am received with the
      same warm friendship &amp; love as ever. Broadway is more crowded &amp; gay than
      ever, &amp; the women look finer, &amp; the shops richer—then there are many
      new &amp; splendid buildings, of marble or iron—they seem to almost reach the
      clouds, they are so tall—some of them cost millions of dollars. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Staging in N. Y. has been very poor this summer—9 or $10, even on the big
      Broadway lines—Railroading has also been slim. New York is all cut up with
      railroads—Brooklyn also—I have seen Jimmy Foy<sup><a href="#loc.01520_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—he was over to Brooklyn, looking for work on a road. He was well &amp;
      hearty, &amp; wished to be remembered to you. They pay $2½ on many of the
      roads here, &amp; 2¼ on the rest. The work is pretty hard, but the hours not so
      long as in Washington.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is all kinds of fun &amp; sport here, by day &amp; night—&amp; lots of
      theatres &amp; amusements in full blast. I have not been to any of them—have
      not been to see any of my particular women friends—though sent for, (the
      papers here have noticed my arrival)—have not been down to the sea-shore as I
      intended—In fact my jaunt this time has been a failure—Better luck next
      time—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now Pete, dear, loving boy, I don't want you to worry about me—I shall come
      along all right. As it is, I have a good square appetite most of the time yet, good
      nights' sleep—&amp; look about the same as usual, (which is, of course,
      lovely &amp; fascinating beyond description.) Tell Johnny Lee<sup><a href="#loc.01520_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I send him my love,
      &amp; hope he is well &amp; hearty. I think of him daily. I sent him a letter some
      time ago, which I suppose he rec'd about Aug. 26, &amp; showed you<sup><a href="#loc.01520_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>—but I
      have not had a word from him. Lend him this letter to read, as he will wish to hear
      about me. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>God bless you, dear Pete, dear loving comrade, &amp; Farewell till next time, my
      darling boy.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
