   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07302_n6">2. Frederick Gutekunst (1831–1917) was a well-known ninteenth-century American photographer
      in Philadelphia. During the Civil War he made portraits of soldiers, and, after the
      War, he continued to create high quality
      portraits of notable figures, including Abraham Lincoln, Lucretia Mott, and Grover
      Cleveland. He made portraits of Whitman
      in Philadelphia ca. 1879–1881 and in 1889, which are available in <em>The Walt Whitman's Archive</em>'s Gallery of Images.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.01388_n2">3. Whitman recorded his visit
      to Frederick Gutekunst's Philadelphia studio in his daybook on August 6, not the
