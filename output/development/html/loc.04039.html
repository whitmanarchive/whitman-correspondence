   <p id="loc.04039_n1">1. "Broadway Revisited"
      appeared in the New York <em>Tribune</em> on May 10, and,
      rearranged, in <em>Specimen Days</em> (ed. Floyd Stovall [New
      York: New York University Press, 1963], 16–21, 338–339). This was
      the first of three chatty (and, in the view of Edwin Haviland Miller,
      embarrassingly trite) letters Whitman submitted to the <em>Tribune</em> in May (<em>Walt Whitman: The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77]
      3:153 n39). See also the letter from Whitman to Whitelaw Reid of . On May 29 Whitman received from D.
      Nicholson $45 for the three articles.<a href="#r1">[back]
