      <br></br><br></br>Dear William O'Connor
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I like the big letter of May 25 the more I have read it—I think it will never
      die—I am glad the Rev Mr Chadwick<sup><a href="#nyp.00443_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> appears with his
      <em>Tribune</em> letter to you to-day (as enclosed) for the fine
      chance it affords to ventilate the real account &amp; true inwardness of that
      Emerson talk on the Common in 1860—&amp; I at once send you the best synopsis
      of it I can recall—quite certainly the same in amount as I told you while it
      was fresh in my memory—the which with hasty scribblings on my relations with
      Emerson—I hope (working in as from yourself) you will incorporate in your
      answer to Tribune—
   </p>

      <br></br>Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>for head</p>
   
   <p>? <em>What were 
         Emersons
         
          relations to Walt Whitman?</em></p>
   
   <p>(for quoting entire in your letter if you think proper)</p>
   
   <p>"What made, and ever makes the argument of Emerson, in that walk on the Common,
      so dear and <em>holy to me, was the personal affectionateness</em>
      of it, as of an elderly brother to a younger. It was a vehement, even passionate
      well-wishing, which I felt then and feel to this hour the gratitude and
      reverence of my life could never repay. Although perfect from an intellectual
      and conventional point of view, it did not advance any thing I had not already
      considered. And my arriere and citadel positions—such as I have indicated
      in my June <em>North American Review</em> memorandum<sup><a href="#nyp.00443_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—were not only not attacked, they were not even
      alluded to.
   </p>
   
   <p>While I am on the subject, let me tell you I am sure the same process went on
      with Emerson, in this particular (it was not needed any where else) that goes on
      with many other of my readers. Certain am I that he too finally came to clearly
      feel that the "Children of Adam" pieces were inevitable and consistent—and
      in that sense, at least, proper—parts of the book. He was not the man to
      retract any utterance: whatever it had been, it had expressed the truth of the
      period.
   </p>
   
   <p>That he said some transient things, from 1863 to 1873, which are in the critical
      direction and are acrid, (very likely your discussion will bring them out) there
      is no doubt. But he permanently loved me, and believed in my poems, of which the
      "Children of Adam" section, though difficult to unfold, is vertebral."
   </p>
   
   <p>William, I submit to you whether it 
      wouldnt
      
       be well, in your reply to <em>quote all this</em>, as extracted from a late letter to you
      from me<sup><a href="#nyp.00443_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—

   <p id="nyp.00443_n2">2. John White Chadwick
      (1840–1904), who termed himself a radical Unitarian, was the pastor of the
      Second Unitarian Church in Brooklyn from 1865 until his death. He was also a
      reviewer for <em>The Nation</em> and the author of <em>A Book of Poems</em> (1876). In his reply to O'Connor in the
      <em>Tribune</em> of May 28, Chadwick averred that Emerson had
      qualified his earlier praise of the poet. On  O'Connor wrote to Whitman: "Of course I shall answer this clerical
      blackguard, who has the audacity to accuse me of wilfully and consciously lying,
      and I shall do my best to answer him with blasting effect" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell
      Kennerley, 1914], 3:283).<a href="#r2">[back]
