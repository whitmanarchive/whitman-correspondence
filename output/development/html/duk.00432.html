   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00432_n14">1. 
      This letter dates to December 16 or December 17, 1863. Richard Maurice Bucke
      dated this letter to mid-December on an accompanying slip of paper held in
      the Trent Collection (not reproduced here). Edwin Haviland Miller estimated
      December 15?, 1863, a Tuesday (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:189, n. 75).Based on inferences from contextual clues in
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters from sons George Washington Whitman,
      Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, and Walt during the same week, this letter
      should be assigned to Wednesday or Thursday, not the Tuesday proposed by
      Miller.<br><br>
      This letter is the second that Louisa wrote to Walt following Andrew Jackson
      Whitman's death on December 3. In it, she reports receiving two letters on
      the day she is writing, one from Walt and one from his brother George.
      Because she quotes almost verbatim from George's letter in her own letter,
      she had received his  letter
      from Camp Pittman in Kentucky. Given typical mail times, Walt's  letter to Louisa (from
      Washington, D.C.) arrived in Brooklyn on the same day as George's December 9
      letter.<br><br>
      Jeff's letter on Jesse Whitman's disturbing outburst after Andrew Whitman's
      death provides further corroborating detail. According to Louisa, Jeff
      departed for Springfield, Massachusetts on Monday "this week," and he was
      expected back before the end of the week. Jeff informed Walt that he arrived
      back at Springfield "on Monday—yesterday" (see Jeff's  letter to Walt). Jeff's date
      and Louisa's date for Jeff's departure for Springfield are identical. Jeff
      in his letter described Jesse's outburst toward his wife and daughter
      Manahatta just after Andrew's death. Because Louisa does not mention Jesse's
      outburst at all, she was responding to Walt's December 15, 1863 letter, in
      which he sought more details about Andrew's funeral. Louisa did not know
      that Walt would soon receive the harrowing account of Jesse's outburst in
      Jeff's letter: Louisa had downplayed the seriousness of Jesse's threats
      toward Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman and daughter Manahatta
      in her  letter to
      Walt. That this letter dates within a week or two of Andrew's December 1863
      death is indisputable. Since Louisa has received Walt's December 15 letter
      on the day she wrote this letter, since George's letter probably arrived on
      the same day, and since her date for Jeff's departure is consistent with
      Jeff's December 15 letter from Springfield, this letter dates either to
      December 16 (Wednesday) or December 17, 1863.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00467_n1">2. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">4. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00432_n13">5. Springfield, Massachusetts
      is located on the Connecticut River, north of Hartford, Connecticut,
      approximately one hundred miles west of Boston. During the Civil War, it was the
      site of the United States Arsenal, the largest manufacturer of military
      firearms. According to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman, Jeff was in Springfield to
      prepare surveys for William Ezra Worthen.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00432_n5">6. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      eldest son Andrew Jackson Whitman (1827–1863) died December 3, 1863 (see
      her  letter to Walt
      Whitman). During Andrew's lifetime, he and his wife Nancy McClure Whitman had
      two sons James "Jimmy" and George "Georgy," and Nancy was pregnant with a son,
      Andrew, Jr., when Andrew died. In the early 1860s, Andrew had worked as a
      carpenter, and he enlisted briefly in the Union Army during the Civil War (see
      Martin G. Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00432_n6">7. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      suggestion that Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873), Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's wife, went to bed early because she was burdened by
      loneliness at her husband's absence and also by grief for Andrew Jackson
      Whitman's death is notable for an omission. Mattie locked herself and her
      children in a section of the house away from Jesse Whitman. After Jeff described
      Jesse's outburst toward his wife Mattie and daughter Manahatta, Jeff wrote that
      he and Mattie "dont allow Jess to come in our rooms" (see Jeff's  letter to Walt). Also see
      Mattie's December 21, 1863 letter to Walt for another account of Jesse's
      behavior (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of
         Martha Mitchell Whitman</em>[New York: New York University Press, 1971],

   <p id="duk.00432_n15">8. See George Washington
      Whitman's  letter from Camp
      Pittman in Kentucky. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman quotes almost verbatim from
      George's letter. The account of Andrew Whitman's funeral that follows the news
      from George was in response to Walt's request for "the particulars of Andrew's
      funeral" (see Walt's  letter to
      Louisa).<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="duk.00423_n8">10. Cornell is James H.
      Cornwell, a friend of Andrew Whitman, who got him a job in North Carolina in
      1863 building fortifications. Cornwell served as a judge in the Brooklyn City
      Hall and is listed as a lawyer in the 1870 census, which also identifies his
      wife as Mary (b. 1822?) (<em>United States Census, 1870</em>,
      Brooklyn, Kings, New York). He is mentioned in Whitman's "Scenes in a Police
      Justices' Court Room" (<em>Brooklyn Daily Times</em>, September 9,
      1857). For more on the relationship between Andrew Jackson Whitman and Cornwell,

      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George

      closing parenthesis mark, which Louisa Van Velsor Whitman used to close phrases,
      that has been canceled by a strikethrough mark. However, the mark used to strike
      through the parenthesis faintly resembles a word, possibly "[a]nd[?]." The marks
      (and the possible word) are omitted from the text transcribed here, since the
      canceled parenthesis mark is the more likely reading.<a href="#r14">[back]

   <p id="duk.00432_n19">15. The <em>Brooklyn Directory</em> (1863) lists a Francis B. Stryker (b. 1846) at 188
      Adams Street with the profession inspector. His occupation in the 1880 census is
      listed as Officer in City Court, which would be consistent with an acquaintance
      with Andrew Whitman's friend James H. Cornwell, though the Stryker listed in the
      directory and the census would be almost two decades younger than Andrew (see
      <em>United States Census, 1880</em>. Brooklyn, Kings, New
      York). Another Francis Stryker (b. 1811) is also listed as a superintendent (<em>United States Census, 1870</em>, Brooklyn Ward 4, Kings, New

   <p id="duk.00430_n5">16. The Brown family began
      boarding in the same house as the Whitmans on Portland Avenue, Brooklyn in April
      1860. The relationship between the Browns and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's
      family was often strained, but the Browns remained in the Portland Avenue house
      for five years. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman maintained a cordial relationship with
      the Browns after Jeff and his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman departed for
      St. Louis. Years later Louisa called on Mrs. Brown and remarked to Walt Whitman,
      "if Jeff and matt knew i had been to see mrs Brown they would cross me off their
      books" (see her  letter).<a href="#r16">[back]
