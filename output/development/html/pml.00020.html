      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy &amp; comrade,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#pml.00020_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is a long while since I have written to you—I believe it is six months, or over—but
      you must not think I have forgotten you—I have thought of you often, &amp; wished we could
      be together.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Al, I believe the last letter I got from you was last April.<sup><a href="#pml.00020_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I went home about that time to Brooklyn, N. Y., 
      &amp; remained home quite a long time—one of my brothers, (who had been a soldier &amp; all
      through the war, 
      in the 9th Corps,) was sick with erysipelas, &amp; lay very low for a while—but has recovered.
      My Mother, &amp; the rest of the folks, are all well. I have had good health since 
      I last wrote to you. I am still working in the Attorney General's Office, here—I am
      writing this letter at my desk in the office, seated by the same old open window,
      where I can look out 
      &amp; have a splendid view of the Potomac river, &amp; the hills &amp; trees &amp; banks, for miles
      &amp; miles. 
      It looks pleasant enough—but we are having it very hot indeed, just now—last night
      was very oppressive—then the air is so close &amp; stale in the city in hot weather any
      how—I sometimes feel as I could hardly breathe.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Alfred, I suppose you read in the papers about the trial of John H. Surratt<sup><a href="#pml.00020_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> 
      for taking part in the murder of President Lincoln. I went down to the trial, day
      before yesterday. 
      Surratt is very young—I sat near him &amp; looked at him a long time—he sits most of the
      time fanning himself 
      with a big palm leaf fan, &amp; watches the witnesses with his sharp eyes—&amp; his brother,<sup><a href="#pml.00020_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> a young farmer-looking man 
      from Texas, sits close by him. The lawyers on both sides are very smart—sometimes
      the evidence goes strongly against him, 
      &amp; then again for him. It is very interesting to sit &amp; hear the witnesses &amp; the speeches
      of the lawyers. 
      It has been a tedious trial, &amp; it is hard to tell how it will end.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Al, you mentioned about your father buying a new farm, last spring. You must tell
      me how it goes—&amp; also how you are getting along yourself, for I want to hear every
      thing, &amp; all the particulars about you.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Tell your father &amp; mother I would write to them, but I suppose writing to you is almost
      the same. 
      I send them my love, &amp; a full share to you, dearest comrade. My address is the same
      
      as you directed your former letters. Well, I must draw to a close. Alfred, your love
      for me, 
      &amp; the kind invitations you have sent me, &amp; from the kind father &amp; mother also, to
      come 
      &amp; pay you all a visit, are fully appreciated by me.<sup><a href="#pml.00020_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> I hope &amp; intend to come &amp; see you all, 
      one of these days. Write &amp; let me know if you get this. Farewell, my darling boy,
      
      &amp; God bless you, &amp; bless the dear parents also.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pml.00020_n1">1. All that is known about
      Alfred Pratt is contained in this letter and those of , , , , , , , and .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00020_n2">2. Only two of Pratt's
      letters are extant— and —both of which are held in
      the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00020_n3">3. John H. Surratt, who had
      been a secret dispatch bearer for the Confederacy and involved, with his mother
      Anna, in John Wilkes Booth's conspiracy, fled the country before the murder of
      Abraham Lincoln. He remained a fugitive until he was arrested in Egypt in 1866.
      Unlike his mother, who had been convicted by a military tribunal and ordered
      hanged on July 7, 1865, the son was tried in a civil court, between June 10 and
      August 10, 1867. When the jury could not agree, a new trial was ordered, but
      because of inadequate evidence the government quietly released Surratt on June
      22, 1868. His sister Anna sought clemency for her mother in 1865, but,
      presumably because of a conspiracy, her plea never reached the desk of President
      Andrew Johnson. See David Miller DeWitt, <em>The Assassination of
         Abraham Lincoln</em> (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1909).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="pml.00020_n4">4. Isaac was John Surratt's
      elder brother. His counsels were Joseph H. Bradley and Richard T. Merrick, and
      the government was represented by Edwards Pierrepont; see De Witt, <em>The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln</em> (New York: The
      Macmillan Company, 1909).<a href="#r4">[back]

      such invitation in his  letter to
