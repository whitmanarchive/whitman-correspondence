   <p>Thanks for your letter this morn'g—the "Sands"<sup><a href="#loc.05871_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> is intended (such as it is) for 20
      pp. of "Annex" to follow L of G. consecutively paged—I have duplicate sets of them
      to be properly paged for the pp. for the "Annex"—I am probably no worse, but am to
      day certainly no better or strongly—the bowel
      movement is just right (a great favorable point daily or every other daily)—my eye
      sight goes badly—I enclose you Pearsall Smith's note<sup><a href="#loc.05871_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> wh' is favorable &amp; you will
      want to know—the remains cool &amp; pleasant to-day—My sister Lou<sup><a href="#n0368" id="r3">3</a></sup> is here
      to-day. My dinner is just here &amp; I relish it—

   </p>
   
   <p>It was with much regret that we felt compelled to leave you in your sickness last
      week. We hold you in affectionate remembrance as we pass over the waters to England
      where once we hoped to have had your company. We beg that you will send us from  time to time as
      you feel able accounts of your health and of all that nearly concerns you concerns
      us also who love you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Our passage across the whole way has been nearly as smooth as a duck pond, and my
      health has been very much benefitted by it.
   </p>
   
   <p>I bear your messages of love and remembrance to your many friends in  London, who
      without my privileges of personal fellowship with you, honour and love you. I hope
      that the knowledge of this may often cheer and console you in hours of pain and
      weariness. Alys,<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> my faithful secretary, joins me in the
      expression of the hearty affection with which I am always
   </p>

      Your loving friend
      <br></br>R. Pearsall Smith

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05871_n3">1. Whitman is referring to
      "Sands at Seventy," a group of late poems that he had included in <em>November Boughs</em> (1888) and then included as an "annex" to
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> starting with the 1889 printing of
      the book.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0368">3. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
