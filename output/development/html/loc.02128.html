   <p>
      It is with profound
      sorrow that I read in the papers
      the news that you are again 
      suffering from your old trouble.
      I trust it is not so serious as
      reported. My regard for you is 
      so great that I am very sorry, not
      to be able to buy more copies of your
      books and thus give a more substantial
      token of sympathy.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I am an enthusiastic reader of
      your books, both volumes of which
      I have within reach of hand.
      I am, everywhere in my teaching
      and writing, making your claims
      felt and shall continue to do so.
      
      
      
      
      
      I have demonstrated (what of course 
      you know) that there is no veil—no
      impediment—between your mind
      and your audience, when your
      writings are <u>voiced.</u> The formlessness
      is only seeming not real.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I have never read a page
      of your poetry, or quoted a line,
      that has not commanded admiration.
      The music is there and the grandeur
      of thought is there, if the reader
      reads, guided by the sense and
      not by the external lining or paragraphing.
      Even very young pupils
      feel the thrill of the deep rolling
      music though the thought may be too
      profound for them to grasp.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      In a course of lectures before the
      Boston School of Oratory last summer
      I made a test of the matter. I do 
      not think a single pupil held out
      
      
      
      
      against my arguments supplemented
      by readings from your work.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      The trouble is they get at your work
      through the daily press or through the
      defenders of Longfellow or Tennyson (whom
      it is supposed you utterly antagonize).
      When it is brought to them by one 
      who appreciates and measurably understands
      your methods and ideals I 
      do not think there is any doubt
      of the favorable result. I have found
      much opposition but it was mostly
      ignorant &amp; misled.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I am a young man of very ordinary
      attainments and do not presume to
      do more than to give you a glimpse
      of the temper of that public which 
      would not do you wrong, deliberately,
      but who by reason of the causes
      hinted at above, fail to get at the
      transcendent power of "Leaves of Grass."
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      If I have given you the impression
      that I believe in you and strive
      
      
      
      
      to interpret you, you will not 
      feel that I have over-stepped the
      privileges of a pupil in the presence of a great teacher.
      
   </p>
   
   <p> 
      The enclosed slip is a meagre
      out-line of a volume which I am
      writing and which I hope to get out this
      coming spring. As the motto-page
      of this volume I have used a paragraph
      from your "Collect" which
      is entitled "Foundation Stayed—then 
      Others." While it is not strictly
      essential to the book, yet I should
      esteem it a favor if you 
      consent to its use. One sentence,
      <u>"In nothing is there more evolution
         than in the American mind</u>," 
      I have also used in company 
      with Spencer's great law of progress
      upon my title page. It helped
      to decide the title, which is: <u>The Evolution
         of American Thought</u>:<sup><a href="#loc.02128_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> an outline
      study of the leading phases of American
      Literature etc. In the latter part
      
      
      
      
      of the volume I have treated of
      the Age of Democracy and its thought,
      taking as foundation the splendid
      utterances of Mr. Paine upon the modern
      age. It is in this chapter that
      I place your work. I quote from
      you quite largely both in treating
      of your writings and in treating
      the general theme of present and
      future democratic ideals. I hope
      to be able to please you with my
      treatment of your great work.
      Beside this I am preparing special
      lectures upon the same subject.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Have you any objection to the
      quotations which I find if necessary
      to use? In conclusion let me 
      say that without any bias in your
      favor, (rather the opposite from newspapers)
      your poems thrilled me, reversed many
      of my ideas, confirmed me in others,
      helped to make me what I am. I 
      am a border-man; born in Wisconsin
      
      
      
      
      and raised on the prairie &amp;
      frontier. I am a disciple of Mr. Spencer
      and therefore strive at comparative methods
      of criticism. That your poems should
      thus convert me, is to me a revelation
      of their power, especially when I can
      convince others in the same manner.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      And my revered friend (for I feel
      you are a friend) think of me as one
      who radiates the principles of the modern
      age, and who will in his best manner
      (poor at best) strive to make his hearers
      and readers better aware of the
      goodness and grandeur of the "Good 
      Gray Poet" and his elemental lines.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Your readers are increasing, and
      may you live to see the circle
      infinitely extended, is my fervent hope.
      I do not expect a reply to this other
      than the signification whether I may
      quote you or not. I wish I might
      see and talk with you but that is not
      possible except through your volumes.
