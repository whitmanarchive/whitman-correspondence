   </p>
   
   <p>I received your latest letter—I was glad indeed to hear from you—yet exceeding sorry
      to hear from Walt that he was feeling so badly—I hope beyond all things that he is
      now feeling better<sup><a href="#loc.00470_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The children are quite well and apparently quite happy—they speak of you often—and
      talk only of you and their mamma
   </p>
   
   <p>You ask a question in regard to the silence of all our letters in regard to Mrs O'Rielly.<sup><a href="#loc.00470_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> in regard to this I must say to you that though I cannot tell you in a letter in
      regard to why the letters are silent in regard to her I can and will explain the matter
      to you when I see you which I sincerely hope will be before long—I do not know how
      soon—yet as we have made a contract with some Hartford people for a new Engine<sup><a href="#loc.00470_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I hope I may be sent East early in the summer—Of one thing I can assure you no one
      on earth loved Mattie better than she except our own family and though denied—to the
      public her company yet they did meet and were happy—I wrote you very fully in regard to Matties death—much
      I could write you about her later life—abt all she talked about was Walt and yourself—she had a great desire to see you—and
      I am sorry—very sorry—that you could not have met—but fate cannot be helped
   </p>
   
   <p>I am feeling pretty well &nbsp;Have been away from the city [a] great deal of the time
      lately—am employed to make a design for water works at Kansas city, and have been
      up there a good deal lately<sup><a href="#loc.00470_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—shall write you again soon &nbsp;Love to George and Loo—and all send love to you

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00470_n1">1. In his letters to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman of March 1873, Walt Whitman stressed that he was
      slowly, gradually regaining his health. Nonetheless, he acknowledged on March 13
      that "the principal trouble is yet in the head, &amp; so easily getting
      fatigued—my whole body feels heavy, &amp; sometimes my hand" (Edwin Haviland
      Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961-77], 2:205-06).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00470_n2">2. Unfortunately Mrs.
      O'Reilly remains a mysterious figure. Jeff is obviously flustered in writing
      about her—he repeats "in regard" five times in two sentences—and he clearly
      intends to hide something. This woman may have been married to the O'Reilly
      conected with Henry J. D'Arcy (see ), but this is
      conjecture. See .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00470_n3">3. The Hartford Foundry
      and Machine Company of Hartford, Connecticut, provided the third pumping engine
      for the waterworks.<a href="#r3">[back]
