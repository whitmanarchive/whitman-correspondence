      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have your card of 6<u>th</u><sup><a href="#loc.05147_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> and we shall count on your coming here early in Dec. to
      spend the winter with us—the next question is shall I go to Philadelphia for
      you or meet you at the Falls? You can get a train by which you can run through to
      the Falls without change so that there would not be any difficulty in coming that
      far alone if you were feeling pretty well (I must caution you however about talking
      too long to those goodlooking girls at Homersville as you might get left). But would
      it not
      be as well (or necessary) for me to go to Philadelphia to arrange for the
      publication of my book<sup><a href="#loc.05147_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> in the Spring? Or can you arrange this without me? And if I
      do not go myself will it not be necessary to send the M.S. with copies of the
      illustrations?
      Let me know at your earliest convenience what you think of all this: We are all well
      and Mrs. B., as well as myself, is much pleased at the prospect of seeing you so soon—don't
      disappoint us.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05147_n1">1. Whitman's postcard to
      Bucke appears to be lost. If Whitman intended to visit Bucke in the winter of
      1882, he made no mention of it in any of his extant letters.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05147_n2">2. Bucke is likely talking
      about his 1883 biography <em>Walt Whitman</em> here—a book
      for which Whitman wrote long passages himself and heavily revised others.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
