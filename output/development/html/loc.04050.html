      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your postcard came to hand some little time ago.<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r1">1</a></sup> I was pleased to get it, to hear of your being well, &amp; with your friends. I have
      been extremely busy seeing after the new edition of my father's book;<sup><a href="#loc.04050_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> the work of seeing such a richly illustrated "edition de luxe" through the press
      was enormous, but it is done! The binders are now doing their work, &amp; next Tuesday
      the reviewers will be doing theirs—I defy them to find any fault with the book. I
      dare say you think it "tall" talk, but I think that it is the most perfectly gotten
      up book that I ever have seen. My mother has written an admirable memoir of my father
      at the end of the second vol.

   <p>I thought that this was to be the title of your prose volume. I will undertake the
      illustrations, choosing the paper (hand made), everything except the expense of reproducing,
      etc. I should say London is the place to have things executed in: if you wish to give
      photos they must be drawn by an artist and reproduced; no photo ever looked well in
      a book yet! they haven't decorative importance and don't blend with type. I should
      suggest that we should imitate the artistic size &amp; style of your earliest edition
      of "Leaves of G.," a large, thin, flat volume, a fanciful, but as inexpensive as possible,
      cover written in gold on blue, a waterlily say: but I could think this over. I will
      design fanciful tailpieces to be woven in with the text; as a frontispiece the drawing
      that I gave you, retouched by me, and reproduced by the Typographic Etching Company,
      23 Farringdon street, London, E. C. All these are only suggestions, which I am prepared
      to execute in right earnest thought. I read your letter to mother with interest. We
      like our new house so much, &amp; I am sure that you would. You must come and stay with
      us &amp; stroll on Hampstead Heath, &amp; ride down into London upon an omnibus &amp; sit to some
      good sculptor here in London (Boem say). And you yourself could make arrangements
      with the publishers. With remembrance to friends,
   </p>
