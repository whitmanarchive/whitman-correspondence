   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00841_n1">1. On April 1, 1865, Whitman
      signed a contract with Eckler to stereotype 500 copies for $254.00: "The
      workmanship is to be first class in every respect &amp; to be completed, &amp;
      the printed sheets delivered within one month from this date" (F. DeWolfe
      Miller, ed., <em>Drum-Taps</em> [Gainesville, FL: Scholars'
      Facsimiles &amp; Reprints, 1959], xxxv). The contract called for "one hundred
      &amp; twenty pages," but since the book contained only 72 pages, Eckler
      submitted on  a bill for $192.85, of which
      $138.00 had been paid. According to Whitman's notations on the statement, he
      paid $20.00 on April 26 and again on .
      Whitman sent this letter in answer to Eckler's request of  that the balance be paid. On , Eckler issued a receipt for $34.85, and
      included a receipt from Coridon A. Alvord, printer, for the stereotype plates,
      which he had placed in his vault. On ,
      Eckler had informed Whitman that the book was "now to press" and would "be ready
      for the Binders next Monday morning." For details on the printing history and
      organization of <em>Drum-Taps</em> see Ted Genoways, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00297.pdf">The
