   </p>
   
   <p>I thought I would write you a word to say that I am perfectly well and hearty</p>
   
   <p>We arrived here last night about dark, and are going to fall in, in a few minutes
      to move on towards Warrenton I believe. I hear that Grant has issued an order, that
      no letters will be allowed to be sent from this army for the next Sixty days. If that
      is the case Walt you must tell Mother not to feel the least bit worried if she does
      not hear from me in some time. I send this by Adjt McKee<sup><a href="#duk.00353_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> who is going to Washington for a day or two
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I can tell you nothing about the army, more than you already know everyone seems to
      be in good spirits and hopefull. I sent my trunk from Annapolis to Washingt[illegible] to our Sutler, who keeps a place in Washington &nbsp;his name is L. Kipps &nbsp;cor of F &amp;
      9th St &nbsp;Model House

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Washington Whitman (1829â€“1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00353_n100">1. Ordered to follow General
      Meade's Army of the Potomac into Virginia, Burnside's Ninth Army Corps departed
      from Annapolis on April 23, 1864. Upon reaching Washington, D.C., on April 25,
      it passed in review before President Lincoln. As Captain Whitman marched through
      Washington with his regiment, Walt Whitman walked beside him. According to
      Walt's letter to his mother on ,
      George became so preoccupied with seeing his brother again that he failed to
      salute as the regiment passed the balcony occupied by Lincoln and Burnside.
      After marching through the city, the Ninth Army proceeded into Virginia. It was
      encamped at Fairfax Court House on April 28 and at Bristoe Station on April
      29.<a href="#r1">[back]
