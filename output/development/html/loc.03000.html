      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt—:.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yes; i.e. Baxter<sup><a href="#n6000" id="r2">2</a></sup> wrote me an indignant letter—enclosing clipping fr. some N. Y.
      paper—a hifalutin journalese acc't of the Japanese's outrageous act. It seems,
      then, that the set of the alleged conversations with you which he gave me was only
      a
      copy: I have them now somewhere. The duplicate wh. he retained he has pub.<u>d</u>,—where I can't quite make out, N. Y. Herald I
      suppose you mean.<sup><a href="#loc.03000_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> We were very sorry for yr sake: the damage done is irreparable I
      suppose. You remember, I wrote &amp; warned you that the fellow tried to pub. these
      things. We were both of us—you &amp; I—too careless. I should have tho't
      that he might have a duplicate, &amp; your good nature sh<u>d</u> not
      have hindered you writing him peremptorily &amp; severely not to pub.—However,
      with all my deep chagrin, I c<u>d</u> but laugh (long &amp; well),
      over little Stedman<sup><a href="#n1043" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; Holmes (I suppose the Holmes bit came out
      too). What the frantic-for-notoriety pap. reports is true as gospel, whether you
      said it or not. How w<u>d</u> it do for me to send to Stedman the
      card I rec'd fr. you anent yr alleged opinion of him à la Hartmann,<sup><a href="#n4980" id="r5">5</a></sup> (in which card you say good things of Stedman, &amp; deny that you
      hold the Hartmannian opinion) how wd it do for me to send this to Stedman? <u>I</u> was not going to mention the matter to you or to St. But since it has come
      out so publicly, this card w<u>d</u> serve as a sort of rebuttal
      &amp; <u>amende</u> perhaps. You say in it "as to my alleged opinion
      of Stedman: I have no such opinion.<sup><a href="#loc.03000_n1" id="r6">6</a></sup> My feeling toward S. is one of good will &amp;
      thanks markedly—O'C<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r7">7</a></sup> says he is a good fellow, &amp; I say so too."
   </p>
   
   <p>But no: I w<u>d</u> not dare to send this card. Stedman w<u>d</u> never forgive my <u>trying to comfort
         him</u>. Ha! ha! The worst of the damnable business is that it sh<u>d</u> come so close on the heels of that at bottom
      warm-hearted (if conceited &amp; patronizing—slightly—) letter of S's to
      you. Hang it, hang 
      it. Damn these foreign adventurers say I.
   </p>   
   
   <p>I think I shall now pitch overboard fr my book the Hartmannian lading (supplement)
      entirely.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have a day off to-day: am resting by varnishing, shellac-ing &amp;c
      inside—polishing the nacre of the shell.
   </p>
   
   <p>Glad to hear that the Sarrazin book<sup><a href="#loc.03000_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup> is out. Will make note thereof.
   </p>

      With affec. regards to yrself &amp; the senior members of our masculine
      comrade-family—the three or four—when you write 'em.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.03000_n4">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked: North Cambridge Sta.,
      Mass. | May 7 | 8AM | 1888; Camden, N.J. | May 8 | 10AM | 1888 | Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n6000">2. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03000_n2">3. In William Sloane
      Kennedy's manuscript of his projected book on Whitman he recorded the following
      which "Whitman is said to have said" to the art historian C. Sadakichi Hartmann:
      "E. C. Stedman is after all nothing more than a sophistical dancing master. If
      Hercules or Apollo should make their appearance, he would look at them with the
      eye of a dancing master" (Trent Collection, Duke University). Hartmann
      attributed the remark to Whitman in the <em>New York Herald</em>
      on April 14, 1889. It is the publication of this article, which Kennedy feels
      misrepresents Whitman's words and opinions, that Kennedy is referring to as an
      "outrageous act" that stands to damage the poet's reputation.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1043">4. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4980">5. C. Sadakichi Hartmann (ca.
      1867–1944) was an art historian and early critic of photography as an art
      form. He visited Whitman in Camden in the 1880s and published his conversations
      with the poet in 1895. Generally unpopular with other supporters of the poet, he
      was known during his years in Greenwich Village as the "King of Bohemia." For
      more information about Hartmann, see John F. Roche, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_113.html">Hartmann, C. Sadakichi (ca. 1867–1944)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03000_n1">6. Kennedy is referring to a
      letter that Whitman sent to him on  in which the poet expressed respect and "good will" toward
      Stedman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">7. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03000_n3">8. Kennedy is referring to
      Gabriel Sarrazin's <em>La Renaissance de la Poésie Anglaise,
         1798–1889</em> (Paris: Perrin, 1889). For Whitman's enthusiastic
      response to Sarrazin's book, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.27.html">Saturday, May 4, 1889</a>; see also Whitman's , letter to Karl Knortz.<a href="#r8">[back]
