      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>All about as usual—Rec'd a London letter day before yesterday, purchasing six sets of my books &amp; a dozen <em>Democratic Vistas</em> (separate)—&amp; remitting the pay<sup><a href="#upa.00194_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—(come in good for Christmas pocket money)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Spent last evening till midnight with my friend Dr Bucke, of Canada, Supt of the great Gov't Insane Asylum, &amp; Mrs B, who are over here just for a day or so at Continental Hotel,
      Phila:<sup><a href="#upa.00194_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—They return to N Y this afternoon, &amp; will call upon you—I have known Doctor B for
      a couple of years, &amp; what I know, I <em>like well</em>—Mrs B, mother of a large family of children, seems to me a woman one would <em>love &amp; respect more &amp; more</em> as one knew her—But you will see them—they return to London, Canada, in a few days—Your
      &amp; Herby's letters rec'd—My sister &amp; brother well—heavy storms &amp; gales here, but brighter to-day—

   <p id="upa.00194_n2">2. On this occasion Dr.
      Richard Maurice Bucke presented to Whitman a copy of <em>Man's
         Moral Nature</em> (1879): "I dedicate this book to the man who inspired
      it—to the man who of all men past and present that I have known has the
      most exalted moral nature—to WALT WHITMAN." During the year Bucke sent to
      Whitman his pamphlet entitled <em>The Moral Nature and the Great
         Sympathetic</em> (1878) "with the author's affectionate regards"
      (presentation copy in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
