      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter last week a couple of hours after I sent mine. I have written
      to
      Hannah. Well, mother, we have had a spell of warm weather here—&amp; last
      night &amp; this morning we are having quite a rain—I can see the difference
      this morning already—the grass &amp; trees are beginning to look
      green—they have made a large flower garden right in front of my window at the
      office.

   <p>Wm O'Connor is coming on to New York to stop three days—he goes on
      to-night—he may call on Jeff at the City Hall—but may-be not—H.
      J. Raymond wants him to come to New York &amp; write for the <em>Times</em> &amp;c—but I don't know as he will go<sup><a href="#duk.00646_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I went to a concert last night—Brignoli &amp; Parepa<sup><a href="#duk.00646_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—nothing very
      great—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing new at the office—I went up to the Supreme Court last Friday,
      &amp; heard the Attorney General Mr. Stanbery make quite a great speech—he is
      a good speaker—you would have liked it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was down at the hospital Sunday—there was one poor young man, a Maryland
      boy<sup><a href="#duk.00646_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>, very bad from delirium
      tremens—(such cases are getting quite common)—this young man saw such
      sights &amp; terrible things, he took it into his head that the Almighty was in a
      rage, &amp; punishing him—&amp; he just got on his knees, &amp; <em>remained so for over 12 hours</em>, praying away for
      mercy—so the wardmaster told me—I sat by him some time—he told
      me, "<em>they</em>" went away while I was with him—he said he
      could hear "<em>them</em>," a good ways off—but they wouldn't
      come near him while I was there—he got into quite a little nap while I
      remained—you know if the delirium tremens patients can only get a few hours
      good sleep the worst is over—they are rational on most things—One of
      these men, in the hospital, had an idea there was a great cat gnawing at his arm,
      &amp; eating it—he had this idea for days &amp; days, &amp; of course suffered
      awfully—One of the watchmen of the Treasury, (formerly a Captain in the army,
      in an Ohio reg't,) is there in the hospital, with delirium tremens—So you see
      what troubles there are in the world, of one kind &amp; another—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are quite busy at the office—have a good many people coming—so it is
      quite lively—We had a clerk here, who was a great nuisance to every body, a
      young sprig of a Virginian—he has cleared out, forced to resign—we are
      all very glad—it makes a great relief—all the rest of us get along like
      brothers—I like them all, &amp; they like me.

   <p>If Mary &amp; the girls come, you must give them my love, &amp; tell Mary I shall
      send her a small package of books soon—I will send word before.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Tell Hattie she must behave like a lady &amp; try to learn—Uncle Walt is
      coming home soon, to see her<sup><a href="#duk.00646_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

      Henry Jarvis Raymond (1820–1869) established the New York <em>Daily Times</em> on September 18, 1851. Raymond termed <em>The Good Gray Poet</em> "the most brilliant monograph in
      our literature" (Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs</em>
      [Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1931], 35), and invited O'Connor to
      review <em>Leaves of Grass</em> on December 2, 1866 (see
      Whitman's  letter to Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman).<br><br>
      Evidently Raymond was considering O'Connor for a position on the New York <em>Times</em>. On ,
      O'Connor wrote that he had heard from Raymond—"a sort of hankering
      treatment of the subject, but no offer."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00646_n2">2. Pasquale Brignoli
      (1824–1884), the Italian tenor, and Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa
      (1836–1876), the English soprano, gave a recital at Metzerott Hall, of
      which the <em>National Republican</em> reported: "Their
      performances last evening were all that heart and cultivated taste could
      demand." According to Gay Wilson Allen, "The Singer in the Prison" described
      Parepa-Rosa's concert in Sing Sing Prison (<em>Walt Whitman
         Handbook</em> [Chicago, Packard and Company, 1946], 195).<a href="#r2">[back]
