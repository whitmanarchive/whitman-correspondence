   <p>I send you the within just rec'd from Herbert G.<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I
      have an idea that he will be on here Monday or Tuesday—If the spirit moves
      me &amp; the weather is fine, I may come down Sunday, (before you get
      this)—but possibly not—so I 
      tho't
      
       I w'd send you the present screed—Showery &amp; almost cool here
      the last two days. As I write, the sun is out, &amp; my bird singing—I
      have had my dinner, mutton-stew, onions, &amp; greens—(I used the vinegar
      you gave me on 'em—good—the bottle is most all gone, &amp; I shall
      bring it down to be fill'd up)—I have not felt as well as usual the last
      three days— we had it hot &amp; disagreeable enough here
      previous—Susan come up here &amp; stay awhile &amp; visit
      us—George<sup><a href="#n0852e" id="r2">2</a></sup> too—Mrs. D<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> would be glad too—Lord be easy with you
      both—

   <p> I arrived here from the "Germanic" a few hours ago:—think that I shall
      stay here in the Germanic 4 or 5 days, not more, and then shall come on to
      Camden, where I want to lodge, if I can find a lodging. —simply, one
      decent clean bedroom will do for me.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0262">1. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <p id="n0914">4. John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.<a href="#r4">[back]
