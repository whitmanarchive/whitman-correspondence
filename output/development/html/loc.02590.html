      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir, 
      
   </p>
   
   <p> From a perusal of your delightful book, "Specimen Days in
      America,"—recently published in England—I learn that you had seen
      Charles Dickens, among other notables who frequented Broadway.<sup><a href="#loc.02590_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>   
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I am preparing for publication a work entitled "Dickens portrayed by pen and
      pencil," an important feature of which will be (as the enclosed prospectus
      shows), several unpublished reminiscences of the 
       great
      Novelist, including recollections and impressions of his personality, furnished
      by his most intimate friends. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I venture to ask if you will lend your valuable aid in promoting the success of
      my scheme by favouring me with a record of your recollections and impressions of
      Dickens. So many of his friends having willingly acceded to my wishes in this
      respect, that I feel justified in entertaining a hope that the nature of the
      subject may induce you to do likewise. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I need hardly say that anything from your hand, whether of a personal  or critical
      character, in relation to Dickens, will be most highly esteemed by 
   </p>

      <em></span><span class="handshift">AUTHOR OF</em>

      HUMOURIST," "D<em>ICKENSIANA</em>," ETC.
      
   </p>
   ——————————<br>
   
   
   
   <p>
      </span><span class="handshift">THE principal features
      of this work, as already stated, will consist— <em>First,</em> of an Account of all the various Portraits of Charles
      Dickens, whether by painter, sculptor, engraver, or photographer, with
      illustrative anecdotes, memoranda relative to "sittings," and other
      interesting circumstances connected with the production of each particular
      portrait. 
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">
      <em>Second,</em> of a Series of "Pen-Portraits," or records of
      impressions produced by the personal appearance of Charles Dickens, as
      presented to the minds of friends, critic, and other noteworthy people who
      came in contact with him. 
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">
      <em>Third,</em> of Engraved Portraits representing the great
      Novelist at various periods, ranging from 1835 to 1870, and displaying in a
      graphic manner (more marked perhaps that we can recall in the portraits of
      any contemporary) the transitions from youth to manhood and age. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
      </span><span class="handshift">Some misapprehension appears to exist with regard
      to the second feature of this work. A few of the author's correspondents
      evidently suppose he contemplates a work of a biographical nature; an
      intention which, cognisant as he is of the existing "Life" by Forster, he
      hastens to disclaim; nor has he the remotest intention of entering into
      competition with that admirable biography. This declaration he trusts will
      suffice to remove any objection on the part of  the few whose
      "impressions" would so materially enhance the interest of this work, but who
      have hitherto hesitated to supply such particulars as would constitute a
      "Pen-Portrait." 
   </p>
   
   <p>
      </span><span class="handshift">If we could know Shakespeare as we know Johnson,
      much would be gained. To describe Dickens, and to record the impressions of
      those who have seen or known him, the writer hopes, is to satisfy a laudable
      curiosity. That this may be done while opportunity remains is his sincere
      endeavor. In this attempt he has the satisfaction of acknowledging the
      sanction and kindly help of members of the Dickens family, the valuable
      assistance fo those who have been co-workers with the Novelist, the cheerful
      co-operation of artists and other friends, besides promises of further aid
      which will be gratefully acknowledged in the proper place.* 
   </p>
   
   <p>
      </span><span class="handshift">Some of the author's correspondents have
      expressed their inability to contribute to his work because they had no
      intimate acquaintance with Dickens, and had only met him on one or two
      occasions. He ventures to point out that personal intimacy is not absolutely
      requisite in forming a mental impression of the outward characteristics of
      an individual: that, in fact, mere contact will suffice for such a purpose.
      In such a case as that of Charles Dickens, the wonderful creations of whose
      fertile brain excited a laudable desire on the part of many of his readers
      and admirers to behold with their own eyes the magician himself, it is
      natural to suppose that such curiosity would induce them to critically
      examine his outward appearance, and to form an impression that would not
      soon be effaced. As a notable illustration of his meaning the graphic,
      terse, and vivid portraiture by Carlyle may be given. Having met "Boz" for
      the firs time at a dinner, he thus described his impressions of the young
      writer:— 
   </p>
   
   <p> "....Nay, Pickwick, too, was of the same dinner party, though they do
      not seem to heed him over-much. He is a fine little fellow—Boz, I
      think. Clear blue, intelligent eyes, eyebrows that he arches amazingly,
      large protrusive rather loose mouth, a face of most extreme <em>mobility</em>, which he shuttles about—eyebrows,
      eyes, mouth and all—in a very singular manner while speaking.
      Surmount this with a loose coil of common-coloured hair, and set it on a
      small compact figure, very small, and 
      ——————————<br>
      
      <p> *He has much pleasure in being
         able to include in his list the names of the following special
         contributors:—Miss Dickens, Mrs. Perugini (Miss Kate Dickens), Mr.
         Charles Dickens, jun., Miss Mary Boyle, Mr. E. L. Blanchard, Rev. E.
         Bradley ("Cuthbert Bede"), Mr. Percy Fitzgerald, M.A., Mr. W. P. Frith, R.A., Miss
         Margaret Gillies, Lady Jodrell, Mr. Charles Kent, Sir F. Leighton, Kt.,
         P.R.A., Lady Helena Martin, Sir Arthur
         Sullivan, Kt., Mrs. E. M. War, M.A., Mr. T.
         Woolner, R.A., &amp;c.

   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      dressed à la D'Orsay rather than well—this is Pickwick.
      For the rest a quiet, shrewd-looking, little fellow, who seems to guess
      pretty well what he is and what others are...." 
      
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift"> John Forster thus records his earliest
      impressions:—
   </p>
   
   <p>
      "A look of youthfulness first attracted you, and then a candour and
      openness of expression which made you sure of the qualities within. The
      features were very good. He had a capital forehead, a firm nose with
      full wide nostril, eyes wonderfully beaming with intellect and running
      over with humour an cheerfulness, and a rather prominent mouth strongly
      marked with sensibility. The head was altogether well-formed and
      symmetrical, and the air and carriage of it were extremely spirited. The
      hair so scant and grizzled in later days was then of a rich brown and
      most luxuriant abundance, and the bearded face of his last two decades
      had hardly a vestige of hair or whisker; but there was that in the face
      as I first recollect it which no time could change, and which remained
      implanted on it unalterably to the last. This was the quickness,
      keenness, and practical power, the eager, restless, energetic outlook on
      each several feature, that seemed to tell so little of a student or
      writer of books, and so much of a man of action and business in the
      world. Light and motion flashed form every part of it."
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      </span><span class="handshift">Of a man so various there must be many portraits.
      The author has set about collecting with a view of presenting to his readers
      a complete gallery, displaying an infinite variety of touch and detail, by
      pen and pencil, the <em>portraiture</em> of the subject of his
      volume. He ventures to hope the nature of the undertaking, and the unusual
      interest of the subject, will induce those who have not yet enlisted in the
      service to favour him with their impressions, recollections, or any
      reminiscences of our favourite writer.
