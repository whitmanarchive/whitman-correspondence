   <p>I have been wandering up and down the house and [

       to hear from Lord Houghton so as to get you two together here on the banks of the
      Hudson, but he has gone on West the other [
      <span class="unclear">way?</span>]
      . He will return this
      
      
      
      
      [
      <span class="unclear">way?</span>]
       so soon as he has <u>done</u> the West [
      <span class="unclear">when?</span>]
       I hope to [
      <span class="unclear">catch?</span>]
       him and then if we do not get down to see you you are to try and get up here if possible:
      Yet it may be that Houghton will not get back till too late for [
      <span class="unclear">me here?</span>]
      . In that case we will try and get together in New York City. I am off to old [
      <span class="unclear">free?</span>]
       Boston on [
      <span class="unclear">Biz &amp;?</span>]
       pleasure
      
      
      and [
      <span class="unclear">as usual?</span>]
       know not when I shall get back: but let me hear from you <u>here</u> for I am very anxious indeed to hear of your health. Do [
      <span class="unclear">keep?</span>]
       up my dear fellow there is lots in the tomorrows for you and I want you to live to
      see the Great Sunrise. Now you <u>must</u> answer me and [
      <span class="unclear">send me the?</span>]
       <u>proof</u> sheets. By that time I shall have [
      <span class="unclear">returned?</span>]
       and will [

       about what I shall do the next [

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Joaquin Miller was the pen name of Cincinnatus Heine
      Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of the Rockies" and
      "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <em>Westminster Review</em>
      described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness which marked Walt Whitman's
      poetry." In an entry in his journal dated August 1, 1871, John Burroughs
      recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's poetry; see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin Co., 1931), 60. Whitman met Miller for the first time later in 1872; he
      wrote of a visit with Miller in a 
      letter to Charles W. Eldridge.
