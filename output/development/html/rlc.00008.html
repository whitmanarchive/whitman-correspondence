      <br></br><br></br>My dear Rudolf Schmidt<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n0793" id="r1">1</a></sup>,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of Jan. 2<sup><a href="#rlc.00008_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> has just reached me here. I am always
      glad to get word from you. Write oftener. I have been very ill—now just a
      year—from paralysis &amp; <em>cerebral anæmia</em>. I have been at
      death's door myself—&amp; during the year have lost my dear mother<sup><a href="#n0705" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; a dear sister<sup><a href="#n0707" id="r4">4</a></sup> by death. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I sent you a newspaper, with account, five months since, but as you do not allude
      to it I
      suppose you did not receive it. I send another by this mail. (I have sent you several
      papers
      &amp; magazines the past year.) I am not in bed but up &amp; dressed, &amp; go out a little
      every day, &amp; shall probably get well again—But I remain paralyzed yet—walk
      with difficulty &amp; very little—have bad spells in my head—&amp; ameliorate
      very slowly—Still I write &amp; publish a little—Mental faculties not affected. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have at present no thought of visiting England.<sup><a href="#rlc.00008_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> In a letter
      two years since Tennyson kindly invited me to come to his house<sup><a href="#rlc.00008_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup>—which aroused some thought &amp; wish for a time—but it has passed away. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>What have I heard about some great German University, proposing for one of its prizes,
      for
      some annual or bi-annual literary <em>fête</em>, the question, <em>Has America really produced any real poet?</em> Have you heard any thing of
      such a discussion? 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>What about Bjornson? Is he coming to America? If so, give him my address, &amp; tell him
      to
      come &amp; see me. (It is almost a part of Philadelphia, where I now live—on the
      opposite side of the Delaware river.) 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When you write, or send me (the Danish) Democratic Vistas, direct here. Write me from
      Germany,
      
      <br><br>Walt Whitman
      <br>431 Stevens street,
      <br>Camden, N. Jersey.
      <br>U. S. America
      
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>(I have not given up my place in the Solicitor's office, Washington—but keep up
      communication—&amp; if I get well, expect to go back there)—I want to hear all
      about Bjornson—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0793">1. Rudolf Schmidt, a Dane and
      editor of <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em>, is credited with
      introducing Walt Whitman to Scandinavia by quoting translated passages from <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in a 1872 essay in his magazine. He wrote
      to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871:
      "I intend to write
      an article about yourself and your writings in the above named periodical which
      is very much read in all the Scandinavian countries. ... I therefore take the
      liberty to ask you, if you should not be willing to afford some new
      communications of yourself and your poetry to this purpose" (The Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00008_n1">2. In his  letter, Schmidt reported that the first part of his translation
      of <em>Democratic Vistas</em> had gone to the printers: "It is a
      devilish hard task to translate your prose, and our ordinary translators most
      surely would break the neck in trying it."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0705">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0707">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman (d. 1873) known as "Mattie,"
      was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and
      Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
      the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat
      ailment that would lead to her death in 1873.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00008_n2">5. Schmidt had been told by "an American
      gentleman" that Walt Whitman was going to England.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00008_n3">6. Tennyson had extended this invitation in his
       letter to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
