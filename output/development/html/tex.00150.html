      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I suppose you got two letters from me last week, Wednesday &amp; Saturday—My cold still
      troubles me some—I have a good deal of pain in the head—I think it is neuralgia—but
      I guess I shall get over it—I have good meals, I do not cook for myself, at present—but
      get my grub at a good New England restaurant—Mother, I received your letter a week
      ago—there is nothing new in the office—the poor Attorney General has a cataract forming
      on one of his eyes, &amp; will have to undergo a surgical operation—Mother, I told you
      all about my promotion &amp; appointment to a regular berth, in Saturday's letter—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, mother dear, I will bid you good bye for this week—</p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>Walt.
