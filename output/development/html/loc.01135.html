   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01135_n1">1. The envelope for this letter
      bears the address: John Burroughs | Esopus-on-Hudson | Ulster Co: | New York. It
      is postmarked: Camden | Feb | 21 | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01135_n2">2. Whitman received a check
      for $25 from Burroughs on February 20 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]

      Burroughs's hired hand. See the letter from Whitman to John Burroughs of .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01135_n4">4. <em>Studies
         of the Greek Poets</em> was published in a two-volume edition in
      1879–1880 in Boston.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01135_n5">5. On February 16 Whitman
      received from Ruskin £10 for five sets of books through Herbert J. Bathgate, to
      whom the books were sent on February 19 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). In a letter on , Bathgate quoted a recent communication from Ruskin: "The reason
      neither he (yourself) nor Emerson are read in England is first—that they
      are deadly true—in the sense of rifles—against all our deadliest
      sins. The second that this truth is asserted with an especial colour of American
      egotism which good English scholars cannot, and bad ones will not endure. This
      is the particular poison and tare by which the Devil has rendered their fruit
      ungatherable but by gleaning and loving hands, or the blessed ones of the poor."
      The first sentence of this letter was quoted in <em>The
         Athenaeum</em> on March 20, 1880. See also the letter from Whitman to
      William Harrison Riley of .<a href="#r5">[back]

      postscript: "Please give my love to John Burroughs when you write or see him"
      (<em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em>, ed.
      Thomas B. Harned [New York: Doubleday, Page &amp; Company, 1918], 192). Beatrice
      Gilchrist was studying medicine in Switzerland.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01135_n7">7. On , Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke asked Whitman
      for "a sketch of your interior life—especially in relation to the
      conception and elaboration of 'Leaves of Grass.'" On  he acknowledged receipt of articles about the poet by
      O'Connor, Burroughs, and Gilchrist, and again requested more "inward and
      outward" facts about the poet's life. On  Bucke noted his recent lectures on Whitman's poetry and his
      arrangements for the sale of his works, a subject to which he again referred in
      letters on  and . In his "circular" soliciting information about the poet,
      Bucke wrote: "I am myself fully satisfied that WALT WHITMAN is one of the
      greatest men, if not the very greatest man, that the world has so far produced"
      (The Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection of English and American Literature,
      New York Public Library).<a href="#r7">[back]
