      How often since that dark and dripping Saturday—that chilly April day, now </span><span>twenty-one </span><span class="handshift">years bygone—my heart has entertain'd the dream, the wish, to give of Abraham Lincoln's
      death its own special thought and memorial. Yet now the sought-for opportunity offers,
      I find my notes incompetent, (why, for truly profound themes, is statement so idle?
      why does the right phrase never offer?) and the fit tribute I dreamed of waits unprepared
      as ever. My talk here indeed is less because of itself or anything in it, and nearly
      altogether because I feel a desire, apart from any talk, to specify the day, the martyrdom.
      It is for this, my friends, I have called you together. Oft as the rolling years bring
      back this hour, let it again however briefly be dwelt upon. For my own part, I hope
      and intend, till my own dying day, whenever the 14th or 15th of April comes, to annually
      gather a few friends, and hold its tragic reminiscence. No narrow or sectional reminiscence.
      It belongs to These States in their entirety—not the North only, but the South—perhaps
      belongs most tenderly and devoutly to the South, of all: for there, really, this man's
      birth-stock. There and thence his antecedent stamp. Why should I not say that thence
      his manliest traits—his universality—his canny, easy ways and words upon the surface—his
      inflexible determination and courage at heart? Have you never realized it, my friends,
      that Lincoln, though grafted on the West, is essentially, in personnel and character,
      a Southern contribution?

      Though by no means proposing to resume the Secession War to-night, I would briefly
      remind you of the public conditions preceding that contest. For twenty years, and
      especially during the four or five before the war actually began, the aspect of affairs
      in the United States, though without the flash of military excitement, presents more
      than the survey of a battle, or any extended campaign, or series, even of Nature's
      convulsions. The hot passions of the South—the strange mixture at the North of inertia,
      incredulity, and conscious power—the incendiarism of the Abolitionists—the rascality
      and grip of the politicians, unparalleled in any land, any age. To these I must not
      omit adding the honesty of the essential bulk of the people everywhere—yet with all
      the seething fury and contradiction of their natures more aroused than the Atlantic's
      waves in wildest equinox.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">
      What could be more ominous, (though generally unappreciated then)—what more significant
      than the Presidentiads of Fillmore and Buchanan? proving conclusively that the weakness
      and wickedness of elected rulers, backed by our great parties, are just as likely
      to afflict us here, as in the countries of the Old World, under their monarchies,
      emperors and aristocracies. In that Old World were everywhere heard underground rumblings,
      that died out, only again surely to return. While in America the volcano, though civic
      yet, continued to grow more and more convulsive—more and more stormy and threatening.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">
      In the height of all this excitement and chaos, hovering on the edge at first, and
      then merged in its very midst, and destined to play a leading part, appears a strange
      and awkward figure.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p></span><span><u>First sight of Mr Lincoln</u></p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">
      I shall not easily forget the first time I ever saw Abraham Lincoln. It must have
      been about the 18th or 19th of February, 1861. It was rather a pleasant afternoon
      in New-York City, as he arrived there from the West, to remain a few hours, and then
      pass on to Washington, to prepare for his inauguration. I saw him in Broadway, near
      the site of the present Post Office. He came down, I think, from Canal-st., to stop
      at the Astor House. The broad spaces, sidewalks and street in the neighborhood and
      for some distance, were crowded with solid masses of people—many thousands. The omnibuses
      and other vehicles had all been turned off, leaving an unusual hush in that busy part
      of the city. Presently two or three shabby hack barouches made their way with some
      difficulty through the crowd and drew up at the Astor House entrance. A tall figure
      stepped out of the centre of these barouches, paused leisurely on the sidewalk, looked
      up at the dark granite walls and looming architecture of the grand old hotel—then,
      after a relieving stretch of arms and legs, turned round for over a minute to scan
      slowly and good-humoredly the appearance of the vast and silent crowds. There were
      no speeches—no compliments—no welcome—as far as I could hear, not a word said. Still
      much anxiety was concealed in that quiet. Cautious persons had feared some marked
      insult or indignity to the President-elect—for he possessed no personal popularity
      at all in New-York City, and very little political. But it was evidently tacitly agreed
      that if the few political supporters of Mr. Lincoln pres</span><span>ent </span><span class="handshift">would entirely abstain from any demonstration on their side, the immense majority,
      who were any thing but supporters, would abstain on their side also. The result was
      a sulky, unbroken silence, such as certainly never before characterized so great a
      New-York crowd.
   </p>
   
   <p>              </span><span class="handshift">      
      Almost in the same neighborhood I distinctly remembered seeing Lafayette, on his visit
      to America in 1825. I had also personally seen and heard how Andrew Jackson, Clay,
      Webster, Hungarian Kossuth, Filibuster Walker, the Prince of Wales on his visit, and
      other cèlébres, native and foreign, had been welcomed there, at various times—all
      that indescribable human roar and magnetism, unlike any other sound in the universe,
      the glad exulting thunder-shouts of countless unloosed throats of men! But on this
      occasion, not a voice—not a sound.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">
      From the top of </span><span>an </span><span class="handshift">omnibus, (driven up one side, close by, and blocked by the curbstone and the crowds)
      I had a capital view of it all, and especially of Mr. Lincoln, his look and gait—his
      perfect composure and coolness—his unusual and uncouth height, dress of complete black,
      stovepipe hat pushed back on the head, dark-brown complexion, seamed and wrinkled
      yet canny-looking face, black, bushy head of hair, disproportionately long neck, and
      hands held behind as he stood observing the people. He looked with curiosity upon
      that immense sea of faces, and the sea of faces returned the look with similar curiosity.
      In both there was a dash of comedy, almost farce, such as Shakspeare puts in his blackest tragedies. The crowd that hemmed around consisted, I should
      think, of thirty to forty thousand men, not a single one his personal friend—while
      I have no doubt (so frenzied were the ferments of the time) many an assassin's knife
      and pistol lurked in hip or breast-pocket there, ready, soon as break and riot came.
   </p>
   
   <p>          </span><span class="handshift">          
      But no break or riot came. The tall figure gave another relieving stretch or two of
      arms and legs; then with moderate pace, and accompanied by a few unknown looking persons,
      ascended the portico steps of the Astor House, disappeared through its broad entrance—and
      the dumb-show ended.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">
      I saw Abraham Lincoln often the four years following that date. He changed rapidly
      and much during his Presidency—but this scene and him in it, are indelibly stamped
      upon my recollection. As I sat on the top of my omnibus, and had a good view of him,
      the thought, dim and inchoate then, has since come out clear enough, that four sorts
      of genius, four mighty and primal hands, will be needed to the complete </span><span>the </span><span class="handshift">limning of this man's future portrait—the eyes and brains and finger-touch of Plutarch
      and Æschylus and Michel Angelo, assisted by Rabelais.
      
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">THE WAR—</span><span>Future literature of it.</p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">
      And now (Mr. Lincoln passing on from this scene to Washington, where he was inaugurated,
      amid armed cavalry, and sharpshooters at every point—</span><span>(</span><span class="handshift">the first instance of the kind in our history, and I hope it will be the last) how
      the rapid succession of well-known events, </span><span>(</span><span class="handshift">too well known—I believe, these days, we almost hate to hear them mentioned</span><span>)</span><span class="handshift">—the National flag fired on at Sumter, the uprising of the North in paroxysms of astonishment
      and rage, the chaos of divided councils, the call for troops, the first Bull Run,
      the stunning cast-down, shock, and dismay of the North: and so in full flood the Secession
      War. Four years of lurid, bleeding, murky, murderous war. Who paint those years, with
      all their scenes?—the hard-fought engagements—the defeats, plans, failures—the gloomy
      hours, days, when our Nationality seemed hung in pail of doubt, perhaps death—the
      Mephistophelean sneers of foreign lands and attachés—the dreaded Scylla of European
      interference, and the Charybdis of the tremendously dangerous latent strata of secession
      sympathizers throughout the Free States (far more numerous than is supposed)—the long
      marches in Summer—the hot sweat, and many a sunstroke, as on the rush to Gettysburg
      in '63—the night battles in the woods, as under Hooker at Chancellorsville (a strange
      episode)—the camps in Winter—the military prisons—the hospitals—(alas! alas! the hospitals).
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">
      The Secession War? Nay, let me call it the Union War. Though whatever called it is
      even yet too near us—too vast and too closely overshadowing—its branches unformed
      yet (but certain), shooting too far into the future—and the most indicative and mightiest
      of them yet ungrown.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">
      A great literature will yet arise out of the era of those four years, those scenes—era
      compressing centuries of native passion, first-class pictures, tempests of life and
      death—an inexhaustible mine for the histories, drama, romance and even philosophy
      of peoples to come—indeed the verteber of poetry and art (of personal character, too,)
      for all future America—far more grand, in my opinion, to the hands capable of it,
      than Homer's siege of Troy, or the French wars to Shakespeare.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">But I must leave these speculations and come to the theme I have assigned and limited
      myself to.
   </p>
   
   <p><u>Real events of the murder</u></p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">
      Of the actual murder of President Lincoln, though so much has been written, probably
      the facts are yet very indefinite in most persons' minds. I read from my memoranda,
      written at the time, and revised frequently and finally since.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">
      The day, April 14, 1865, seems to have been a pleasant one throughout the whole land—the
      moral atmosphere pleasant too—the long storm, so dark, so fratricidal, full of blood
      and doubt and gloom, over and ended at last by the sun-rise of such an absolute National
      victory, and utter break-down of secessionism—we almost doubted our own senses! Early
      herbage, early flowers, were out. (I remember where I was stopping at the time, the
      season being advanced, there were many lilacs in full bloom. By one of those caprices
      that enter and give tinge to events without being at all a part of them, I find myself
      always reminded of the great tragedy of that day by the sight and odor of these blossoms.
      It never fails.)

      But I must not dwell on accessories. The deed hastens. The popular afternoon paper
      of Washington, the little <em>Evening Star</em>, had spattered all over its third page, divided among the advertisements in a sensational
      manner, in a hundred different places, "The President and his Lady will be at the
      Theatre this evening." (Lincoln was fond of the theatre. I have myself seen him there
      several times. I remember thinking how funny it was that he, in some respects the
      leading actor in the stormiest drama known to real history's stage through centuries,
      should sit there and be so completely interested and absorbed in those human jack-straws,
      moving about with their silly little gestures, foreign spirit, and flatulent text.)

      Thus the visible incidents and surroundings of President Lincoln's murder, as they
      really occurred. Thus ended the attempted secession of these States. Thus the four
      years' war. But the main things come subtly and invisibly afterward, perhaps long
      afterward—neither military, political, nor (great as those are,) historical. I say,
      certain secondary and indirect results, out of this death, are, in my opinion, greatest.
      Not the event of the murder itself. Not that Mr. Lincoln strings the principal points
      and personages of the period, like beads, upon the single string of his career. Not
      that his idiosyncracy, in its sudden appearance and disappearance, stamps this Republic
      with a stamp more marked and enduring than any yet given by any one man—(more even
      than Washington's). But, joined with these, the immeasurable value and meaning of
      that whole tragedy lies, to me, in senses finally dearest to a Nation, (and here all
      our own)—the imaginative and artistic senses—the literary and dramatic ones. Not in
      any common or low meaning of those terms, but a meaning precious to the race, and
      to every age. A long and varied series of contradictory events arrives at last at
      its highest poetic, single, central, pictorial denouement. The whole involved, baffling,
      multiform whirl of the secession period comes to a head, and is gather'd in one brief
      flash of lightning-illumination—one simple, fierce deed. Its sharp culmination, and
      as it were solution, of so many bloody and angry problems, illustrates those climax-moments
      on the stage of universal Time, where the Historic Muse at one entrance, and the Tragic
      Muse at the other, suddenly ringing down the curtain, close an immense act in the
      long drama of creative thought, and give it radiation, tableau, stranger than fiction.
      Fit radiation—fit close! How the imagination—how the student loves these things! America,
      too, is to have them. For not in all great deaths, nor far or near—not Caesar in the
      Roman Senate-house, or Napoleon passing away in the wild night-storm at St. Helena—not
      Paleologus, falling, desperately fighting, piled over dozens deep with Grecian corpses—not
      calm old Socrates, drinking the hemlock—outvies that terminus of the Secession War,
      in one man's life, here in our midst, in our own time—that seal of the emancipation
      of three million slaves—that parturition and delivery of our at last really free Republic,
      born again, henceforth to commence its career of genuine homogeneous Union, compact,
      consistent with itself.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span><u>Only Battles and Deaths Condense a Nationality</u></p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">
      Nor will ever future American Patriots and Unionists, indifferently over the whole
      land, or North or South, find a better seal to their lesson. The final use of the
      greatest men of a nation is, after all, not with reference to their deeds in themselves,
      or their direct bearing on their times or lands. The final use of a heroic-eminent
      life—is its indirect filtering into the nation and the race, and to give, often at
      many removes, but unerringly, age after age, color and fibre to the personalism of
      the youth and maturity of that age, and of mankind. Then there is a cement to the
      whole people, subtler, more underlying, than any thing in written Constitution, or
      courts or armies—namely, the cement of a death identified thoroughly with that people,
      at its head, and for its sake. Strange, (is it not?) that battles, martyrs, agonies,
      blood, even assassination, should so condense—perhaps only really, lastingly condense—a
      nationality.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">
      I repeat it—the grand deaths of the race—the dramatic deaths of every nationality—are
      its most important inheritance-value—in some respects, beyond its literature and art—(as
      the hero is beyond his finest portrait, and the battle itself beyond its choicest
      song or epic.) Is not here indeed the point underlying all tragedy? the famous pieces
      of the Grecian Masters—and all masters? Why, if the old Greeks had had this man, what
      trilogies of plays—what epics—would have been made out of him! How the rhapsodes would
      have recited him! How quickly that quaint tall form would have entered into the region
      where men vitalize gods, and gods divinify men!
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">
      When, centuries hence, (as it must, in my opinion, be centuries hence before the life
      of these States, or of democracy, can be really written and illustrated,) the leading
      historians and dramatists seek for some personage, some special event, incisive enough
      to mark with deepest cut, and mnemonize, this turbulent nineteenth century of ours,
      (not only these States, but all over the political and social world)—something, perhaps,
      to close that gorgeous procession of European feudalism, with all its pomp and caste-prejudices,
      (of whose long train we in America are yet so inextricably the heirs)—something to
      identify with terrible identification, by far the greatest revolutionary step in the
      history of the United States, (perhaps the greatest of the world, our century)—the
      absolute extirpation and erasure of slavery from the States—those historians will
      seek in vain for any point to serve more thoroughly their purpose, than Abraham Lincoln's
      death.
      
      Dear to the Muse—thrice dear to Nationality—to the whole human race—precious to this
      Union—precious to Democracy—unspeakably and forever precious—their first great Martyr
      Chief.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Donaldson (1843–1898)
      was a Philadelphia attorney whom Whitman met in 1882. Donaldson helped to
      facilitate meetings between Whitman and Bram Stoker in the 1880s, and raised
      money for the purchase of a horse and buggy for Whitman in 1885. He also wrote a
      biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt Whitman: The Man</em> (New
      York: Francis P. Harper, 1896). For more about Whitman's relationship with
      Donaldson, see Steven Schroeder, "Donaldson, Thomas (1843–1898)," in <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em> (New York: Garland
      Publishing, 1998), 185.

   <p id="tex.00452_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      Rec'd | August 12—1886 | Thos Donaldson. It is addressed: Thomas Donaldson
      | 326 North 40th Street | Philadelphia. It is postmarked: Camden | Au (?) | 1

   <p id="tex.00452_n2">2. With this letter is a
      copy of Whitman's Lincoln lecture with directions to the printer; Whitman had
      corrected a newspaper account of the presentation of the lecture on April 15,
      1880 (see the letter from Whitman to William Reisdell of ). On March 26, 1885, Whitman gave copies of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> to Donaldson for Henry Irving and Bram
      Stoker (Whitman's Commonplace Book). On December 22, 1887, Stoker, accompanied
      by Donaldson, called on the poet, who presented them with pictures and copies of
      <em>As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free</em> for themselves as
      well as for Irving and Ellen Terry (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Terry thanked
      Whitman for the book on January 4, 1888. Though he saw Stoker later in 1886,
      Donaldson did not give him the lecture copy until 1894, after Whitman's death.
      For more information about Whitman's relationship with Bram Stoker and his
      influence on Stoker's own Lincoln lecture, see Robert J. Havlik, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00471.pdf">Walt

      state here on paper the uncertainties I feel about [Donaldson]." Kennedy, in
      short, was not sure that Donaldson deserved to be called a friend (or idolator)
      of the poet.<a href="#r3">[back]
