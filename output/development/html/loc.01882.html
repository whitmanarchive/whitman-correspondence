      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was extremely obliged to you for the present of your photograph &amp; books; the
      vol. of poems containing (what I now read for the first time in that stage) the
      important section of <u>Passage to India</u>, &amp; many modifications here &amp; there in other compositions. It happens that
      I have lately been compiling a vol. of selections from American Poets, &amp; I <u>had</u> had to use your earlier
      editions for  the
      purposes of this compilation: but I have now set those aside, &amp; used your new
      edition throughout—so the kind &amp; welcome gift came to me at a very
      apposite moment. I confess to a certain reluctance to lose the old title "A Voice
      out of the Sea" of that most splendid poem (rated by most of
      your English admirers, I observe, as the finest of all, 
      tho
      
       I am not prepared to acquiesce in that estimate): however, in this, as all
      others where the editions differ, I have followed your new edition. Many thanks also
      for the separate poem subsequently received "After all, not to create
      only"—replete with important  truths.—I don't well know when my "American Selection" will
      be out: my work on it is done, &amp; the rest depends on the printer &amp;
      publisher. I shall hope to beg your acceptance of a copy in due course.
   </p>
   
   <p>I sent on the copy of your works transmitted for "The Lady"
      after some little delay occasioned by my being absent from England up to the end of
      August. She was (&amp; I think still is) in the country: but, to judge from a letter
      of acknowledgement she wrote me, you have probably this time heard from her direct.
      I know also that you have heard from Prof. Dowden, the writer
      of the article  in the
      Westminster.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr. Burroughs called here on 5 Octr., &amp; is to dine with us tomorrow: I like his
      frank manly aspect &amp; tone, and need not say that you were a principal subject of
      conversation between us. He seems very considerably impressed with the objects &amp;
      matter of interest in London: I wish it might be my good fortune to see you here
      also 
      some day
      
      . 
      Rumours
      
       of your projected arrival have been rife for some while past, but, as I
      learn from Burroughs, the prospect is as yet not a very definite one.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Believe me
      <br></br>Most respectfully your friend,
      <br></br>W. M. Rossetti.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
