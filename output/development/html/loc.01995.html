   <p>I suppose you will think by this time that I have forgotten my Dear old Friend by
      my
      long silence &amp; neglect to answer your letter, or acknowledge the receipt of your
      paper that you was so kind as to send me, but I assure you that I have not forgot
      you but sill remember you with the same Love that [

   <p>We have had excellent Sleighing here for the past two or three weeks  and it still continues

   <p>I am at work in the Melodeon &amp; Piano Factory of A. C. Chase again and shall
      probably continue there this winter. My health is very good. Father has been quite

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The friendship of Whitman
      with this former soldier can be reconstructed from Wilson's letters in the
      Feinberg Collection. On July 18, 1869, Wilson recalled his confinement in Armory
      Square Hospital (see Whitman's ),
      "when your kind face &amp; pleasant words cheered the soldier Boys &amp; won
      their hearts. I never shall forget the first time you came in after David &amp;
      I got there. We Loved you from the first time we spoke to you." In Wilson's
      first letter, written on , he
      began: "I suppose you will think that I have forgotten you long before this time
      but I have not, your kindness to me while in the hospital will never be
      forgotten by me." After a lapse in the correspondence, he wrote on : "I wish if aggreable to yourself
      to keep up a regular correspondence between us . . . I think it will be of
      benefit to me morally and perhaps will not be of any detriment to you." In this
      letter he admitted that he had just discovered that Whitman was a poet. On
      January 27, 1867, he informed Whitman that he had been reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, but complained: "I wrote to you a year and more ago
      that I was married but did not receive any reply, so I did not know but you was
      displeased with it"; he concluded the letter: "I remain as ever your | Boy
      Friend | with Love | Benton H. Wilson." Whitman replied (lost), and sent William
      D. O'Connor's <em>The Good Gray Poet</em>, which Wilson
      acknowledged on February 3. On April 7, 1867, after he informed Whitman that his
      wife had gone to the hospital for her first confinement (the child was to be
      named Walt Whitman), he complained: "I am poor and am proud of it but I hope to
      rise by honesty and industry. I am a married man but I am not happy for my
      disposition is not right. I have got a good Woman and I love her dearly but I
      seem to lack patience or something. I think I had ought to live alone, but I had
      not ought to feel so." On April 21, Wilson acknowledged Whitman's reply of April
      12: "I do not want you to misunderstand my motives in writing to you of my
      Situation &amp; feelings as I did in my last letter or else I shall have to be
      more guarded in my letters to you. I wrote so because you wanted me to write how
      I was situated, and give you my mind without reserve, and all that I want is
      your advice and Love, and I do not consider it cold lecture or dry advice. I
      wish you to write to me just as you feel &amp; express yourself and advise as
      freely as you wish and will be satisfied." On September 15, Wilson wondered why
      Whitman had not replied. See also Whitman's letter to Benton H. Wilson from
      April 15, 1870 (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–69],
      1:182–184).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00513_n6">1. Andrew Johnson
      (1808–1875) became President of the United States after the assassination
      of Abraham Lincoln in 1865. Johnson was the first president to be impeached, but
      the Radical Republican efforts to remove him from office ultimately failed.
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman alludes to the <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Eagle</em>'s Democratic Party leanings and to its opposition to Johnson's
      impeachment. Louisa read widely in political news: she subscribed to the <em>Eagle</em> and at various times also read the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>New York
         Herald</em>, and the <em>Brooklyn Daily Union</em>. Walt
      Whitman in his  letter had advised
      his mother to "take a morning paper, the Times or something" because the debates
      on Johnson's impeachment "are quite interesting now." According to Louisa's  letter to Walt, she was also
      reading the <em>Washington Star</em>, presumably a copy that Walt
      had forwarded.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00638_n12">2. Ulysses S. Grant
      (1822–1885) was elected President of the United States in 1868 as the
      candidate of the Republican party. This letter was written very early in his
      first term. Grant was the most successful and highest ranking Union general of
      the Civil War. As commander of the Army of the Potomac, he accepted the
      surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox. He served two consecutive terms as
      president.<a href="#r2">[back]
