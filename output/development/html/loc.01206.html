   <p id="n3024">5. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.
      (1809–1894) was a Bostonian author, physician, and lecturer. One of the
      Fireside Poets, he was a good friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson as well as John
      Burroughs. Towards Whitman's poetry, Holmes remained ambivalent. He married
      Amelia Lee Jackson in 1840 and they had three children, including the later
      Supreme Court judge Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. For more information, see
      "Holmes, Oliver Wendell (1809-1894)," (<em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, eds. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 280).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n1029">6. John Greenleaf Whittier
      (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
      slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
      surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
      Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
      volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (various publishers: 1906–1996) and Whitman's "My Tribute to Four Poets,"
      in <em>Specimen Days</em> (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh &amp; Co.,
      1882–'83), 180–181.<a href="#r6">[back]
