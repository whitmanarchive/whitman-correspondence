      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I suppose you must have heard from Ashton that I received Mr. Otto's letter,<sup><a href="#nyp.00197_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; that I returned for answer that I would report myself to him on or about Tuesday
      24th instant. During the week previous to 16th I was quite sick, but this week I am
      about as well as usual.
   </p>
   
   <p>I intend to leave here on Monday 23d—shall take the 8 o'clock morning train, which
      will probably arrive in Washington about 7 in the evening. William, if you could hear
      of a room, I wish you would engage it for me—if Gwinne<sup><a href="#nyp.00197_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> has one, it would do—take the first good room you find, if any, irrespective of price—it
      would do for a week or so, any how—would like convenience for a fire, as I am susceptible
      to chill this winter.
   </p>
   
   <p>We got word yesterday by means of an exchanged prisoner, from my brother George, but
      only up to November 27—at that time he was at Danville, Virginia, in confinement with
      350 other officers. We hear that he is full of fortitude &amp; even good nature, but like
      all the rest, starved, miserable &amp; naked, to the last degree.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all well, home here. Last night another snow-storm, but fine &amp; sunshiny this
      morning—So far this winter, snow, rain, mud, melt, fog, with spells of sharp cold.
      I have received a letter from Charles Eldridge, from an island off in the sea, far
      beyond Boston. I suppose you got my letter of some ten days since. Nelly, I send you
      my love, &amp; hope you are well &amp; [in] good spirits. Farewell.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
      John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
      years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an intelligent man who
      deserved something better than the various governmental clerical posts he was to
      hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship, however, was relieved by the
      presence of Whitman whom he was to love and venerate—and defend with a
      single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of vituperation and eulogy that have
      seldom been equaled, most notably in his pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was
      the first, and in many ways the most important, of the adulators who divided
      people arbitrarily into two categories: those who were for and those who were
      against Walt Whitman. The poet praised O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous
      collection of his tales: "He was a born sample here in the 19th century of the
      flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his
      memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton,
      1910] pp. 513). For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>. Of the O'Connors, Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman wrote on : "I am
      real glad, my dear Walt, that you are among such good people. I hope it will be
      in the power of some of our family to return their kindness some day. I'm sure
      twould be done with a heartfelt gratitude. Tis pleasant, too, to think, that
      there are still people of that kind left."
