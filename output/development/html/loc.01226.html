      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Quite a long letter you wrote me:<sup><a href="#loc.01226_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> many thanks for it,
      &amp; for all the items of news it contained. I am glad Abagail<sup><a href="#loc.01226_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> called to see you. I urged her to do so weeks
      ago. I am very sorry you do not get out anymore. 
      Your
      
       right not to surrender in that way without a struggle.
   </p>
     
   
   <p>I keep pretty well, except a very bad cold lately, but the winter has been a vacant
      unprofitable one to me so far. My domestic skies are not pleasant &amp; I seem
      depressed &amp; restless most of the time. I am interested in that Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#n4152" id="r3">3</a></sup>—wish you had told me more about him. I should like to
      meet him if I know where he was to be seen. I saw an abstract of a lecture of his
      on
      the New Poetry, some months ago, that contained an admirable statement about your poetry. I will
      go &amp; hear him lecture if he speaks in N.Y.
   </p>
   
   <p>Two of the poems you enclosed were new to me. I liked them much. Your one to
      Whittier<sup><a href="#n1029" id="r4">4</a></sup> was very happy.<sup><a href="#duk.00865_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> A steady snow fall here
      to-day, the river a white plain. I dislike the winters more &amp; more &amp; shall
      not try to spend another in this solitude. Indeed I am thinking strongly of selling
      my place. I am
      sick of the whole business of housekeeping. If it was not for Julian<sup><a href="#loc.01151_n1" id="r6">6</a></sup> I should not hesitate a moment. J. goes to school &amp;
      is a bright happy boy, very eager for knowledge, &amp; with a quick intelligence. He
      alone makes life tolerable to me.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <p id="n1029">4. John Greenleaf Whittier
      (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
      slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
      surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
      Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
      volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (various publishers: 1906–1996) and Whitman's "My Tribute to Four Poets,"
      in <em>Specimen Days</em> (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh &amp; Co.,
      1882–'83), 180–181.<a href="#r4">[back]

         York Herald</em> on December 15 and in <em>Munyon's
         Illustrated World</em> in January 1888. Whitman received $10 from the
      latter (Whitman's Commonplace Book; Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
