      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> It is a perfect shame I have not written you for so long, but I have been wofully
      lame and ill, and with a mind so weak and wandering that most of the time I have
      been actually unable to write.<sup><a href="#syr.00023_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I now begin to feel a
      little better as the spring advances, though still greatly crippled. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I got your letter of last January (22d) and your card of Feb. 3rd from Elkton,<sup><a href="#syr.00023_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> telling  of your lecturing, at which proof of your activity I greatly
      rejoiced. I saw in the <u>Tribune</u> today that you are to give
      your Lincoln lecture in Philadelphia.<sup><a href="#loc.01337_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>   
   
   <p> I wonder if Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> got off. I had a letter from him some
      time ago telling me he expected to go, but have not since heard from him. 
   </p>
   
   <p> C.W.E.<sup><a href="#syr.00023_n8" id="r5">5</a></sup> and I were intensely amused at your "amiable clerk with a pen behind his
      ear," as applied to Stedman's book.<sup><a href="#syr.00023_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> The hit is palpable,
      like Hamlet's lunge. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I am glad I sent you Nencioni's article.<sup><a href="#syr.00023_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup> We are after
      it, hot foot, for I judge that  it must be fine. I made an effort to get it here, but could not
      find, however, where in Italy the <u>Nuova Antologia</u> is
      published, though probably it is Florence or Milan. Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      promises to help find the <u>locale</u>. 
   </p>
   
   <p> It pleases me greatly to hear that your eyes are all right, or nearly so. Do take
      care of them, and beware of draughts—so grateful, but so pernicious. Dr.
      Bigelow, our greatest physician in Boston of old time,<sup><a href="#syr.00023_n5" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      used to say that the back of the neck was more vulnerable than the heel of Achilles,
      when exposed to a draught, and he always put up his coat collar when he got into an
      omnibus or horse-car. 
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p> I heard yesterday that John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r10">10</a></sup> is coming down here. I
      shall be glad to see him, though I owe him a grudge for his late proposition to
      murder all the sparrows. This gives points to Herod, and is worse than the slaughter
      of the innocents, because they were Jew babies and had objectionable little hook
      noses. 
   </p>
   
   <p> The winter has been infernal here since January, and March is not much better. I
      hope the Spring, just beginning to open, may put new life into you. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Glad to hear of the English "offering," which I wish was much more.<sup><a href="#loc.02186_n1" id="r11">11</a></sup> I wish we could get up a boom on your books. That McKay
      is a poor publisher. 
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p> Wonders will never cease, and after all <u>Houghton</u> consented
      to publish my little work "Hamlet's Note-Book," a copy of which I hope to send you
      in a few days.<sup><a href="#syr.00023_n6" id="r12">12</a></sup> Everyone else refused it. The prejudice
      against the Baconians is amazing. The last publisher to whom I offered it (Coombes,
      of New York) although I proposed to pay the cost of manufacture, wrote in reply that
      he would undertake it, push it with energy, and do everything for it in his power,
      if I would only consent that his imprint should not appear on the title page!!! I
      never answered his letter. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Write when you feel like  it, and let me know if anything happens.<sup><a href="#syr.00023_n7" id="r13">13</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="syr.00023_n8">5. Charles W. Eldridge
      (1837–1903) was, with William Wilde Thayer, the Boston publisher of
      Whitman's 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He moved to
      Washington, D.C. during the Civil War and became a good friend of O'Connor. For
      more on Whitman's relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge

   <p id="syr.00023_n3">6. O'Connor is quoting

      Stedman (1833–1908) was an editor, poet, and broker. O'Connor had sent

         </a></p>
   <p id="syr.00023_n4">7. Enrico Nencioni
      (1837–1896) was a poet, critic and translator from Italy. He had published
      a number of essays on Whitman in <em>Fanfulla della Domenica</em>
      in the late 1870s and early 1880s; his "Walt Whitman" appeared in <em>Nuova Antologia</em> in August 1885. See also Roger
      Asselineau, "Whitman in Italy," in <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/pdf/anc.01049.pdf">Walt Whitman and the World</a></em>, ed. Gay Wilson Allen, Ed Folsom

         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">8. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="syr.00023_n5">9. Perhaps a reference to Henry
      Jacob Bigelow (1818–1890), an American surgeon, professor at Harvard and
      one of the leading physicians in Boston (his home town).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">10. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02186_n1">11. See Whitman's letter of . Herbert Gilchrist and William
      Michael Rossetti had been collecting funds in England for the financial support
      of the aged poet. A paragraph in the <em>Athenaeum</em> of July
      11, 1885, read: "A subscription list is being formed in England with a view to
      presenting a free-will offering to the American poet Walt Whitman. The poet is
      in his sixty-seventh year, and has since his enforced retirement some years ago
      from official work in Washington, owing to an attack of paralysis, maintained
      himself precariously by the sale of his works in poetry and prose, and by
      occasional contributions to magazines." <a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="syr.00023_n6">12. O'Connor understood this
      book as a "Baconian reply to R. G. White," a literary critic and scholar, who
      argued that Shakespeare was not a pseudonym of Francis Bacon but indeed a
      distinct historic figure and author. After numerous publishers had declined
      O'Connor's manuscript, it was finally published in 1886 by Houghton, Mifflin and
      Company (Boston and New York). See also O'Connor's letter to Whitman of .<a href="#r12">[back]
