      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sirs
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of 20th 
      rec'd, 
      ab't
      
       Dr Bucke's book. I know something about it, &amp; do not
      object. Dr B. has spent considerable on the illustrations (I have seen them, they
      are quite creditable) has gathered a variety of biographical
      information—criticises my poems from an almost passionately friendly point of
      view (as scientist, student of poetry, medical doctor &amp;c)—&amp; has
      included what as time goes on may prove a curiously valuable collection of
      cumulative opinions on L of G. from 1856 to the present day—&amp; I should say
      it would be a safe publication-enterprise—but you must of course judge &amp;
      decide for yourselves<sup><a href="#upa.00203_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Another thing I must broach—hoping you are not alarmed at the District Attorney
      episode, (as I am not at all,) but see your way clear to continue on in
      earnest—
   </p> 
   
   <p>I have about got into shape a volume (<em>It</em> at least will not be
      liable to any District 
      Att'y
      
       episodes—) comprising all my <em>prose writings</em> to be called (probably)
   </p>
   <em>Specimen Days</em>
   <br><em>&amp; Thoughts</em>
   <br>by Walt Whitman
   
   <p>to be about same size as L of G. This little 
      Dist.
      
       
      Att'y
      
       flurry blowing over, &amp;
      we getting things into good shape—(as of course I suppose <em>it</em> surely will,
      &amp; <em>we</em> will)—would you bring it out say late this summer, same terms as L of
      G? In that case there would be three Volumes gyrating together, the L of G—the
      S D &amp; T—and Dr Bucke's book—
   </p>
   
   <p>Upon the whole, &amp; as my friend seems determined to bring out his book, I hope you
      will take it. I know Dr Bucke well, &amp; have for some years—He is a
      perfectly honorable, reliable solid man to deal with—a linguist, well
      conversant with the best German, French &amp; British poetry—of English stock
      &amp; birth, but grown up in Canada and the California regions of America, &amp;
      combining in my opinion the best traits of both nationalities. He is now &amp; has
      been for some years, (in fact he built up &amp; organized it) at the head of the
      largest &amp; most complete &amp; modernized Asylum for the Insane in
      America—(one of the largest in the world—1000 persons under his
      charge)—near London, Ontario, Canada—Though enthusiastic he has a
      careful eye to practical &amp; business responsibilities—has a fine very large
      family of children—his social, professional, citizen &amp;c reputation, all
      first class in Canada.

   <p id="upa.00203_n1">1. On , Osgood &amp; Co. wrote about Bucke's
      biography: "We do not know whether the book would appeal to us commercially but
      we of course prefer not to look at it without first being sure that it meets
      your approval."<a href="#r1">[back]
