   <p>Mother, I am over at the office—feel rather slim to-day—but the weather is so

      begun—I like to hear all about its progress—

   <p>I see in the papers this morning an awful shipwreck yesterday night<sup><a href="#tex.00339_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup>—seems to me the worst ever happened, a first-class, big
      steamship from England, went down almost instantly, 700 people lost, largely women

      children, just as they got here, (towards Halifax)—what misery, to many thousand
      relatives &amp; friends—Mother, I send you the Graphic—the pictures are
      amusing<sup><a href="#tex.00339_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup>—(I thought I would write a line to the
      Townsends<sup><a href="#n0647" id="r8">8</a></sup>, mostly on Aunt Sally's account, as it may humour her)—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00339_n1">2. Lillie Townsend was, like Priscilla
      Townsend (see Whitman's  letter to
      his mother), presumably a cousin of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0747">3. Sarah "Sally" Mead was the aunt of
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) and Walt Whitman's maternal
      grandmother's sister. By 1873, Mead was more than 90 years old.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00339_n2">4. Walt Whitman was understandably confused
      about the relationship. Sarah Mead and Phebe Pintard were sisters (born
      Williams) and his maternal grandmother's sisters. Mead was at the time over
      ninety years old, but Pintard had been dead for several years. See Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman of April 3, 1873, and Walt Whitman's
      jottings dated November 20, 1873 (The Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke
      University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0700">5. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00339_n3">6. The first reports of the sinking of the
      steamship <em>Atlantic</em> spoke of the loss of 700 lives. On
      April 3, 1873, the New York <em>Times</em> noted that the number
      was 546. Later a board of inquiry attributed the disaster to dereliction of duty
      on the part of the captain.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00339_n4">7. The New York <em>Daily
         Graphic</em> took pride in its illustrations of topical happenings.<br><br>
      The New York <em>Daily Graphic</em> published a number of Walt
      Whitman's poems and prose pieces in 1873 and 1874. In the former year the
      <em>Daily Graphic</em> printed the following works: "Nay,
      Tell Me Not To-day the Publish'd Shame" on ; "With All the Gifts, America" on ; "The Singing Thrush" (later titled "Wandering at
      Morn") on ; "Spain" on ; "Sea Captains, Young or Old"
      (later called "Song for All Seas, All Ships") on ; "Warble for Lilac-Time" on May 12, 1873; "Halls of
      Gold and Lilac" on November 24, 1873; and "Silver and Salmon-Tint" on
      November 29, 1873. In 1874, the <em>Daily Graphic</em> printed
      "A Kiss to the Bride" on ; "Song
      of the Universal" on ; and "An
      Old Man's Thought of School" on .
