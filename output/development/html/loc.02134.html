      interested in the prospect and hoped the results would be satisfactory. I speak in
      Philadelphia in the evening but that will not interfere with my attendance at the
      dinner. I hope Mr. Howells<sup><a href="#n4317" id="r5">5</a></sup> can go down.<sup><a href="#loc.02134_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Hamlin Garland
      (1860–1940) was an American novelist and autobiographer, known especially
      for his works about the hardships of farm life in the American Midwest. For his
      relationship to Whitman, see Thomas K. Dean, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_190.html">Garland, Hamlin</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.02134_n2">2. Garland attended Whitman's
      birthday celebration, which took place at Morgan's Hall in Camden, N.J., on May
      31. He gave a brief address on Whitman's themes of "Optimism and
      Altruism—Hope for the future and Sympathy toward men."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n3039">3. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="loc.02136_n3">4. Hezekiah Butterworth
      (1839-1905). He was assistant editor (1870-1904) of <em>The
         Youth's Companion</em>, a prominent Boston weekly magazine for children.
      Garland published two poems in <em>The Youth's Companion</em> in
      1889: "A Dakota Wheat Field," which appeared in the July 18 issue, and "By the
      River," which appeared in the August 15 number.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n4317">5. William Dean Howells
      (1837–1920) was an American realist novelist and literary critic, serving
      the staff of the <em>New York Nation</em> and <em>Harper's Magazine</em> during the mid 1860s. During his tenure as
      editor-in-chief of <em> The Atlantic Monthly</em> from 1871 to
      1880, he was one of the foremost critics in New York, and used his influence to
      support American authors like Hamlin Garland, Stephen Crane, and Emily
      Dickinson. He also brought attention to European authors like Henrik Ibsen,
      Giovanni Verga, and Leo Tolstoy in particular. Howells was highly skeptical of
      Whitman's poetry, however, and frequently questioned his literary merit. In an
      Ashtabula <em> Sentinel </em>review of the 1860 edition <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, Howells wrote, "If he is indeed 'the
      distinctive poet of America,' then the office of poet is one which must be left
      hereafter to the shameless and the friendless. for WALT WHITMAN is not a man
      whom you would like to know." In 1865, Howells would write the first important
      review of <em> Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Round
         Table</em>, demonstrating early signs of his conflicted opinion about
      Whitman. For more information on Howells, see Goodman, Susan &amp; Dawson, Carl,
      <em>William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life</em> (Berkeley:
      University of California Press, 2005).<a href="#r5">[back]
