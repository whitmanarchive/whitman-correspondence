   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am sitting here in my little front room down stairs writing this—a good fire
      in the stove—It is cold &amp; cloudy outside, &amp; the day is drawing to a
      close—Two visitors from 
      Phila:
      
       have been to see me—two youngish middle-aged ladies, one an artist
      &amp; the other[—]I knew her years ago in Washington—Marie Le Baron
      then[—]a writer—the latter married to her second husband, (the first one dead)—now
      Mrs:
      Urie, a little bit of a body, but a great talker full of life &amp; good sense
      &amp; good nature (like the best goods done up in small parcels)—I have not been out all
      day—wish I could just come in &amp; spend the evening
      &amp; take supper with you all.—If it is 
      any thing
      
       like fair weather next Sunday, shall be down 
      ab't
      
       the usual time—but if it is stormy or very cold, don't look for
      me—Ed, I gave your gloves to Billy,<sup><a href="#loc.03920_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> ten days ago
      to take to you, so I suppose you have them long before this—Went to dinner New
      Years to Dr. Shivers,<sup><a href="#loc.03920_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—had a first rate time—
       &amp; Sunday to Col
      &amp; Mrs. Scovel's also to dinner—Have not heard 
      any thing
      
       further from Herbert—Often think of Mrs. Gilchrist—(I have a
      good photo. of her)—Do you remember that day—last of May '77 I
      think—she &amp; her two daughters came down to see us, &amp; me down at the
      pond, under the old oak tree?<sup><a href="#loc.03920_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Ah that old pond
      &amp; the banks, &amp; the old lane—I shall never forget them—Shall
      never forget you &amp; George, &amp; all of you, either—Love to you all, &amp;
      God bless you—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).
