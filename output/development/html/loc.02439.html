      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Last evening Mr Wallace<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r1">1</a></sup> shewed me your post card, from which I
      was extremely sorry to learn that you had been a little uneasy about me. By this
      time you will know from his cablegram and from our letters that all is well with me
      but I regret that I did not write to you sooner or cable to you immediately upon my
      arrival, through not doing so I feel I have been guilty of a seeming lack of
      courtesy to you. <u>You</u> will need no assurance that this has
      not been intentional on
      my part; for I can never forget your great kindness to me—the homely, cordial
      + sponteneous reception you gave me not only to your house but into your heart which
      you seemed fairly to open to me in a way that has touched me very deeply indeed.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>By your loving kindness, your sympathy and your open-handed generosity you have
      enriched my life with treasures which I would not exchange for all the wealth of
      Golconda for you have given me "<u>yourself</u>" as "a living
      impulse"
   </p>
   
   <p>"We convince by our presence." Your presence has haunted me ever since I left you
      and
      at times the sense of propinquity is so strong that I find it difficult to realize
      that we are separated by more than three thousand miles!
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>"What is it then between us? Whatever it is it avails not,—distance avails not,
      and place avails not."
   </p>
   
   <p>The words of Mr Wallace that I seem to have had a spiritual [illegible] are no exaggeration for I am conscious of having
      received a <u>something</u> from you which has infused itself
      into my being and which eludes my senses and baffles my judgment to explain.
   </p>
   
   <p>And now you crown your goodness by shewing such a sympathetic concern about my
      welfare as no other man save my own, dear, good father could have done.
   </p>
   
   <p>For all this and more I desire you to accept of my heartfelt thanks.</p>
   
   
   <p>I am glad to hear that your health is fairly good + I trust it may continue to
      improve now that the intensly hot weather has gone.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am taking the liberty of writing to Dr Bucke to explain my not visiting him as I
      intended. It was simply impossible for me to do so + deeply do I now regret it.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope Warren has received the book on "massage."</p>
   
   <p>I send you a few photographs—the first I have done + hope you will like
      them.
   </p>
   
   <p>With kindest regards to M<u>rs</u> Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r2">2</a></sup> +
      Warren + love to yourself
   </p>
   
   <p>[illegible]</p>
