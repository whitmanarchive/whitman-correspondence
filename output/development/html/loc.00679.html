   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have &amp; still suffer so much agony I am like a child I have longed so for a
      letter I have seen one to Charles with a few lines to me If I
      could see one of my own [
      <span class="unclear">folks?</span>]
       I see in
      that letter that you wrote of 
      comeing
      
       I suppose dear brother that is asking too much. I 
      dont
      
       suffer now, only my hand, the fever is gone my head is clear my mind has
      not wandered only when I [
      <span class="unclear">dozed?</span>]
       I
      sometimes think you have written. I have been [
      <span class="unclear">
         truharted
         
         ?</span>]
       or refused so many things I did not like to tell mother but
      first Charlie was very ugly he would not get a nurse. dear brother I find I am 
      to
      
       weak to write. Dr Thayer  I believe thinks all my thumb 
      wont
      
       get well I feel very [
      <span class="unclear">anxious?</span>]
      
      about it. dear brother write to Dr [
      <span class="unclear">Samuel?</span>]
      
      
      B
      
       Thayer. &amp; thank him first Charlie refused to
      let me go for him. Saturday Nov 14. Dear brother I suffered dreadfully
      last night with my hand the Doctor did not come in yesterday I was [
      <span class="unclear">greatly?</span>]
       frightened about my hand &amp; Charlie
      scolded me till I thought I should be thrown in a fever again I make very <u>much</u> trouble but I suffer too terribly to be scolded. I
      think I shall get well if I 
      dont
      
       get fever but will suffer much my hand is much more painful you know I 
      cant
      
       even be roused in bed on account of
       raising my hand 
      its
      
       hard to write Charlie last night brought me your letter to him I read it
      many times 
      its
      
       strange he did not tell you
      how I asked so much for letter, you speak dear brother of knowing constantly about
      my illness. I know that Charlie wrote many times [
      <span class="unclear">mornings?</span>]
       without 
      comeing
      
       in to see what kind of a night I had passed my strength fails. I 
      cant
      
       say much but Charlie was kind to 
      [
      <span class="unclear">about?</span>]
      
      
       about 2 or 3 days then after doctor scolded him if I am to be sick much longer I do so want one
      of my own that belongs to me &amp; 
      
      <p>be pleasant to Charlie while I am</p>
      
      <p>sick on my account</p>
      
      <p>Ellen is very good to me</p>
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>feels interested if I only could I 
      dont
      
       suppose Mother being sick &amp; our Mother could come and I am afraid it
      would be too hard for her I will ask 
      [
      <span class="unclear">fr?</span>]
      
      
       how long before I can get just a little relief from pain if he ever comes
      Charlie has gone for him I want you to write to him I have often spoken of you let
      [illegible] brother of all things in I beg you to not let
      Charlie know I have wrote to you. I run a great 
      risk risk
      
      . Write to me, at once perhaps [
      <span class="unclear">Me?</span>]
       be better soon

      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt
