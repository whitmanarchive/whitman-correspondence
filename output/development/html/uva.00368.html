      <br></br><br></br>John &amp; Ursula BurroughsDear friends,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thank you for the kind reminder that <em>room &amp; breakfast plate are
         ready</em>— I shall be coming along—will send you word when— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have hardly any thing to tell about my improvement in health—it is certain I
      do not get really worse—&amp; yet lameness &amp; pretty bad
      headspells—added to which lately a great deal of pain &amp; oppression in left
      side—keep me back. John, I sympathise with you in that jolly bother among the
      bees &amp; the ground, &amp; birds, nag, &amp;c. Such homely ties—&amp; to
      come in real contact— &amp; have to do with them— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The piece I thought might amuse you in the Galaxy is "Our Neighborhood" by Lady
      Blanche Murphy.<sup><a href="#uva.00368_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>John, I enclose a slip about Carlyle, the latest
      news—seems to be authentic— 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondents:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<br>Ursula North Burroughs
      (1836–1917) was John Burroughs's wife. Ursula and John were married on
      September 12, 1857. The couple maintained a small farm overlooking the Hudson
      River in West Park, Ulster County. They adopted a son, Julian, at two months of
      age. It was only later revealed that John himself was the biological father of
      Julian.<br></p>
