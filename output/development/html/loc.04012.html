   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of 20th rec'd this morning &amp; is quite a surprise to me, &amp; a little <u>not understandable</u><sup><a href="#loc.04012_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—But
      you will tell me plainer when you come up &amp; see me Saturday—Don't do any
      thing too hastily, &amp; from great excitement—I shall look for you
      Saturday—If any thing prevents your coming, write me &amp; write fully.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am much the same—rather easier if any thing the past two weeks—but the
      bad pall-weight &amp; inertia, (like a sluggish, sleepy, tired, great weight, as of
      heavy irons on me, body &amp; spirit) seem to be on me all the time—&amp;
      appear destined for life. Still keep the sick chair &amp; sick room—(now going
      into the sixth month)—The big book <sup><a href="#n6157" id="r2">2</a></sup>, (my whole works in one Vol.) will be bound
      now in a week or ten days—I suppose Eva<sup><a href="#n6107" id="r3">3</a></sup> bro't you the
      little <u>Nov: Boughs</u><sup><a href="#n3999" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Things go on
      comfortably with me—Eat &amp; sleep fairly—spirits good yet—Sunny
      cold weather here—Herbert<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r5">5</a></sup> comes quite often—Two
      visitors ladies strangers just here to see me—love to you, dear boy, &amp; to
      Eva and Dora<sup><a href="#n6119" id="r6">6</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
