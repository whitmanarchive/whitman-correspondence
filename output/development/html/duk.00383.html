   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

   <p id="duk.00383_n2">1. The date of this
      fragment can only be conjectural. In 1866, George was in business with
      Smith. According to his mother's letter of June 7, 1866, to Walt Whitman,
      "George and smith and french the mason has bought 5 lots on portland ave
      opposite the arsenal, 950 a lot, going to put up brick houses" (Trent
      Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and
      Special Collections Library). On October 10, she wrote: "george says if you
      will buy smiths half of that lot he will fix the shop (the carpenters shop
      acrost the street) for me . . . for about 1200 twelv hundred dollars" (Trent
      Collection).<br><br>Only the lower half of the letter is extant.<a href="#r1">[back]
