   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n3039">2. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

   <p id="n4983">3. David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n4188">4. Whitman often referred to <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888) as his "big book." With
      the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made the presswork and binding decisions,
      and Frederick Oldach bound the volume, which included a profile photo of the
      poet on the title page. Philadelphia publisher David McKay published the book in
      December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n0625">5. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.07716_n2">6. "Throstle" was a parody of
      Tennyson by the English poet and author Edmund Gosse (1849–1928). Whitman

   <p id="n4273">9. Jessie Maria Gurd (1839–1926)
      grew up in Mooretown, Upper Canada. She was the daughter of William Gurd, an 
      army officer from Ireland. Jessie married Richard Maurice Bucke in 1865. The couple
      had eight children.<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="loc.07330_n2">10. Dr. Beemer was in charge of
      the "Refractory Building" at Bucke's asylum. Whitman met Beemer during his visit
      there in the summer of 1880. See James H. Coyne, <em>Richard
         Maurice Bucke: A Sketch</em> (Toronto: Transactions of the Royal Society of
      Canada, 1906), 52.<a href="#r10">[back]

   <p id="loc.07319_n6">11. Frank Warren Fritzinger
      (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
      nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
      of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a blind sea captain, and
      Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and his
      brother–having lost both parents–became wards of Mary O. Davis,
      Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
      inherited part of his estate. <a href="#r11">[back]
