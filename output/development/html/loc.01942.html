   <p>If you will reply to this I shall be satisfied; and where one is so easily made
      happy—will you grudge a little inconvenience?

   <p>You are well known here and much talked of—and we are looking for a fresh edition
      of your poems. How long must we wait?

   <p>I am approaching my 
      twenty-fourth birthday—and stand upon the order of printing a small selection of
      my own rhymes—being assisted in this (perhaps unwise move) by my friends. May I
      send you a copy of my book in June?—when it will be safely out. D. V.

   <p>Please answer me—if possible, and be sure—if you so far honor me—I shall thank

   <h4 class="indent">MY FRIEND</h4>
   <p>
      I have a friend who is so true to me,
      <br><span class="indent2">We may not parted be.</span>
      <br><br>
      Though I strayed, on to the uttermost,
      <br><span class="indent2">Yet is his voice not lost.</span>
      <br><br>
      If I am madly-deaf for having erred,
      <br><span class="indent2">Still may I hear his word.</span>
      <br><br>
      If sin hath slain mine honor, straight appears,
      <br><span class="indent2">The river of his tears,</span>
      <br><br>
      Wherein I find redemption: tenderly
      <br><span class="indent2">He woos my fear away,</span>
      <br><br>
      And searches out some star of hope, above,
      <br><span class="indent2">So boundless in his love.</span>
      <br><br>
      When from the loathed grave I shall arise,
      <br><span class="indent2">He'll hail me from the skies.</span>
      <br><br>
      Who else would seek me in corruption's dress
      <br><span class="indent2">With a so kind caress?</span>
      <br><br>
      Though I am weak, there is a hope of power;
      <br><span class="indent2">He is my mighty tower;</span>
      <br><br>
      Like as a flame to fright the gloom away;
      <br><span class="indent2">He is my perfect day.</span>
      <br><br>
      I am the homely bulb that tops the reed—
      <br><span class="indent2">He is the precious seed.</span>
      <br><br>
      I am the rudest shell the vext-waves whirl—
      <br><span class="indent2">He is the priceless pearl.</span>
      <br><br>
      <em>Thou art indeed my friend while ages roll,</em>
      <br><span class="indent2">O! thou my deathless soul.</span>

   </p>
   
   
   
   <br><h4 class="indent">AT ANCHOR.</h4>
   <p>
      A sailor by the green home-shore,
      <br><span class="indent2">While seas are ebbing from his view,</span>
      <br><span class="indent2">Doth all his earthly joys renew:</span>
      <br>He sings the songs he sang of yore;
      <br><br>
      He spies his little cot, he smiles
      <br><span class="indent2">With a full joy ne'er felt before—</span>
      <br><span class="indent2">He holds that one bare prospect more</span>
      <br>Than all the summer of the isles.
      <br><br>
      The quiet home is his; the trees
      <br><span class="indent2">Sprang from the seeds his grandsires laid,</span>
      <br><span class="indent2">Among the mould; within the glade</span>
      <br>The myrtles rustle in the breeze.
      <br><br>
      Above a treasured little grave,
      <br><span class="indent2">His earthly lost, his first deep woe!</span>
      <br><span class="indent2">Not any land that he may know</span>
      <br>Beyond the purple of the wave
      <br><br>
      Hath such a jewel in its breast.
      <br><span class="indent2">He loves each rock and stream and dell;</span>
      <br><span class="indent2">'Tis only here he cares to dwell,</span>
      <br>'Tis ever here he longs to rest.
      <br><br>
      This is his home of joy and ease:
      <br><span class="indent2">And better is the myrtle tomb</span>
      <br><span class="indent2">Than all the heavy dusks that gloom</span>
      <br>The groves of spice beyond the seas.

   <br><h4 class="indent">AT THE SPRING.</h4>
   <p>
      
      <span class="indent2">I knew a cumbrous hill,</span>
      <br>From whose green breast did daintily distill
      <br><span class="indent2">A throbbing rill.</span>
      <br><br>
      
      <span class="indent2">This is the artery,</span>
      <br>And further on the crystal heart must be,
      <br><span class="indent2">Thought said to me.</span>
      <br><br>
      
      <span class="indent2">All other I forsook,</span>
      <br>To follow every twist and curious crook
      <br><span class="indent2">Of this wild brook.</span>
      <br><br>
      
      <span class="indent2">Among deep mosses set,</span>
      <br>I found the glimmering fount that did beget
      <br><span class="indent2">The rivulet.</span>
      <br><br>
      
      <span class="indent2">No other eye had known</span>
      <br>Its secret, nor ear heard—for it made moan
      <br><span class="indent2">Always alone.</span>
      <br><br>
      
      <span class="indent2">I quaffed its water clear;</span>
      <br>Its limpid music babbled to mine ear
      <br><span class="indent2">With voice sincere.</span>
      <br><br>
      
      <span class="indent2">Then such a silence fell</span>
      <br>Upon me, mantling me, as where a spell
      <br><span class="indent2">Is wont to dwell.</span>
      <br><br>
      
      <span class="indent2">Yet fled I from the place</span>
      <br>At a rude rustling; and fear gave me chase
      <br><span class="indent2">In my disgrace.</span>
      <br><br>
      
      <span class="indent2">'Twas a slim water-snake</span>
      <br>Slipt like an arrow through the shivering brake.
      <br><span class="indent2">And left no wake.</span>
      <br><br>
      
      <span class="indent2">But cleft the placid spring</span>
      <br>And waved its flaming sword, its forked sting,
      <br><span class="indent2">In a charmed ring.</span>
      <br><br>
      <br>
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
      <br><br>
      <br>
      
      <span class="indent2">So was the fountain spoiled</span>
      <br>Within its lucid walls a devil coiled—
      <br><span class="indent2">My trust was foiled.</span>

   <br><h4 class="indent">THE SECRET WELL</h4>
   <p>
      I know a well so deep and cool
      <br>And hid, the crystal-hearted pool
      <br>Hath never thrilled a swallow's throat
      <br><span class="indent2">Or sweetened a lark's note.</span>
      <br><br>
      No fainting stag, though perishing,
      <br>Hath ventured to disturb this spring;
      <br>No leopard with its fiery breast
      <br><span class="indent2">This fountain dares molest.</span>
      <br><br>
      No cunning silver-cased trout
      <br>The sheltered source can e'er search out—
      <br>No tongue but mine may ever tell
      <br><span class="indent2">The secret of this well.</span>
      <br><br>
      I build about its guarded rim
      <br>With added stones: I know the dim
      <br>Still twilight of its mossy cell,
      <br><span class="indent2">Where the sweet waters dwell.</span>
      <br><br>
      For spirits go between us two
      <br>With flasks; they brim with softest dew.
      <br>I drink and am refreshed and seem
      <br><span class="indent2">As living in a dream.</span>
      <br><br>
      This well, that is alone for me,
      <br>Is all a fount of memory;
      <br>And every year that I have known
      <br><span class="indent2">Is as an added stone.</span>
      <br><br>
      My willing thoughts, as spirits, haste
      <br>To draw the draught I love to taste.
      <br>There is an ever full supply
      <br><span class="indent2">Yet who may drink but I?</span>

   <br><h4 class="indent">A RHYME OF LIFE.</h4>
   <p>
      If life be as a flame that death doth kill:
      <br>Burn little candle lit for me.
      <br>With a pure spark, that I may rightly see
      <br>To word my song and utterly
      <br><span class="indent2">God's plan fulfill.</span>
      <br><br>
      If life be as a flower that blooms and dies:
      <br>Forbid the cunning frost that slays
      <br>With Judas-kiss, and trusting love betrays:
      <br>Forever may my song of praise
      <br><span class="indent2">Untainted rise</span>
      <br><br>
      If life be as a voyage, or foul, or fair:
      <br>Oh! bid me not my banners furl
      <br>For adverse gale, or wave in angry whirl,
      <br>Till I have found the gates of pearl
      <br><span class="indent2">And anchored there.</span>

   </p>
   
   
   
   <br><h4 class="indent">Cherries and Grapes.</h4>
   <p>
      Not the cherries' nerveless flesh,
      <br>However fair, however fresh,
      <br>May ever hope my love to win
      <br>For Ethiope blood and satin skin.
      <br><br>
      Their lustre rich, and deep their dye,
      <br>Yet under all their splendors lie—
      <br>To what I cannot tribute grant—
      <br>Their hateful hearts of adamant.
      <br><br>
      I love the amber globes that hold
      <br>That dead-delicious wine of gold;
      <br>A thousand torrid suns distill
      <br>Such liquors as those flagons fill.
      <br><br>
      Yet tropic gales with souls of musk
      <br>Should steep my grapes in steams of dusk;
      <br>An orient Eden nothing lacks
      <br>To spice their purple silken sacks.

   <br><h4 class="indent">MADRIGAL.</h4>
   <p>
      A maid is sitting by a brook,
      <br>The sweetest of sweet creatures:
      <br>I pass that way with my good book
      <br>Yet cannot read, nor cease to look
      <br><span class="indent2">Upon her winsome features.</span>
      <br><br>
      Amongst the blushes on her cheek
      <br>Her small, white hand reposes:
      <br>I am a shepherd, for I seek
      <br>That wilful lamb, with fleece so sleek,
      <br><span class="indent2">Feeding among the roses!</span>
