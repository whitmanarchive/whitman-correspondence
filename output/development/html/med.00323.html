      <br xmlns="" class="opener">July 2, 1864.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your note of June 25th did not reach me till the 28th. Since then another word has
      come from you to Charles Eldridge.
   </p>  
   
   <p>I was very glad to hear from you and am quite vexed with myself that I did not answer
      the note at once, as I meant to do. Procrastination seems to possess me of late years.
      I think it must be in the Washington air, together with other vices.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am very much encouraged at the prospects of your recovery. I never can say how anxious
      I was about you when you were here. It was so lucky that you left just when you did,
      for the three or four days succeeding your departure were fearful for dead heat and
      I don't know how you could have borne them.
   </p>
   
   <p>Many thoughts of you have come to me since you went away, and sometimes it has been
      lonely and a little like death. Particularly at evening when you used to come in.
   </p>
   
   <p>But, on the whole, every feeling submerges in gratefulness and thankfulness that you
      were away from this great sultriness and where you can have the rest and help it was
      not our fortune to be able to give you here.
   </p>
   
   <p>I do not attempt to write you a letter this time, but only a note or noteling by way
      of proof that I exist and do not forget you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Everything here is much as it was. Nelly is not yet gone, but probably goes next week.
      She will write to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I wonder what the future for us is to be. Shall we triumph over obscurities and obstacles
      and emerge to start the Pathfinder, or whatever the name of it is to be? I wonder
      if it is so written on the iron leaf. Shall you live to publish many great poems amidst
      recognition and tumults of applause? Shall I live to write my Shakespeare book and
      a score of gorgeous romances? Or shall we never meet, never work together, never start
      any Pathfinder, never do anything but fade out into death, frustrated, lost in oblivion?—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <span class="indent">"All the dawns promised shall the day fulfill,</span><br>
   <span class="indent">The glory and the grandeur of each dream,</span><br>
   <span class="indent">And every prophecy shall come to pass</span><br>
   <span class="indent">And all hope be accomplished."</span><br>
   <br><br>
   
   
   
   
   <p>So says Master Robert Browning and so it may be.</p>
   
   <p>At all events I hope you will get well very soon and make preparations for eternity
      by publishing your Drum-Taps.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hardly believe you will come back here. But I hope you will. That is, when the weather
      gets decent. Do go to the seashore if you can. I wish I could. O the rough green of
      the illumined surges! O the briny odor! Thalatta! Thalatta! It revives me even in
      this sweltering air just to think of it.
   </p>
   
   <p>I will now stop writing and send this miserable and wilted letter-a better than which
      I will write next time.
   </p>
   
   <p>Rely on me, Walt, for anything you want done here, or anything at all in my power.</p>

      With much love, your faithful
      <br></br>W. D. O'Connor.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
      John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
      years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an intelligent man who
      deserved something better than the various governmental clerical posts he was to
      hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship, however, was relieved by the
      presence of Whitman whom he was to love and venerate—and defend with a
      single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of vituperation and eulogy that have
      seldom been equaled, most notably in his pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was
      the first, and in many ways the most important, of the adulators who divided
      people arbitrarily into two categories: those who were for and those who were
      against Walt Whitman. The poet praised O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous
      collection of his tales: "He was a born sample here in the 19th century of the
      flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his
      memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton,
      1910] pp. 513). For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>. Of the O'Connors, Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman wrote on : "I am
      real glad, my dear Walt, that you are among such good people. I hope it will be
      in the power of some of our family to return their kindness some day. I'm sure
      twould be done with a heartfelt gratitude. Tis pleasant, too, to think, that
      there are still people of that kind left."
