   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00024_n1">1. William Conant Church
      (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
      York newspapers until he founded the <em>Army and Navy
         Journal</em> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
      he established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. Financial control of
      the <em>Galaxy</em> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
      was absorbed by the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1878. William
      published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
      Francis wrote for the New York <em>Sun</em> the unsigned piece
      "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." See Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the
      <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952),

      George Peabody (1795–1869), merchant and philanthropist, died in London
      on November 4, 1869, and his body was returned to Danvers, Massachusetts in
      January, 1870. He founded and endowed the Peabody museums at Yale and
      Harvard. The poem, entitled "Outlines for a Tomb (G. P., Buried 1870)" in
      the 1881 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, appeared in the
      <em>Galaxy</em>, 9 (January 1870), 75–76.<br><br>
