      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Returning from Germany I found your letter of 25 Jan.
      waiting for me with many others. My first task was to write to you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>'Democratic Vistas' has appeared in Danish translation for two
      weeks ago. I sent you myself one copy in loose sheets (to [
      <span class="unclear">say those?</span>]
       small parcels) and
      the editor has during my absence on the day of the appearance sent you two complete
      copies—one of them <u>unpaid</u>, that it could be [
      <span class="unclear">sooner?</span>]
       to reach you. In
      "[
      <span class="unclear">Illustrent
         Fodelandet?</span>]
      " (the people's illustrated magazine) for 22 Feb your
      likeness with a short biographical notice has been published, and the editor has
      sent you some copies. Of course all these parcels have gone to the Solicitor's
      office in Washington. I hope, that nevertheless the most
      of them have reached you. If not, let me know it as soon as possible, and new copies
      shall then be forwarded.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Fædrelandet" (the fatherland) brings this evening a criticism on eight columns
      on your book. You shall have the paper sent one of these days. "Fædrelandet"
      was [
      <span class="unclear">during?</span>]
       30 years
      [
      <span class="unclear">our?</span>]
      
       most influential
      paper, the sovereign commander of opinions. At present its luster blackens and
      darkens. From democratic and liberal it has grown conservative and anxious. As all
      what is calling itself "intellect" in Denmark the editor
      does not at all understand the democratic movement among the peasantry. Your book
      has been as a clenched fist in the eyes of all these people. Of course the criticism
      testifies the fact. But the <u>eight</u> columns are in the eyes
      of the Danish public a great honour. The author of the criticism Rosenberg is a
      silly little fellow, who understands nothing between heaven and earth, and least of
      all, you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Clemens Petersen was in ten
      years the critic of "Fædrelandet." It has been told to me, that his essay in
      the Atlantic Monthly has had a great "success" in America. I can hardly believe it.
      It is true. It should interest me <u>very much</u> to have true
      information on this point. My own opinion I wrote you in a letter the last summer.
      I
      hope, that you have received it. I also one time sent you a choice of Norwegian and
      Swedish poems in English translation, have you received it? With poor Clausen I sent you my picture. If you have not got, then [
      <span class="unclear">mail?</span>]
       it from his widow. It
      is the only one, which is resembling.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The several pages which you have sent  me I have duly received. But I did not think, that your illness
      had been so very [
      <span class="unclear">intense?</span>]
      , as now I hear.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In Berlin I saw Bismarck. Is is worth the travel to get a
      glance on this so very 
      powerfull
      
       and so excessively beastly face. Attila called himself "God's scourge",
      Napoleon did not call himself so, but he was it. But Attila
      was [
      <span class="unclear">imposing?</span>]
       in the
      splendour of this barbaric greatness; of Napoleon the German H. Heine has said "every inch a God". A scourge like this Brandenburgian
      fox hunter mankind never has known. Perhaps mankind never has been so deeply
      fallen!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I fully understand your interest for Bjornson. He is genuine, his poetry comes from
      the source that is throbbing in the people's own heat.  He has
      been the spoiled darling of the whole Danish public. But he is a living test of the
      [
      <span class="unclear">
         hidous
         
         ?</span>]
       and venomous serpent, that hides his ugly head among the
      flowers of the '<u>pantheistic</u>' poetry. You have in your
      "vistas" spoken proud words of the flame of conscience, the moral force as the
      greatest lack of the present democracy. You have, without knowing it, named the lack
      of Bjornson at the same time! Bjornson owes Denmark
      <u>gratitude</u>. He has shown it in the form of deep and bloody
       offences, that
      make every honest Danish [
      <span class="unclear">heat?</span>]
      
      [
      <span class="unclear">burn?</span>]
       with rage and
      indignation. I hope never to see this man, whom I have really loved, [
      <span class="unclear">more?</span>]
      . At present he is in
      Italy and most probably he is going to America in the spring to finish his moral putrification with
      dollars–gaining, handshakings and other humbug.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You know too little of our relations, therefore I can tell you no more. But you will
      understand that I can forward no demand from you to Bjornson. But Clemens Petersen was one of his "lovers" and is it still.
      If Bjornson goes to America, he will visit Petersen. To
      <u>him</u> you can write and get said information.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have asked you at least two times how you did like Clemens
      Petersen; you have not replied and most probably you 
      wont
      
       speak of this matter. If that is the case, I shall repeat the question no
      more.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Hoping that these lines will find you in ameliorated state of health I am</p>
