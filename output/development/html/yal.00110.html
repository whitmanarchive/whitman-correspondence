      <br></br>Dear Sirs
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The documents 
      rec'd—but I cannot agree or convey copyright as therein specified. Of
      course you must be thoroughly fortified in your investment &amp; publication of the
      book—&amp; I will do any &amp; every thing to secure you to your fullest
      satisfaction (if not already—which I thought the case—distinctly, amply,
      legally secured by my letters in the correspondence between us <u>ante</u>)—But the copyright of <u>Leaves of Grass</u>
      must remain absolutely &amp; solely in my own hands as hitherto.<sup><a href="#yal.00110_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>The steel engraving—just as good as new I believe—I send herewith. It is
      required in the book (to face page 29)—in fact is involved as part of the
      poem. If desired I will sell it to you, as a necessary part of the stock for issuing
      the book—price $50 cash, &amp; 20 copies of book (without royalty)—I
      shall want 200 prints from the plate also—(the printer can make that number
      extra &amp; give me)<sup><a href="#yal.00110_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The book will make 390 (to '95) pages. Seems to me every way best for us both that
      it 
      sh'd
      
       be put at <u>two dollars</u>—&amp; that it can well be afforded at that
      price.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Before putting in any thing in 
      adv't'mt
      
       or circular advertising L. of G. let me be consulted—Show me
      first.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      Dont
      
       forget carefully attending to the English copyright through
      Trübner—as we concluded about it the other day.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I want to say over again that while I reserve to the fullest degree all my own rights
      &amp; 
      
       the means to
      maintain them, you are to be, &amp; I hereby make &amp; confirm you, the sole
      issuers and publishers of my completed <u>Leaves of
         Grass</u>—that I shall coöperate strenuously &amp; loyally in the
      enterprise—&amp; to add that I do not fix any term or limit of years, because
      it is my wish that the publication by you, on the conditions &amp; payments of
      royalty already settled between us, may, while those conditions are fulfilled,
      continue on and on, quite indefinitely &amp; without limit, as being (I hope) better
      for you, &amp; better for me too.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Should you wish any thing more in detail let me know. Of course any further points,
      specifications &amp;c. that may arise as time elapses, or as circumstances or our
      wishes require, are open to both of us, to be added, modified, revoked or what not,
      as we may join &amp; agree.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00110_n1">1. The firm agreed on the
      following day, , to make the
      changes (<em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New York:
      G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 8:284). The contract was executed on October 1: the
      price of the edition was to be $2, the royalty was twenty-five cents on
      every copy sold, the copyright was to remain in the poet's hands, and Osgood
      &amp; Co. was to be the sole publisher for ten years (The Library of Congress;
      <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>,
      8:285–286).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="yal.00110_n2">2. Osgood &amp; Co. replied
      on  that the plate (the portrait in
      the first edition) was worn, and that it would cost "$15. or $20. to put
      it into a condition suitable to use." Whitman received $40 from the firm on
      September 30 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
