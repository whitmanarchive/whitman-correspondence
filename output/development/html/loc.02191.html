      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Your new book
      "Specimen days" came to hand this
      morning Mother is delighted with 
      it and so am I. How prettily
      you have let the illustrations in,
      artistically done, and what a good
      thing it is to dispense with the
      photographic [
      <span class="unclear">change?</span>]
      . The picture
      of your father is jolly: and of 
      you holding the butterfly is original
      and nice. I like the title page,
      a return to your old style.
      What you say about Millet
      is very, particularly, interesting to me.
      I always wanted you to see Millets
      pictures only I had no idea it ever
      could be managed, he <u>is</u> an artist
      of the first water. But there are
      indications I think that you will
      have a Millet of your own in America.
      The bits about the Creek are
      just delightful to my mind: you
      
      have so impregnated your pages
      with the bumble-bee birds,
      clover &amp; all those lovely things
      at the Creek: I haven't had time to read it all yet.

      I suppose the wood at Glendale
      is developing a charm of its
      own, I liked it very much:
      although of course it is not so
      rich and varied as Kirkwood, the
      Creek certainly was unique, I
      have never seen anything like it.

      Mother is busy over her life
      of Mary Lamb—nearly
      finished. She is well I am
      thankful to say and so is Gracie,
      at this moment she is singing, her
      voice has improved wonderfully.

      I have just returned from
      Haslemere where I have been
      painting a portrait of an old
      fox-hunter, such a John Bull
      in his scarlet coat and blue
      velvet jockey cap, buckskin breeches
      etc: You would smile if saw
      
      it—because James Simmions's
      [
      <span class="unclear">has?</span>]
       one of those characteristic
      faces, wh one at once recognizes
      as friends.
