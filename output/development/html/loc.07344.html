   <p>I have yours of 23<u>d</u><sup><a href="#loc.07344_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> (posted 
      24<u>th</u>) it came to hand last evening, it and also mrs
      Costelloe's<sup><a href="#loc.07344_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> (accompanying it) were heartily welcome. Am glad that you seem to be no
      worse—but what is this about Harry Stafford<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r4">4</a></sup>? I fear from what you say he is in
      a bad way, but what is it?<sup><a href="#loc.07344_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> It has been a terrible winter all about here for sickness
      and deaths and I guess it is no better your way from what you say—I want to
      know if there is any prospect of you giving a lecture on or about 15 April<sup><a href="#loc.07344_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup>—if
      there is I shall try to be on hand. If I go I shall probably spend a day or two in
      Phila', then a day or two in Baltimore, a day or two in Washington and a few days
      at
      the seaside (Atlantic City perhaps) just
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>to get a little change and a mouthful of fresh sea air. Did I tell you that we have
      arranged for the money to get tools to make the meter? I think Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r7">7</a></sup> will go east for
      the tools about 2<u>d</u> April and will be back here with them (I hope) early in
      June—so far all looks well for the meter and if it actually turns out
      according to appearance at present I may be a better off man after this year in which
      case I hope to see more of you and (if that is possible) do more for you. Mrs Bucke<sup><a href="#n4273" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      and little Pardee<sup><a href="#loc.07347_n5" id="r9">9</a></sup> are still in Sarnia, they are having a good time and it is doing
      them good I guess—All quiet here, plenty of work, but as long as we can do it
      we must not grumble at that—still, if I had my own way I would have a little
      less work and a little more rest
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope to see you before very long and am, with love, your friend</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0590">4. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="loc.07344_n4">5. See Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence, Volume III: 1876-1885</em>, ed. Edwin
      Haviland Miller (New York: New York University Press, 1964), 2-9. In an attempt
      to find suitable work, Stafford had worked as a turnkey at the London Asylum
      from late November 1883 to 8 March 1884. Stafford did not enjoy the work at the
      Asylum , and on 12 January 1884 wrote to his father: "The rules of the Asylum
      are absurdly strict and of a military form." See Whitman' s  letter to Harry Stafford; see
      the footnote in particular. See also Whitman's  letter to George and Susan Stafford; see note three of this
      letter in particular.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.07344_n5">6. It had been Whitman's
      custom in the past years to deliver a lecture on Loncoln on or about 15 April,
      the day of Lincoln's assassination. See Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The
         Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</em> (New York: The
      Macmillan Company, 1955), 483-484, 491-492, 524, and 525. See also Whitman's

   <p id="n4284">7. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
