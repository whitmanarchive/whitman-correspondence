   <p>Am sitting here by the fire alone early afternoon &amp; will write you a few lines—have
      had my light dinner—(stew'd chicken &amp; a cup of tea &amp; enjoy'd with sufficient
      zest)—Feelings in general not much different—of good substantial spirits, the fund
      still holds out—but quite a perceptible, steadily, almost rapidly increasing
      weakness of limb, strength, eyesight &amp;c.—In fact a, more or less slow, loosening &amp;
      deadening of the physical machine—After a dark storm, (with snow,) nearly a week,
      the sun is out this afternoon &amp; there is a half-thaw—My friend Pearsall Smith<sup><a href="#n6122" id="r1">1</a></sup> (who
      is very kind all along,) was here yesterday &amp; bro't a great bundle of London
      literary weeklies &amp;c. wh' I have been looking over—I like the advertisement pages
      ab't as well as any—I suppose Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#n4152" id="r2">2</a></sup> is there with you—I sent him three
      letters yesterday enveloped to your care. I rec'd your letter—Wilson<sup><a href="#n4185" id="r3">3</a></sup> then is the
      pub[lisher] y'r book—If you think well of it, express the whole MS. first, to me
      here, that I may look over &amp; authenticate—Put it in stout pasteboards, tie well, &amp;
      direct fully &amp; carefully, &amp; it will easily travel &amp; the expense will not be
      great<sup><a href="#duk.00922_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n6122">1. Logan Pearsall Smith
      (1865–1946) was an essayist and literary critic. He was the son of Robert
      Pearsall Smith, a minister and writer who befriended Whitman, and he was the
      brother of Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, one of Whitman's most avid followers.
      For more information on Logan, see Christina Davey "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_106.html">Smith, Logan Pearsall (1865–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4152">2. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4185">3. Frederick W. Wilson was a member of
      the Glasgow firm of Wilson &amp; McCormick that published the 1883 British
      edition of <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em>. Kennedy's
      manuscript was one of several drafts of what became two books, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman </em>(1896) and <em>The Fight
         of a Book for the World </em>(1926). For Whitman's conflicting opinions of
      Kennedy's study, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.35.html">Saturday, August 18, 1888</a>.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00922_n1">4. Kennedy wrote on  and again on the  after receipt of Whitman's letter,
      and reported an impending visit with Sanborn at Concord and Rhys's lecture
      before the Saint Botolph Club. In a postscript on January 10 he observed: "Rhys
      is obeying yr injunction to show me myself. Nothing delights me more—my
      limitations are so many. I see chances of improvement in many directions,
      already—from his friendly suggestions."<a href="#r4">[back]
