   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01005_n2">1. In a letter dated , Whitman wrote to his brother George,
      then enlisted in the 13th New York: "Jess is the same as usual<em>-</em>he works every day in the yard. He does not seem to mind the heat. He
      is employed in the store-house, where they are continually busy preparing
      stores, provisions, to send off in the different vessels. He assists in
      that."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01005_n3">2. Martin Kalbfleisch
      (1804–1873) was a Dutch-born businessman who made his fortune from a
      chemical factory he founded in Greenpoint, Long Island, in 1842. He served two
      terms as mayor of Brooklyn from 1861 to 1863 and 1868 to 1871, interrupted only
      by his term in Congress.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01005_n4">3. Charles Kinnaird Graham
      (1824–1889) was constructing engineer of the Brooklyn navy yard; the
      dry-dock and landing-ways were built under his supervision in 1857. On April 15,
      1861, he volunteered for the Union army and was commissioned as a colonel of
      Company S of the 74th New York Infantry on October 15, 1861.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01005_n5">4. William Wall
      (1800–1872) was a U.S. Representative from New York 5th District who
      served from 1861 to 1863.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01005_n6">5. James Humphrey
      (1811–1866) was a U.S. Representative from the 2nd District from 1859 to
      1861, and the 3rd District from 1865 to 1866.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01005_n100">6. This draft letter was
      probably addressed to Samuel Livingston Breese (1794–1870), Commandant of
      the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Breese was a naval officer who had command "of the
      Brooklyn navy yard from 1859 to 1861" (<em>Twentieth Century
         Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans</em>). Given that the addressee
      would apparently not know Jesse personally (and is expressly not the engineer
      but would be in a position to reinstate his employment and might be influenced
      by the mayor), it seems likely that Breese was the recipient of this letter. A
      number of factors point to a November 1861 composition date, most importantly:
      Charles Kinnaird Graham was not "the late engineer" of the Navy Yard until
      October 15, 1861 (see below); William Wall was elected to office in 1861, and
      Humphrey left office at the same time; and finally, the decision by the Kentucky
      legislature to remain neutral in the Civil War (the subject of the poem on the
      recto of this manuscript) was not reached until late September 1861.<a href="#r6">[back]
