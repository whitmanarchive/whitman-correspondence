   <p>John, I write to call your attention to an article, (Times correspondence,) I have
      just written &amp; sent about the Military Hospitals here<sup><a href="#bos.00006_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup>—as they are so generally and sadly interesting to the public. You will easily recognize
      the article—I enclose you my address—write me a line about it, at your leisure—(to-morrow
      or next day.)
   </p>
   
   <p>Is William<sup><a href="#bos.00006_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup> in New York—or where?
   </p>
   
   <p>The article is to be paid for.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Swinton (1829–1901), a journalist and
      friend of Karl Marx, became acquainted with Whitman during the Civil War.
      Swinton, managing editor of the <em>New York Times</em>,
      frequented Pfaff's, where he probably met Whitman. Whitman's correspondence with
      Swinton began on . Swinton's
      enthusiasm for Whitman was unbounded. On , Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly impressed with the great
      humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you. I read this afternoon in
      the book. I read its first division which I never before read. I could convey no
      idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more to me than all other books and
      poetry." On , Swinton wrote what
      the poet termed "almost like a love letter": "It was perhaps the very day of the
      publication of the first edition of the 'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of
      it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street, Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it
      with wonder, and felt that here was something that touched on depths of my
      humanity. Since then you have grown before me, grown around me, and grown into
      me" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.13.html">Tuesday, April 10, 1888</a>). He praised Whitman in the <em>New York Herald</em> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke,
      <em>Walt Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
      36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
      for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <em>New York Sun</em>, and for the next four years edited the
      weekly labor journal, <em>John Swinton's Paper</em>. When this
      publication folded, he returned to the <em>Sun</em>. See Robert
      Waters, <em>Career and Conversations of John Swinton</em>
      (Chicago: C.H. Kerr, 1902), and Meyer Berger, <em>The History of
         The New York Times, 1851–1951</em> (New York: Simon and Schuster,
      1951), 250–251. See also Donald Yannella, "Swinton, John
      (1829–1901)," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed.

      letter bears the address: John Swinton, | Care H. J. Raymond, | Editor New York
      Times | New York | City. It is postmarked: Washington | Feb | 2(?) | 1863 | D.

   <p id="bos.00006_n4">2. "The Great Army of the
      Sick: Military Hospitals in Washington" was printed in the <em>Times</em> of February 26; it later appeared in <em>The Wound
         Dresser</em> as "The Great Army of the Wounded" (<em>The
         Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons,
      1902], 7:81–90). Swinton in his reply to Whitman on  said: "I have crowded out a great many
      things to get [the article] in...I am glad to see you are engaged in such good
      work at Washington. It must be even more refreshing [than] to sit by Pfaff's
      privy and eat sweet-breads and drink coffee, and listen to the intolerable wit
      of the crack-brains" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, [1906–1996], 9 vols., 1:416).<a href="#r2">[back]

      William Swinton (1833–1892) was war correspondent of the <em>New York Times</em>. His hostility to Union generals and his unscrupulous
      tactics led to his suspension as a reporter on July 1, 1864. Whitman did not
      have a high opinion of William's journalism; see his letter from . He was professor of English at the
      University of California from 1869 to 1874. Thereafter he compiled extremely
      successful textbooks, and established the magazine, <em>Story-Teller</em>, in 1883.<a href="#r3">[back]
