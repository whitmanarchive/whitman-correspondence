      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We enclose a letter from the District Attorney dated Mch. 1st and received by us yesterday, March 3d.<sup><a href="#hun.00047_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Please read and return it, keeping copy of it if you so desire.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are not at present informed what portions of the book are objected to. We are however
      naturally reluctant to be identified with any legal proceedings in a matter of this
      nature. We are given to understand that if certain parts of the book should be withdrawn
      its further circulation would not be objected to. Will you advise us whether you would
      consent to the withdrawal of the present edition and the substitution of an edition
      lacking the obnoxious features?
   </p>

   <p>Our attention has been officially directed to a certain book entitled "Leaves of Grass,"
      Walt Whitman," published by you.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are of the opinion that this book is such a book as brings it within the provisions
      of the Public Statutes respecting obscene literature and suggest the propriety of
      withdrawing the same from circulation and suppressing the editions thereof.
   </p>
   
   <p>Otherwise the complaints which are proposed to be made will have to be entertained—</p>
