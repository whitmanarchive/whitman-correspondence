      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your card to hand last night, with its sad account of dear Mrs.
      Stafford's health; but what the doctor says is cheering.
      I wonder, though, what the doctor would call good weather—mild spring, I
      suppose.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Very glad, my dear old Walt, to see your strong familiar handwriting again; it does
      one good, it's so individual that it is next to seeing you. Right glad to hear of
      your good health—had an idea that you were not so well again this winter. John
      Burroughs was very violent against my intaglio; on the
      other hand, Alma Tadema—our great painter
      here—liked it very much. I take violent criticism pretty philosophically, now
      that I see how unreliable it nearly always is. John Burroughs has got a fixed idea
      about your personality, and that is that the top of your head is a foot high and any
      portrait that doesn't develop the "dome" is no portrait.—Curious what eyes a
      man may have for everything except a picture. I finished lately a life-size portrait
      of James Simmons, J.P., a hunting (fox) squire of the old school—such a fine
      old fellow. My portrait represents him standing firmly, in a scarlet hunting-coat
      well stained with many a wet chase, his great whip tucked under his arm whilst
      buttoning on his left glove, white buckskin trousers in shade relieving the scarlet
      coat, black velvet hunting cap, dark rich blue background to qualify and cool the
      scarlet. I wish you could see it. Then I have painted a subject "The Good Gray
      Poet's Gift." I have long meant to build up something of you from my studies, adding
      colour. You play a prominent part in this picture—seated at table bending
      over a nosegay of flowers, poetizing, before presenting them to mother. I am
      standing up bending over the tea-pot, with the kettle, filling it up; opposite you
      sits Giddy; out of the window a pretty view of Cannon place,
      Hampstead. Mater thinks it a pretty picture and a good likeness of you, just as you
      used to sit at tea with us at 1729 N. 22nd St. Now I am going out for a stroll on
      Hampstead Heath. Have just come in from a long ramble over the Heaths—a lovely
      soft spring day, innumerable birds in full song. I think J. B. is right when he says
      that your birds are more plaintive than ours—it's nature's way of
      compensating us for a loss of sunshine: what would England be without the merry
      lark, the very embodiment of cheeriness. Are not the Carlyle
      &amp; Emerson letters interesting? It seems to me to be one of
      the most beautiful and pathetic things in literature, C's fondness for E. But all
      Englishmen, I must tell you, are not grumblers like Carlyle; he stands quite alone
      in that quality—look at Darwin!
