   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00503_n17">1. This letter dates to August
      1, 1867. "August 1" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard Maurice
      Bucke assigned the year 1867, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date
      (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 1:378). The year is correct because Louisa had
      moved recently to the 1194 Atlantic Street boarding house after her departure
      from 840 Pacific Street (see her
      letter to Walt Whitman). This letter has the first mention of her new neighbor,
      Mr. Hambler, who departed from Atlantic Street later in the year.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00503_n7">2. Mr. Hambler (or Hamblen) was
      a soap maker who lived downstairs from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. In her  letter, she reported to Walt that
      he "is gone bought a house and moved all his manufactory which was
      immence."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00503_n8">3. According to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's  letter, she
      expected to depart from the 840 Pacific Street home on the "last of june." She
      moved to 1194 Atlantic Street, as Walt Whitman reported in his  letter to Abby Price: "Mother has
      moved to 1194 Atlantic street—(not av.)—opposite Hamilton
      st."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00465_n9">5. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York

   <p id="duk.00425_n6">6. Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George

   <p id="duk.00503_n4">7. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman in her  letter
      reported Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's confidence that George Washington
      Whitman's connection to Lane offered assurance of stable employment. Lane later
      designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city
      engineer, and he again employed George to inspect pipe in Camden, New Jersey.
      For Walt Whitman's dealings with Lane, see his  letter to Jeff Whitman. For Lane's career, see "Moses Lane,"

   <p id="duk.00425_n13">10. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r10">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00470_n8">12. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
      and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r12">[back]

   <p id="duk.00503_n10">13. <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> is William D. O'Connor's spirited defense of
      Walt Whitman against charges of indecency, issued in pamphlet form in
      1866.<br><br>
      John Burroughs (1837–1921) met Walt Whitman on the streets of
      Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman
      commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs.
      Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the correspondence
      between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs wrote several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</em> (1867), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship
      with Burroughs, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula
         [1836–1917]</a>."

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00503_n15">14. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      had spotted an unsigned <em>New York Times</em> reprint of William
      Michael Rossetti's review, which was significant for Walt Whitman's European
      reputation ("Walt Whitman's Poems," <em>London Chronicle</em>,
      July 6, 1867, 362–363). Though Walt Whitman was already aware that a
      London edition of his poems was being considered, he may not have yet known
      exact details of the article's appearance in the <em>London
         Chronicle</em> because in his 
      letter to Abby H. Price he had requested her assistance in acquiring "two or
      three copies" of the article. Rossetti in the review described <em>Leaves of Grass</em> as "incomparably the largest poetic work of our
      period" (see "Current Literature," <em>New York Times</em>, July
      28, 1867, 2). Walt Whitman had forwarded a copy of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> "for republication in England" (see his  letter to Moncure D. Conway). In his  letter to the Conway, Whitman
      stated, "I have no objection to [Rossetti's] substituting words." Whitman
      hesitated but ultimately accepted the compromise necessary to bring his work to
      a British public, but he later regretted acquiescing. Rossetti's expurgated
      edition appeared as <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/british/index.html">Poems by Walt Whitman. Selected and Edited by William Michael
            Rossetti</a></em> (London: Hotten, 1868).<a href="#r14">[back]
