      <br></br><br></br>Dear Nelly,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I write mostly to send the pictures—you needn't hurry at all about returning them—not
      that I have any thing special to write about. It has not been well with me now 
      for some ten days—not even as well as usual—Still I am up &amp; around every day. 
      I suffer much with my head, &amp; locomotion is more clumsy &amp; paralyzed even than usual—But
      my <em>inward feeling</em> &amp; faith are not seriously demoralized yet. We are having it warm 
      &amp; bright &amp; spring like here at present—very attractive out, but my head prevents me
      
      going out with any good enjoyment of it. My nieces are well—the one with the hair
      a 
      la Chinois is California, (Jessie,) the younger—the other is Mannahatta—Jeff is still
      at St. Louis, full of work—both my brothers have plenty of noble, manly work, 
      &amp; very remunerative. I have just heard from John Burroughs—he is full of house—
   </p>
