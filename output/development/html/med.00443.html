   <p>It seems the bottle I left for you was broken by accident. Here is another. Don't
      mind the tart puckery taste.

      James Matlock Scovel began to practice law in Camden in 1856. During the
      Civil War he was in the New Jersey legislature, and became a colonel in
      1863. He campaigned actively for Horace Greeley in 1872, and was a special
      agent for the U.S. Treasury during Arthur's administration. In the 1870s
      Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home for Sunday breakfast, as he did on
      December 2 and 9, 1877 (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). For a description of these breakfasts, see <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed. William Sloane
      Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel, see George
      R. Prowell's <em>The History of Camden County, New Jersey</em>
      (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886). <br><br>
      Apparently Whitman sent this note to Scovel, who was hospitalized shortly
      before the presidential election in 1876. The Camden lawyer included it in
      an article entitled "Walt Whitman: A Symposium in a Sick Room," which
      appeared in the Camden <em>Daily Post</em> on November 18,
      1876. Scovel was one of Whitman's publicity agents at this time (see
      Whitman's  letter to Rudolf
      Schmidt).<a href="#r2">[back]
