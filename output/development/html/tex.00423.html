   <p>Yes—a new one 
      Vol:
      
       edition would supersede all others not only legally (I am sole owner
      of the copyright, which I have kept thoroughly fortified from the beginning) but
      by superiority, additions, modernness, &amp;c—The Thayer &amp; Eldridge
      plates of 1860 <em>are</em> in existence in the hands of R 
      Worthington<sup><a href="#tex.00423_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> N Y (a bad egg) who has sold languid
      surreptitious copies—can be 
      stopt
      
       instantly by me &amp; will be—(The matter is not of any moment
      however)—The plates were offered to me two years ago &amp; I refused them
      as worthless—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00423_n1">1. On  Osgood asked for "the copy" in order to make
      "careful estimates as to its size, style etc. and give you our views." He also
      inquired about the plates of the Thayer &amp; Eldridge edition (<em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: G.P.
      Putnam's Sons, 1902], 8:277).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00423_n2">2. This part of the letter
      was not printed in <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>.
      The final sentence of the second paragraph was also omitted.<a href="#r2">[back]
