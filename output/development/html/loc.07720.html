      My dear friend,
      
      
   </p>  
   
   <p>
      Thank you—thank you! for several kind remembrences of you in periodicals and for
      your letter &amp; postal,<sup><a href="#loc.01390_n1" id="r12">12</a></sup> all of which bridge even the great separating waters of the 
      Atlantic. Our Alys<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n1" id="r13">13</a></sup> will have before this seen you, I trust, 
      and given us a picture of how you fare in these days. Having got through the murderous
      
      heats of the Camden summer, I greatly
       
      hope that you will have a cheerful winter. I would that I could look in on you now
      &amp; 
      then in your wilderness of books &amp; papers! With much to bring pleasure to you from
      
      far &amp; near—the hearty tribute of reverence and affection from those whose lives 
      you have helped to illuminate &amp; cheer, yet I know that there must be mixed with it
      
      physical &amp; mental heart sinkings when the unsolved, unsolvable problems of sin, pain,
      
      sorrow &amp; the unrevealed future
      
      must press upon spirits more or less controlled by physical depression. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      As Keeble 
      tells us—"the nearest 
      heart "&amp; next our own, knows not one half the reasons "why we smile or sigh"—and down
      in the depths of 
      unrevealable consciousness, the problems are fought out—alas! with what small results
      
      of certitude. Not a few of us have met great audiences with bold words while the depths
      
      of purgatory were being stirred up within us! 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      Well, dear Comrade, we are helpless—we must go on with the deepest problems unsolved,
      
      &amp; face pain, grief, loneliness, death bravely as we can. From the condition of my
      heart 
      death is a daily probability to my conciousness 
      &amp; I face all my responsibilities in the sense that it 
      <u>may</u> be for me the last time. And yet I find that I can do it cheerfully 
      &amp; can plan &amp; work as though I had a century before me.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      You have many, many friends among the young &amp; earnest in whose unsoiled 
      vigorous natures your bracing, tonic/words 
      
      find a quick lively response.
      
   </p>

      In our country home at Haslemere—close, by the way, to Tennysons<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r14">14</a></sup> 
      home—are many highly cultivated people who love you. Alys will tell you how like 
      paradise our home there is—and how often we have wished that we might have you there
      to 
      drive around the beautiful hills, two thirds in woods &amp; undergrowth for miles. I had
      hoped 
      to guide you across the ocean, but I fear that we may not now hope for that.

      has the 
      courage to go alone across the sea to finish her college course &amp; get B. A. added
      to her 
      name. Mary is under a nervous breakdown—not suffering much but 
      compelled to great quiet. Her two years old "Ray"<sup><a href="#n3137" id="r16">16</a></sup> is all sunshine to us.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

      were delivered at Whitman's seventieth birthday celebration on May 31, 1889 in
      Camden, were collected and edited by Horace Traubel. The volume was titled <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em>, and it included a
      photo of Sidney Morse's 1887 clay bust of Whitman as the frontispiece. The book
      was published in 1889 by Philadelphia publisher David McKay.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.07720_n2">4. Whitman is referring to

   <p id="n4979">5. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,

      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert

   <p id="loc.07720_n3">11. On October 31, 1889,
      Whitman noted in his Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.):
      "Sister Han has had a bad spell illness— jaundice—is now easier."
      About this time he received a letter from Heyde about Hannah's indisposition and
      his (usual) economic problems. See the letter from Heyde to Whitman of . Whitman was probably referring to
      this letter when he wrote on November 8—"Snivelling letters continued
      (apparently endlessly) f'm the miserable whelp C L H[eyde] (he knows I can't
      help myself—I never answer them—I feel as if I could crush him out
      like an offensive bed-bug wh' he is)" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). The
      invective continued on November 18: "He is the worst nuisance &amp; worriment of
      my illness —Keeps me back, (his damnable letters) ab't the worst factor of
      all time—always whining &amp; squeezing me for <em>more
         money</em>—damn him—he ought to be crush'd out as you w'd a
      bed-bug" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). On December 19 Whitman sent $10 to
      Hannah "(5 for C)," and, apparently in response to two letters from Heyde in
      December, almost hysterical in their pleas for money, forwarded $2 on
      December 31 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). See the letters from Heyde to Whitman
      of  and .<a href="#r11">[back]

      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
