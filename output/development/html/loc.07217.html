   <p>I was heartily glad to get this morning your note of 25th with its' three encolsures,
      the notes from Miss Bates,<sup><a href="#n4098" id="r2">2</a></sup> Rhys,<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      and Sadakitchi.<sup><a href="#n4980" id="r4">4</a></sup> I have proofs continuously to p.104 and shall
      hope to soon get the E.H &amp; Fox pieces.<sup><a href="#loc.07217_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> I wish the Hospital piece which the
      Century has<sup><a href="#loc.07217_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> could go in the book too but we should have to wait too long for that I
      fear? I do wish I could hear that you were gaining strength, you are <u>certainly</u> better mentally and from what I hear you eat
      better and are better in yourself. There must have been <u>some
         little</u> extension of the paralisis  to make you helpless in the legs—I
      still <u>hope</u> however. You have  undoubtedly gained <u>some</u> and I do not see why you should not gain more—we must have
      patience and not give up.
   </p>
   
   <p>Willy Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r7">7</a></sup> is to be home in a month with his meter <u>done</u>. I may have to go East on that business after he
      comes and stays here for a rest so I look forward to seeing you again before very
      long. By that time Osler<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r8">8</a></sup> will be back and we can have some talk—but I do not
      look for medicine to do much for you except at a pinch—it might tide you
      over

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4098">2. Redelia Bates (1842–1943) was a female
      suffrage lecturer from St. Louis who married American socialist Albert Brisbane.
      After his death, she edited and published his autobiography.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03310_n1">3. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4980">4. C. Sadakichi Hartmann (ca.
      1867–1944) was an art historian and early critic of photography as an art
      form. He visited Whitman in Camden in the 1880s and published his conversations
      with the poet in 1895. Generally unpopular with other supporters of the poet, he
      was known during his years in Greenwich Village as the "King of Bohemia." For
      more information about Hartmann, see John F. Roche, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_113.html">Hartmann, C. Sadakichi (ca. 1867–1944)</a>," <em>Walt

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07217_n2">5. Whitman was having friends
      help him read proofs for <em>November Boughs</em>; the last two
      pieces in the book were essays on the Quakers Elias Hicks (1748–1830) and
      George Fox (1624–1691). For more on its publication and reception, see

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07217_n3">6. Bucke is not aware that
      Whitman's "Last of the War Cases" was already a part of <em>November Boughs</em>, as he would discover when he received the rest of the
      page proofs. This essay was a revised version of "Army Hospitals and Cases:
      Memoranda at the Time, 1863–66," which appeared in <em>Century Magazine</em> in October 1888.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4284">7. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="n4302">8. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on
