      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter day before yesterday—We have had some stormy weather here too,
      but nothing so bad as you must have had—I wrote to Hannah last Saturday—I was down
      to the Hospital last Sunday, &amp; also yesterday—there is a soldier there very bad with
      bleeding at the lungs—it is doubtful if he recovers—he is from Harper's Ferry, W.
      Va.—He is not willing to have me write to his folks, nor will he write himself—his
      mother is feeble, &amp; he says it would hurt her—he is an only son—he is in the 44th
      Reg. Infantry—He likes to have me come &amp; sit a while with him—so I go—I do not allow
      him to talk much,  as it is best for him to keep very quiet. He is quite a southerner,
      although in our army—&amp; takes great interest in politics—his name is Andrew J. Kephart<sup><a href="#nyp.00258_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Mother, I tell you all the particulars,  as I know you will be interested tho' a
      perfect stranger. There are all kinds of soldiers in the hospitals,  some good &amp; some
      the other thing. But there are always some that appreciate deeply any kindness &amp; friendship—&amp;
      it helps them along too, more than one would think.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I suppose you got your almanacks —both are calculated for <em>this</em> region, not New York, &amp; one is a sort of Catholic almanac—I saw it had all the Saints'
      days.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>O'Connor, &amp; the wife too, were both very much taken with Jeff, &amp; speak about him often.</p>
   
   
   <p>Surratt is here in jail—his sister Anna goes to see him most every day—poor girl.<sup><a href="#nyp.00258_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>It is pleasant here this forenoon—as I look out of my window, the river looks fine—there
      is a slight haze in the air but the warm sun is shining—O'Connor has just been in
      to see me a few moments—they have invited me up there to dinner, but I believe I don't
      care to go to-day.<sup><a href="#nyp.00258_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I was up at the Capitol last night, to see the House in session, &amp; walk around—there
      was nothing very interesting—they were debating some appropriation Bill.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother dear, I hope this will find you all right, &amp; free from rheumatism—Love to George
      &amp; Mat &amp; all—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00258_n3">1. Walt Whitman also wrote
      about Kephart's recovery in his , , and  letters to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, noting that by the time of
      his  letter, Kephart had "quite
      recovered."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00258_n1">2. John H. Surratt, who had
      been a secret dispatch bearer for the Confederacy and involved, with his mother
      Anna, in John Wilkes Booth's conspiracy, fled the country before the murder of
      Abraham Lincoln. He remained a fugitive until he was arrested in Egypt in 1866.
      Unlike his mother, who had been convicted by a military tribunal and ordered
      hanged on July 7, 1865, the son was tried in a civil court, between June 10 and
      August 10, 1867. Walt Whitman described the trial in his  letter to Alfred Pratt. When the jury could not agree,
      a new trial was ordered, but because of inadequate evidence the government
      quietly released Surratt on June 22, 1868. His sister Anna sought clemency for
      her mother in 1865, but, presumably because of a conspiracy, her plea never
      reached the desk of President Andrew Johnson. See David Miller DeWitt, <em>The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln</em> (New York:
      Macmillan, 1909).<a href="#r2">[back]

      declined the invitation in his 
      letter to Ellen M. O'Connor.<a href="#r3">[back]
