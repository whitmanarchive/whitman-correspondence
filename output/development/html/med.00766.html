   <p> Your two letters<sup><a href="#med.00766_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> received this day. I think, after all, that my former objections to
      giving the English of the L. of G. with the translation were not so well-founded as
      they seemed, and it shall be done as you wish so far as I can see at present. I will
      gladly insert the extract from your letter in the preface,<sup><a href="#med.00766_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> and will give Salut au Monde.<sup><a href="#med.00766_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> We go for a month or so
      into the country soon, and from the time you get this till the end of June my
      address will be Liegau bei Radeberg, Saxony, if you have anything to say or send.
      I
      am sorry to hear you have been ill—hope this finds you still on the
      mend—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
