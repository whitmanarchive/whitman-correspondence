      continuing so long and I do not like those darting pains you mention. I have written
      to Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r2">2</a></sup> about it and have told him to arrange to have some
      good doctor from Phila come over and see what you need. I hope you will not make any
      difficulty about this reasonable stop. If the Dr. does you no good he certainly will
      do you no harm. I am much disappointed at what you tell me about the new glasses and
      I think you would be wrong to lay them aside as you seem to be doing—if they
      are not right they should be altered and if they are right they should be worn.<sup><a href="#loc.07133_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> Thomas &amp; Fox gave me the glasses I have on at

      more than once) but there is no harm in saying it again in slightly varied
      language—the language of the article is certainly admirable and what it says
      and suggests is important enough to hear almost any amount of repetition

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
