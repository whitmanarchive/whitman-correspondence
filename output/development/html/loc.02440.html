      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Just a few lines to acknowledge the receipt of the "Camden Daily Courier" for June
      2nd 1883<sup><a href="#loc.02440_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>[,] "Unity" Aug 28th 1890<sup><a href="#loc.02440_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; the accompanying slips "of that blithe throat
      of thine" "Yonnondio" "Halcyon Days" &amp; "the voice of the rain".<sup><a href="#loc.02440_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>The <u>Daily Courier</u> is of especial interest as containing an
      admirable critique of Dr Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> book &amp; I fear in sending it to me you have
      despoiled yourself of one of your treasures but
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>this will all the more enhance its value to me and I desire to thank you very
      cordially for it &amp; for the other papers you so kindly sent.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr Wallace<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r5">5</a></sup> has kindly shewn me the post card he received from you on Sept 12th<sup><a href="#loc.02440_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> from
      which I am extremely sorry to learn that you are suffering from an attack of the <u>Grippe</u>—though from the fact that you were not then
      confined to the house we are in hopes that it is not a very severe one &amp; that
      it has by this time passed off &amp; left no bad effects upon you. We hope to hear
      better news from
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>you soon.</p>
   
   
   <p>We have seen the French article in the <u>Universal</u>
      <u>Review</u><sup><a href="#loc.02440_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup>—in fact I have the number containing it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Later 8pm</p>
   
   
   <p>We have had a glorious day for our out-of-door meeting—an ideally perfect day.
      Nearly all "the boys" were present with two friends S the reading of my notes
      &amp;c which took place in a green field beneath a tree occupied nearly two hours
      &amp; was much enjoyed by every one &amp; by none more than myself for I seemed to
      be living over again the happy time I spent with you[.] Much were they all
      interested in all I had to say &amp; much do they appreciate
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>all your kindness to me &amp; thro me to them. They esteem it a high honour to have
      been medially brought into personal contact with you &amp; Mr Wallace has been
      commissioned to express this to you by letter which he will do probably by next
      mail
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pardon my writing more at present as it is close on mail time</p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With reverential love &amp; gratitude
      <br></br>I remain
      <br></br>Yours affectionately
      <br></br>J. Johnston

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02440_n1">1. Johnston is probably
      referring to the Camden <em>County Courier</em>, which published a
      notice of Bucke's <em>Walt Whitman</em> on 2 June 1883.<a href="#r1">[back]

      11 (26 November 1887): 267; "" originally appeared in the <em>New York
         Herald</em> (29 January 1888): 12; and "" originally appeared in <em>Outing</em> 6 (August 1885): 570. Whitman reprinted all four poems in <em> &gt;November Boughs</em>, which supplied the poems for the
      "Sands at Seventy" annex to the 1889 reprinting of the 1881 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6121">5. James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt
