   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00608_n4">1. This letter is nearly
      impossible to date precisely. Richard Maurice Bucke dated it April 3, 1871,
      and Edwin Haviland Miller dated it April 16?, 1871 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77], 2:368). Because the letter refers both to an expected
      visit from George Washington Whitman and his "wife" that has been postponed
      until the following Saturday and to "quite a seige [<em>sic</em>] the last month or so," a phrase that presumably refers to the
      departure of Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman and daughters Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa after an extended visit, the letter dates at least a week (and
      perhaps several) after the marriage of George to Louisa Orr Haslam and a few
      (or several) days after the departure of Jeff Whitman's family. One separate
      matter, the expected move of the Mann family, may suggest a late April date.
      However, these factors cannot be pinned down with certainty, so the letter
      could date as early as March 19, 1871, as late May 14, 1871, and to almost
      any Sunday in between.<br><br>
      If George has a "wife" already, the letter dates no earlier than the Sunday
      that followed his marriage. George married Louisa Orr Haslam on either March
      14, 1871 or April 14, 1871. Whitman scholars since Gay Wilson Allen have
      preferred the April date: see Richard Maurice Bucke, "Genealogy of Whitman
      Family," Trent Collection, Duke University, reprinted in Gay Wilson Allen,
      <em>The Solitary Singer</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1955),
      596. This assumption probably guided Miller's April 16? date for this
      letter. However, Allen's source, Bucke's typescript genealogy, is derived
      from a manuscript in Walt Whitman's hand, and Whitman's manuscript differs:
      Whitman identified March 14, 1871 as George's marriage date. See Walt
      Whitman, "Marriages," Missouri Historical Society, reprinted in Edward F.
      Grier, ed., <em>Notebooks and Unpublished Prose
         Manuscripts</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1984), 27.
      Bucke's notation on Louisa's  letter to Walt also differs: there Bucke writes "George
      married March '71." An independent source derived from Camden county records
      also dates George's marriage March 14 (H. Stanley Craig, <em>Camden County New Jersey Marriages, 1837–1910: Records Filed in
         the Office of the County Clerk</em> [Merchantville, New Jersey: H.
      Stanley Craig, 1932], 133). As two independent sources, one in Walt's hand
      and one derived independently from county marriage records agree on March
      14, the date of this letter, if to a Sunday just after George's marriage, is
      March 19 or March 26, 1871.<br><br>
       If Louisa's reference to a "seige [<em>sic</em>] the last
      month or so" refers to the visit of Jeff Whitman's family to Brooklyn, their
      departure to return to St. Louis dates four to six weeks after their
      arrival. Louisa at one time expected Mattie and daughters to arrive in
      Brooklyn in early February: "we are looking for matt," Louisa wrote in her
       letter to Walt. The
      two-week discrepancy between Louisa's initial and later expectation of
      Mattie's arrival highlights the speculative quality of presumptions that
      have guided this initial assignment of the letter's date to March 19 or
      March 26, 1871. Questioning those assumptions undermines either of those
      possible dates. The phrase "month or so" may refer to the entire visit of
      four to six weeks by Mattie and family in Brooklyn, but another letter
      places Mattie and family in Brooklyn and on the point of departure for
      Camden with George. See Louisa's  letter to Walt, which is assigned a most probable range
      of March 7 to March 21, 1871. If Louisa defined her "seige" as having begun
      after the return of Mattie and daughters from Camden, Jeff's family's visit
      could have begun in late February and continued for a few weeks before the
      departure to Camden. If Mattie and daughters departed Camden to return to
      Brooklyn on March 21 or so, their return could mark the new start as an
      extended month-plus visit to Brooklyn (the "seige").<br><br>
      In addition, at the time of the letter Louisa expected the Mann family to
      move soon, and that expectation may date this letter to April 30, 1871, just
      before May 1, the typical moving day in Brooklyn. However, the most common
      date for moving is highly speculative if it cannot be corroborated by
      another factor. And it cannot be in this case. Ultimately, any factor cited
      so far may be independent of the others: the Mann family's moving day, the
      arrival of Jeff's family in Brooklyn, George and Louisa Orr's marriage date,
      the visit of Jeff's family to George and Louisa Orr in Camden, the start and
      end of the approximately month-long "seige," the separation of Jeff's
      family's visit into multiple stages, and the departure of Jeff's family for
      St. Louis. Therefore, the letter may date between possible marriage dates,
      from March 20 to 27. The full range of possible dates, given either of the
      two marriage dates, is March 20 to May 14, but the most probable date
      range—if Jeff's family has departed for St. Louis, their visit began
      in late February and extended for approximately six weeks, and George and
      Louisa Orr married on March 14, 1871—is April 9 or April 16, 1871, a
      week or so after Mattie and daughters departed to return to St. Louis. If
      the April 14 marriage date is assumed, the latest date, April 30, 1871, is
      preferred as it corresponds also to Brooklyn's moving day.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00556_n3">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00608_n5">3. May 1, when annual leases
      expired, was the typical moving day in Brooklyn. The Mann family—though
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman usually spells their name "man"—lived downstairs
      from her at 1149 Atlantic Avenue between September 1868 and April 1869. Shortly
      after Louisa's arrival at Atlantic Avenue, a young child in the family, named
      Charley, succumbed to the croup (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman). She mentioned the Mann family in
      multiple letters while at 1149 Atlantic Avenue, just after they moved in, but
      aside from this single brief reference she made no mention of them after her
      move to Portland Avenue in April 1869. This letter, by indicating that the Manns
      were moving out, suggests that they were either taken on as boarders in the
      Portland Avenue house that George Washington Whitman built as a residence for
      his mother or rented one of George's other houses. Louisa did remain in contact
      with the Mann family: her letter to Mary E. Mann shortly after the death of
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman is not extant, but Mary Mann's  reply indicates that Louisa had
      reported on Walt's stroke and on her residence with George and wife Louisa Orr
      in Camden. Louisa also inquired about the health of Mary, her three daughters,
      and Mary's mother. In 1873 the Mann family resided at 89 North Portland Avenue
      (Library of Congress, Harned Collection).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00608_n6">4. Though his letter is not
      extant, Walt Whitman apparently teased his mother about moving a bed to the
      front room (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r4">[back]
