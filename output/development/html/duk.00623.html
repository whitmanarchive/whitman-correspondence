   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00623_n2">1. This letter dates to March
      21, 1873. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to March 21, 1873, and Edwin
      Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:206–207, n. 44). The date "M 21" in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand
      corresponds to March 1873 because that date is consistent with the publication
      of Walt Whitman's "The Singing Thrush" in the <em>New York Daily
         Graphic</em> and with the February 1873 death of Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman, Louisa's daughter-in-law.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00623_n1">2. Walt Whitman's March 19,
      1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant (see Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:206, n. 44). Walt had enclosed a
      copy of the March 15, 1873 <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_title/per.00107.html"><em>New York Daily Graphic</em></a>, which featured his
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00129.html">"The Singing Thrush"</a>, in his  letter to Louisa.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n7">3. The "aunt" who was engaged
      to assist Louisa "Lou" Orr Haslam has not been identified. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman described Lou's aunt as English, and Louisa was not fond of the aunt's
      company: "i wouldent be very sorry if aunty wasent here" (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). She is named "aunt Lib" and "aunt Libby" in Louisa's  and  letters to Walt.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00623_n9">4. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman, Jeff described the death of his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman
      (see Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother
         Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em>, [Kent, Ohio: Kent State
      University Press, 1984], 158–161). Mattie Whitman died on February 19,
      1873, from complications associated with a throat ailment.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00623_n7">5. Manahatta Whitman
      (1860–1886), known as "Hattie," was the older daughter of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. After her mother's death,
      Hattie reported that "Papa will never write a letter he makes me write all the
      letters" (see her  letter to Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman [Feinberg Collection, Library of Congress]). Hattie, who
      lived most of the first seven years of her life in the same home with Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman, was especially close to her grandmother. Hattie and her younger
      sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957) were both favorites of their uncle
      Walt.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00623_n3">6. After the death of Martha
      Mitchell Whitman, Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and daughters Manahatta
      "Hattie" and Jessie Louisa began to board with Mary Moody and Philemon C.
      Bulkley. According to Hattie, they moved on March 8: "Papa has a very nice room
      but I sleep with Minnie Bulkley a young lady about sixteen years old" (see
      Hattie's  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman [Feinberg Collection, Library of Congress]).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">7. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n6">8. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00623_n11">9. A week earlier Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman had written that George Washington Whitman was away "to see about
      getting the brookly [<em>sic</em>] work" (see her  letter to Walt Whitman). Despite
      this initial disappointment, George again visited a Brooklyn water commissioner
      for the "prospect of getting the brooklyn work" (see Louisa's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00621_n14">10. In January 1873, Walt
      Whitman suffered a paralytic stroke that made walking difficult. He first
      reported it in his  letter to his
      mother and continued to provide regular notes on his condition. By mid-March
      Whitman was taking brief walks out to the street and began to hope that he could
      resume work in the office (see his 
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00614_n8">11. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman died on February 19, 1873 from complications associated with a throat
      ailment. Mattie and her husband Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman had two
      daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved
      to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
      emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa. For more on Mattie,
      see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha
         Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      1–26. Waldron reports that a physician identified the cause of death as
      cancer (3). Robert Roper has speculated that Mattie's accompanying bronchial
      symptoms may have been associated with tuberculosis (<em>Now the
         Drum of War</em> [New York: Walker, 2008], 78–79).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00623_n13">12. After Walt Whitman's
      stroke, Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor (1830–1913) made regular visits and
      assisted in nursing him. In his early Washington years, Whitman lived with
      William D. and Nelly O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John
      Burroughs, were to remain his close associates. Before marrying William
      O'Connor, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery movement and women's rights
      movements as a contributor to the <em>Liberator</em> and to a
      women's rights newspaper <em>Una</em>. Nelly had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman. The correspondence between Whitman and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r12">[back]
