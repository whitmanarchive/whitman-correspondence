   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Donaldson
      (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
      introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
      the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
      carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt
         Whitman, the Man</em> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see
      Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_111.html">Donaldson, Thomas (1843–1898)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01481_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Thomas Donaldson | 326 N 40th Street | Philadelphia. It is postmarked: Ca[illegible] | Jan 14 | 8 PM | 89. The
      envelope is printed with Whitman's address as follows: Walt Whitman, | Camden, |
      New Jersey.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6011">2. Thomas Donaldson (1843–1898)
      was a Philadelphia attorney whom Whitman met in 1882. Donaldson helped to
      facilitate meetings between Whitman and Bram Stoker in the 1880s, and raised
      money for the purchase of a horse and buggy for Whitman in 1885. He also wrote a
      biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt Whitman: The Man</em> (New
      York: Francis P. Harper, 1896). For more about Whitman's relationship with
      Donaldson, see Steven Schroeder, "Donaldson, Thomas (1843–1898)," in <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em> (New York: Garland
      Publishing, 1998), 185.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01481_n2">3. According to an entry in
      The Commonplace-Book on March 25, 1887, Clayton
      Wesley Peirson took Walt Whitman's "'Day Book' to be re-bound—(is to make
      me a new one also)." At the beginning of his last "Day Book," the poet noted:
      "CWP is located (July 24 '90) at 3819 Lancaster av: Phila—real estate
      office." (<em>The Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4168">4. Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888)included a profile photo of the poet
      on the title page. The nearly 900-page book was published in December 1888. For
      more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">5. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r5">[back]
