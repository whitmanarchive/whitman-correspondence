      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I write to you these lines from old Norway. I am dwelling here in Gausdal in one of
      these ancient farms, whose names are perhaps thousand years old. I am walking among
      these heights—when the great mountains [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">are scattered?</span>]
       over the [
      <span class="unclear">scanty earth?</span>]
      and laying on the same place as when for 5-6 hundred years ago the fierce chiefs met
      with their yeomen and retainers in 
      
      
      
      bloody battles. At present all is very peaceful. The red blood-hours are spread over
      the whole valley, and good roads have been cut among the [
      <span class="unclear">dark?</span>]
       firs and pines. The river is running through the bottom as a smiling [
      <span class="unclear">child?</span>]
      . Sometimes it is white and [
      <span class="unclear">reeking?</span>]
       with foam as an injured ghost and for two weeks ago it took ago a new bridge as early
      as I am flowing a feather away with the breath of my mouth. 
   </p>
   
   <p>The people is good [
      <span class="unclear">natured?</span>]
      , vigorous and kind hearted. The
      
      
      peasants are still [
      <span class="unclear">here saying?</span>]
      , [
      <span class="unclear">"Thou"?</span>]
        to the strangers. A great deal of Englishmen and some Americans are travelling here
      in Norway.
   </p>
   
   <p>The editor of "Aftenbladet" in Christiania told me, that he [
      <span class="unclear">has?</span>]
       forwarded one copy of Elsters criticism to you. I sent another from Copenhagen.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have thought, that it could amaze you to receive some lines from this old proud
      mountain-country.  Don't forget to let me know, if they have duely reached you.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The Swede Peter Carl Rudolph
      Schmidt (1836–1899) was the editor of the idealist <em>For
         Idé og Virkelighed</em> ("For Idea and Reality") and had translated
      Whitman's <em>Democratic Vistas</em> into Danish in 1871 (see the
      letter from Schmidt to Whitman of ).
