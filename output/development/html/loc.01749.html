      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter, with cheering wishes &amp; prophecies came last Tuesday—God bless you, boy—for
      all such things help much—I had a bad spell this morning—have something of the kind
      pretty often—Still it seems certain I am improving, 
      generally,—&amp; that my general strength is better I am not near as bad 
      as I was five weeks ago—have some hours in which I feel quite like myself again—Keep
      up good heart nearly all the time—&amp; you must too, dear son.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—So I see Beau Hickman<sup><a href="#loc.01749_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> has died of a stroke of paralysis—in the paper this morning 
      I see a piece about his body being resurrected from potter's field—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Pete I see a collision of some trains on the B. &amp; P. road reported 
      in the tunnel at Baltimore yesterday morning early in which a brakeman named Hawkinson<sup><a href="#loc.01749_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> was instantly killed—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>I was over to Philadelphia yesterday—there is a large reading room, the Mercantile
      Library, 
      10th st. where I go occasionally—it is quite handy—they have all the papers 
      from every where—have the Wash. Chronicle Capital, &amp;c.—Then I took a ride 
      in the Market st. cars, &amp; was caught in a violent rain at ½ past 7 coming home—the
      moment I got home, it stopt, &amp; cleared off a beautiful moonlit night.—It is clear and pretty hot here to-day—I
      am sitting here in the front room 
      in the same big old mahogany chair I gave mother 20 years ago, by the open 
      window writing this—I am feeling better since breakfast.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Pete the papers you sent came last Monday all right—I have rec'd a letter from Chas
      Eldridge—&amp; another from Walter Godey, the young man who is working for me as my substitute
      in the office—all was going on well in the office—I send a couple of papers to-day—nothing
      particular—send the <u>Herald</u>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Did I tell you that a doctor<sup><a href="#loc.01749_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I have talked with here says my real disease is <u>the brain not being properly furnished 
         and nourished with blood</u>—(it is a disease the doctors call <u>cerebral anâemia</u>)—the doctor says it has been long a-coming, &amp; will be long a-going—says I will get
      over it though—says the <u>paralysis</u> comes from that, &amp; that it (the paralysis) is not very 'formidable'—I am following
      Dr. Drinkard's advice, taking no medicine, living very carefully—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01749_n1">1. On September 1 the
      Washington <em>Daily Morning Chronicle</em> noted that Robert S.
      Hickman, about 49 years old, was close to death. Evidently Hickman had
      squandered a fortune of $40,000, had been disowned by his family, and was now
      impoverished. On the same day the New York <em>Herald</em>
      observed that Hickman "is known throughout the country by reputation and
      familiar to visitors to Washington for many years." He was interred in the
      potter's field on September 2. On the following day, after a subscription was
      raised among Washington businessmen to rebury the body in the Congressional
      Cemetery, it was discovered that the remains had been desecrated. On September 4
      the headlines in the <em>Chronicle</em> read: "Ghouls. | Graveyard
      Hyenas. | Beau Hickman's Body Exhumed. | Horrible and Revolting Details." For
      Whitman's opinion of Hickman, see the letter from Whitman to Doyle of .<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.01749_n2">2. The New York <em>Tribune</em> reported this accident on the Baltimore and
      Potomac Railroad, in which C. J. Hawkinson (not Hankinson) was crushed to
      death.<a href="#r2">[back]
