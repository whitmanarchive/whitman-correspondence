      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Shall you never find it in your heart to say a kind word to
      me again? or a word of some sort? Surely I must have
      written what displeased you very much that you should turn
      away from me as the tone of your last letter &amp; the ten
      months' silence which have followed seem 
      
      to express to [
      <span class="unclear">me
         with</span>]
       such emphasis. But if so, tell me of it, tell me how—
      with perfect candour, I am worthy of that—a willing learner
      &amp; striver; not afraid of the pain of looking my own faults &amp;
      shortcomings steadily in the face. Or it may be my words have
      led you to do me some kind of injustice in thought,—I then
      could defend myself. But if it is simply that 
      
      you are preoccupied, 
      too busy—perhaps very eagerly beset by hundreds
      like myself whose hearts are so drawn out of their breasts by
      your Poems that they cannot rest without striving, some
      way or other, to draw near to you personally—then write
      once more &amp; tell me so &amp; I will learn to be content. But
      please let it be a letter just like the first three you wrote: &amp;
      do not fear that I shall take it 
      
      to mean anything it doesn't
      mean. I shall never do that again, though it was natural
      enough at first, with the deep unquestioning belief I had that
      I did but answer a call; that I not only might, but ought, on
      pain of being untrue to the greatest, sweetest instincts &amp;
      aspirations of my own soul, to answer it with all my heart &amp;
      strength &amp; life. I say to myself, I say to you as I did in my
      first letters, "This voice that has come to me from over the
      Atlantic is the one 
      
      divine voice that has penetrated to my
      soul: is the utterance of a nature that sends out life giving
      warmth &amp; light to my inward self as actually as the Sun does
      to my body, &amp; draws me to it and shapes &amp; shall shape my
      course just as the Sun shapes the Earth's. "Interlocked in a
      vast similitude" indeed are these inner &amp; outer truths of our
      lives. It may be that this shaping of my life course toward
      you will have to be all inward
      
      that to feed upon your words
      till they pass into the very substance &amp; action of my soul is
      all that will be given to me, &amp; the grateful yearning tender
      love growing ever deeper &amp; stronger out of that will have to go
      dumb &amp; actionless all my days here. But I can wait long,
      wait patiently; know well, realize more [
      <span class="unclear">clearly</span>]
       indeed that [
      <span class="unclear">this</span>]
       wingless, clouded, half-developed soul of me has a long,
      long novitiate to live through before it can 
      
      meet &amp; answer
      yours on equal terms so as fully to satisfy you, to be in very
      truth &amp; deed a dear Friend, a chosen companion, a source of
      joy to you as you of light &amp; life to me. But that is what I
      will live &amp; die hoping &amp; striving for. That covers &amp; includes
      all the aspirations all the high hopes I am capable of. And
      were I to fall away from 
      
      this belief it would be a fall into utter
      blackness &amp; despair, as one for whom the Sun in Heaven is
      blotted out.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
