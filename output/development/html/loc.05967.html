      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman—
      <br></br>Dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Your kind note of the 26th is
      received also the package—&amp;
      "Leaves of Grass"—both of which
      are to me more precious
      than gold. I sent you
      yesterday a copy of my paper
      containing the lecture Keep
      off the Grass. As it may be
      withheld by the P O. Officials
      I send you one to day enclosed
      in a new book that I have
      just published. The whole
      edition of my paper is still held
      at the Post Office awaiting
      decision from Washington as to
      
      its alleged indecency
      by PM. Tobey. As in
      my next number I shall
      have the whole history of
      this infamous impertinence
      and audacity in print
      I will not weary you with
      writing it here—. I have
      received a very kind note
      from Mr O'Connor from
      whose splendid article I 
      quoted—containing the offer
      of his kind offices at
      Washington. As I cannot
      think there can be another
      edition-of-such-holy impurity
      and-insensibility to all the 
      sacred rights of man as
      Tobey I hope soon to
      
      have it in circulation
      I have a circulation of 2600—scattered all over the Union—Canada—&amp; a few of them
      in England Scotland France
      Switzerland Italy Australia
      New Zealand &amp; the West Indies
      among whom you have many ardent admirers—When I first
      lectured from Leaves of Grass
      I received many expressions of
      gratitude from them—I am sorry that last Winter
      I allowed a press of business
      to lead me to postpone calling
      on you until I found that
      it was too late—. I am 
      however loath to intrude my
      self on public personages—as I know that much of their 
      valuable time is thus wasted.—I shall however always feel
      as though I have touched your
      soul &amp; felt the beating of
      your heart near to mine
      in the few kind words
      you have sent me—and whenever
      I read Leaves of Grass
      your personal inscription on the
      fly leaf—will make every
      line fragrant with your love.
