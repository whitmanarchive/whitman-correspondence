   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anson Ryder, Jr., a soldier, had apparently left
      Armory Square Hospital in 1865 and returned to his family at Cedar Lake, New
      York, accompanied by another injured soldier named Wood (probably Calvin B.
      Wood; see <em>Notes and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</em>, ed.
      Edward F. Grier [New York: New York University Press, 1961–1984], 6:673).
      For other correspondence between Ryder and Walt Whitman, see Ryder's , letter to Whitman. Excerpts from
      five of Whitman's letters to an unidentified ex-soldier (later identified as
      Anson Ryder, Jr.) were printed by Florence Hardiman Miller in the <em>Overland Monthly</em> under the title "Some Unpublished
      Letters of Walt Whitman's. Written to a Soldier Boy" in 1904. Because of the
      fragmentary nature of her quotations, she was not able to date most of the
      letters or to offer any initial conjectures about the identity of the recipient.
      However, Edwin Haviland Miller later identified the soldier as Ryder. Florence
      Miller seems to imply that the correspondence continued into the early
      1870s.

      appeared in <em>The Correspondence</em>, the recipient was unknown
      (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed. [New York: New York University Press,
