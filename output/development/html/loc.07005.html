   <p>Yours of 19th Oct rec'd—(I came up yesterday from the country &amp;
      found it)—I return you Forman's letter—am glad you sent it me—but have
      nothing decisive to say at present <em>for myself</em> about New English edition<sup><a href="#loc.07005_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Doctor, I want to come to see you &amp; be with you all, truly—&amp; shall do
      so—but havn't felt the spirit move me the past summer—look for me next summer—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am well, for me—have had a good summer—

   <p>Rec'd a long &amp; kind letter from Tennyson day before yesterday<sup><a href="#loc.07005_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—

   <p>As I scribble this (noon) the greatest gale I ever knew seems to be just
      subsiding—Our town streets are strewed with wrecks, roofs, timbers, trees &amp;c—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07005_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr R M Bucke | Asylum for the Insane | London Ontario | Canada. It is
      postmarked: Philadelphia | Oct | 23 | 5 PM | Pa.; London | Oc 25 | 78 |
      (?).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07005_n2">2. This is the earliest
      surviving letter to Richard Maurice Bucke, the Canadian physician and mystic,
      who became one of the poet's closest friends in the later years and an executor
      of his literary effects after his death.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07005_n3">3. Apparently Bucke sent
      Whitman's letter to H. Buxton Forman since it was among letters to Forman and
      Ernest Rhys which were acquired by the Berg Collection. The letters of Bucke and
      Forman are not known. Once again Forman expressed interest in printing an
      unabridged edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in England; see the
      letter from Whitman to Forman of .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07005_n4">4. See the letter from
      Tennyson to Whitman of . Whitman
      did not receive it until October 21 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07005_n5">5. In this letter Whitman
      enclosed a printed slip of a poem entitled "Thou Who Hast Slept All Night upon
      the Storm," with the following notation: "The terrible gale &amp; destruction,
      here this morning, brings(?) up this little piece to my mind—let me send
      it as a souvenir."<a href="#r5">[back]
