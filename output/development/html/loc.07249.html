   <p>I have your good letter of 25 &amp; 26 inst.<sup><a href="#loc.07249_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I note all you say about my "W.W" Your
      wishes will be religiously respected I did think of considerable changes (for I am
      certain the book will sell by &amp; by) but was <u>never</u> set
      on them and less so lately. Yes, I shall leave it stand as it is and add under a
      later date what else I may have to say. I am glad Dr. Osler<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r3">3</a></sup> has
      been to see you again, I do not think the pain you speak of means anything serious,
      though no doubt it is annoying—I hope it is gone by now. Have to go to  go to the city in a few
      minutes shall take this in and post it some men (capitalists) coming this
      afternoon to see the meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> shall tell you tomorrow whether we succeed in doing any
      business with them. We are moving slow just now—feeling our way—we hope
      to be in a positon soon to launch out

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on
