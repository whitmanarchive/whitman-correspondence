   <p>Nothing special with me. Rainy &amp; dark to day—not cold. Yours rec'd with <em>Critic</em> letter—A letter from Mrs: Costelloe<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> this
      mn'g—all well &amp; busy, baby growing &amp; well<sup><a href="#n4184" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I am not surprised at
      the refusal to publish in C<sup><a href="#loc.07635_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—the opposition &amp; <em>resentment</em> at L of G. is probably as concentrated &amp; vital &amp;
      determined in New York (my own city) as anywhere, if not more vital—&amp; I do
      not count the Gilders<sup><a href="#n4111" id="r5">5</a></sup> as essentially <em>on our
         side</em>—they are smart &amp; polite but worldly &amp; conventional—as
      to the literary classes anyhow I will get a few exceptional dips out of
      them—but mainly I will have to wait for another generation—But this I
      have long known—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I am sitting here all alone to-day—I do not eat dinner these short
      days—only breakfast &amp; supper—my appetite fair—had some
      buckwheat cakes &amp; raw oysters for my breakfast. Shall most probably not write
      you at F[lorida] again—

      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">2. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="n4184">3. Rachel Pearsall Conn Costelloe
      (1887–1940) was Mary's first daughter. She eventually married Oliver
      Strachey (brother of biographer Lytton Strachey) and was a writer and women's
      suffrage activist who ran for a seat in the British parliament soon after women
      were granted the right to vote.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.07635_n2">4. Apparently in a lost
      letter Bucke informed Whitman that he had submitted to <em>The
         Critic</em> an article entitled "One Word More on Walt Whitman." About
      February 20, 1888, he sent the poet a letter (dated February 16) from the
      editors of the magazine rejecting the piece: "We have printed a great many
      'words' on Whitman, &amp; can only print 'more' when there is some specific
      occasion for doing so—when he issues a new book, or does something to
      attract general attention to his work" (For this rejection, see Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C., MSS18630, Box 4, Reel 2–3). On , Bucke informed Whitman that he was
      revising his article and was considering either submitting it to <em>Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</em> or withholding it until the
      appearance of William Sloane Kennedy's book on Whitman, when he could include it
      in a notice of that work. On ,
      Bucke was still working on his article and now thought to "make it into a review
      of the new vol." Probably it became "An impromptu criticism" (see Whitman's
      letter to Bucke dated )<a href="#r4">[back]
