      <br></br>Washington, D.C.,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">December 30, 1864.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been constantly hoping to have you here again and now begin to see something
      more
      than a glimmer of fruition. Ashton<sup><a href="#loc.01818_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> has spoken (at my
      instigation) to Mr Otto<sup><a href="#nyp.00196_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> the Assistant Secretary of the
      Department of the Interior in your behalf, and Mr Otto says that if you will write
      a
      letter of application to the Secretary of the Interior, he will endeavor to put you
      in.<sup><a href="#loc.01818_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Now, dear Walt, do this without delay. The object of your writing the letter is to
      get a
      specimen of your hand. Pick out, then, a good pen and write as fairly as you can a
      letter formally applying for a clerkship. Then enclose a copy of this letter to Ashton, so that he
      can follow it in to the Secretary. The <u>first</u> letter you will,
      of course, mail to the Secretary direct.
   </p>
   
   <p>Do this as soon as you can. We shall fetch it this time. I have every confidence that
      you will get a good and an easy berth, a regular income, &amp;c, leaving you time to
      attend to the soldiers, to your poems, &amp;c,—in a word, what Archimedes wanted,
      a place on which to rest the lever.
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall wait anxiously to hear that you have sent on the letters. I have been thinking
      of you constantly for months and have been doing everything I could to secure you
      a
      foothold here. For a long time, deceived (I must think) by Swinton's<sup><a href="#tex.00153_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> pretensions to influence and by his profuse promises, I hoped
      to get you either one of the New York State Agency Assistantships or the place of an Assistant
      Librarian in the Congress Library (the latter would be really a sinecure if the right
      one was got).<sup><a href="#loc.01818_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> But who follows Swinton follows a
      will-of-the-wisp and though I followed him remorselessly, every blessed day for several
      weeks, and gave him neither rest nor peace, as the saying is, I got nothing except
      promises. Since I gave him up, I have been badgering Ashton, who is a man of another
      sort, as what he has done shows. The difficulty was to get the right thing. He secured
      me some little time ago a place in the Post Office for you, but I declined it, because
      I
      thought it was not the proper place for you. I think a desk in the Interior would
      be
      first rate.
   </p>
   
   <p>I told Ashton there was nothing I would not do for him if he would carry this affair
      to
      a safe conclusion. He has been very good and anxious in your behalf. He would have given you a desk in his
      own office if a vacancy had occurred as expected.
   </p>
   
   <p>Don't forget to do as I tell you immediately.</p>
   
   <p>I never answered your letter of September 11th, but, dear Walt, I always think of
      you,
      though I write so seldom and so badly. You are never forgotten. I read your poems
      often,
      I get their meaning more and more, I stand up for them and you, I expound, define,
      defend, vindicate, justify them and you with all the heart and head I have whenever
      occasion demands.
   </p>
   
   <p>I got the Times with your long letter about the Hospital experiences, which I read
      with
      a swelling heart and wet eyes. It was very great and touching to me. I think I could
      mount the tribune for you on that and speak speech which jets fire and drops tears. Only
      it filled me with infinite regrets that there is not a book from you, embodying these
      rich and sad experiences. It would be sure of immortality. No history of our times
      would
      ever be written without it, if written with that wealth of living details you could
      crowd into it. Indeed, it would itself be history.
   </p>
   
   <p>I saw your letter about the prisoners. It was as just as powerful. I have been hearing
      for a fortnight past that it is the Secretary of War's "policy" which prevents exchange,
      and if this is true, I pray from my heart of hearts that it never may be forgotten
      against him. Reddest murder is white to an act like this and its folly is equal to
      its
      crime. It would be a
      demonism of another kind indeed than the Southerners', yet as bad, perhaps worse,
      because sprung from calculation rather than hatred.
   </p>
   
   <p>Such things make one sicken of the world.</p>
   
   <p>I write this letter at intervals between the press of office work, which has driven
      upon
      me in spasms today, but pretty severely when it did come. Any incoherences in it,
      you
      may refer to the obfusticated state which such hurryings have induced in me.
   </p>
   
   <p>Farewell, dear Walt. I hope to hear from you very soon. We are all tolerably well
      at
      home. Eldridge<sup><a href="#loc.00943_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> comes every evening. We often talk of you. On
      Christmas, you were wanted to make the dinner at home perfect. We all spoke of you.
      On
      Thanksgiving it was the
      same. At dinner that day, I said "I wish"—and stopped. "What?"—said
      Nelly.<sup><a href="#loc.01818_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup> "<u>I</u> know," chirped little
      Jeannie, "he wishes Walt was here." Which was true—that <u>was</u> the unuttered wish.
   </p>
   
   <p>Let me hear soon.</p>

      Your loving
      <br></br>W D O'Connor.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived with
      William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later John
      Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington years.
      William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor often complained about the
      various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his death. However, his
      government work was relieved by the presence of Whitman, whom he was to love and
      venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
      vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
      pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
      important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
      those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
      O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
      sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
      first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910], 513). For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see Deshae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01818_n2">1. J. Hubley Ashton, the
      assistant Attorney General, actively interested himself in Whitman's affairs,
      and obtained a position for the poet in his office after Whitman lost his job in
      the Department of the Interior. James Harlan (1820–1899), Secretary of the
      Interior from 1865 to 1866, dismissed Whitman from his second-class clerkship on
      . Harlan apparently took offense
      at the copy of the 1860 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> which Whitman was
      revising and which he kept at his desk. With the help of O'Connor and Ashton,
      Whitman secured a position in the Attorney General's office. The Harlan episode
      led directly to O'Connor's pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00196_n2">2. William T. Otto
      (1816–1905) was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Interior in January,
      1863, and took an active interest in Indian affairs. He resigned from this post
      in 1871, but held various other governmental posts for many years. See also note
      2 to Whitman's letter from 
      .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01818_n3">3. William T. Otto
      (1816–1905) was Assistant Secretary of the Interior. William Douglas
      O'Connor arranged an interview for Whitman with Otto for a clerk position in the
      Bureau of Indian Affairs.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00153_n4">4. William Swinton
      (1833–1892) was war correspondent of the <em>New York
         Times</em>. His hostility to Union generals and his unscrupulous tactics led
      to his suspension as a reporter on July 1, 1864. Whitman did not have a high
      opinion of William's journalism; see his letter from . He was professor of English at the University of
      California from 1869 to 1874. Thereafter he compiled extremely successful
      textbooks, and established the magazine <em>Story-Teller</em>, in
      1883. He was the brother of John Swinton, managing editor of the <em>New York Times</em>; see the letter of  from Walt Whitman to John Swinton.

   <p id="loc.01818_n4">5. John Swinton
      (1829–1901), managing editor of the <em>New York Times</em>,
      frequented Pfaff's beer cellar, where he probably met Whitman. On January 23,
      1874 (Whitman said "1884"), Swinton wrote what the poet termed "almost like a
      love letter": "It was perhaps the very day of the publication of the first
      edition of the 'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of it at a newspaper stand in
      Fulton street, Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it with wonder, and felt that
      here was something that touched on depths of my humanity. Since then you have
      grown before me, grown around me, and grown into me" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      [1906–1996], 9 vols., 1:24). He praised Whitman in the <em>New York Herald</em> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke,
      <em>Walt Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
      36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
      for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <em>New York Sun</em>, and for the next four years he edited the
      weekly labor journal, <em>John Swinton's Paper</em>. When this
      publication folded, he returned to the <em>Sun</em>. See Robert
      Waters, <em>Career and Conversation of John Swinton, Journalist,
         Orator, Economist</em> (Chicago: C.H. Kerr, 1902), and Meyer Berger, <em>The Story of The New York Times, 1851–1951</em> (New
      York: Simon and Schuster, 1951), 250–251.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.00943_n2">6. Charles W. Eldridge was
      one half of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge,
      who put out the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In
      December 1862, on his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg,
      Virginia, Walt Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had
      become a clerk in the office of the army paymaster and eventually obtained a
      desk for Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster. For
