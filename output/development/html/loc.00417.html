      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00417_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> is again very anxious about his boy, his name is Horace G. Tarr,<sup><a href="#loc.00417_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and is Sergeant Major of the 20th Reg. of Connecticut Vol. If by chance you should
      hear anything of him will you please write. His Reg. belonged to the 12th army Corps,
      and I think were in the hottest of the fight. I sent you a letter last week with $14
      in it and another yesterday with $10.<sup><a href="#loc.00417_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Did you get them both? We are all well at home. The rejoicing in New York is sincere
      and almost universal and yet a few, (and yet only a few when compared with the immense city) who try to find some reason why
      Lee should have been whipped. Copperheads are getting out of circulation being laid
      up for a future contingency. Hope to hear from you soon. Dont forget me.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00417_n1">1. Moses Lane
      (1823–82) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00417_n2">2. Horace G. H. Tarr
      (1844–?) had just been promoted from private to sergeant major of Company
      K. His regiment fought at Chancellorsville, Virginia, May 1–5, 1863, but
      he was not injured. Evidently, Tarr became a lifelong friend of Jeff and
      Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
