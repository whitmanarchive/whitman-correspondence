   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>it dont
       seem as if we had been here one whole month<sup><a href="#duk.00470_n11" id="r2">2</a></sup> matt says one month of the
      twelve<sup><a href="#duk.00465_n9" id="r3">3</a></sup> is gone i got your letter
      Walt yesterday with 3 dol
       in all right and very glad to have it i suppose you
      are at mrs grasons
       yet how is the old lady<sup><a href="#duk.00470_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> i suppose she is as usuall
       or you would have written we all remain here yet and i
      suppose we shall for there dont
       seem to be any places and if there was i
      dont
       think i could undergo the mooving
       operations again i like it better here now we have got
      kind of stoed
       away a little more if i had one more room but i might
      as well wish for a whole house so i will be content if i could only rest but that
      seems almost impossible the going up and down stairs tires me more than it ever did
      matty says it tires her too so i think they must be hard stairs the water is no
      where but in the basement and no way to get in the yard but down the basement i tell
      mat i shall be favorable  to water-closets after this) we pay 15 dollars a month about the worth of the
      whole house george<sup><a href="#duk.00425_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> has paid the rent he
      dont
       like it very well here its
       so far for him to come i dont
       know what his ideas are probably he will get married
      who its
       too we dont
       know but he appears to be very much taken with some
      one<sup><a href="#duk.00470_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> i said something to him about it the other day partly in joke and
      partly in earnest he said he dident
       know but he should when he got time he has got to be
      very economicall
       very different from when he was in the army but
      every body changes some for the better and some for the worser)
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr Davis<sup><a href="#duk.00479_n9" id="r7">7</a></sup> is appointed
      chief engineer of the prospect park with a good salary i think now Jeff<sup><a href="#duk.00422_n2" id="r8">8</a></sup> will build on

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00470_n14">1. This letter dates to May
      31, 1866. The date in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand reads "the last day of
      may," and Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1866. Edwin Haviland Miller
      agreed with Bucke's year (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:377). The year 1866 is consistent with Louisa's recent move to 840 Pacific
      Street and with Walt Whitman's boarding with Juliet Grayson.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00470_n11">2. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, their daughters Manahatta
      and Jessie Louisa, and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and her son Edward Whitman had
      moved from their home during the Civil War, at Portland Avenue north of Myrtle,
      to 840 Pacific Street between Washington Avenue and Grand Avenue (see Walt
      Whitman's  letter to Abby H. Price).
      The house was near Prospect Park, on what was then the outer edge of
      Brooklyn.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">3. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00470_n2">4. Juliet Grayson operated the
      boarding house at 468 M Street South, Washington, D.C., where Walt Whitman lived
      between late January 1865 and at least June 1866 (see Walt's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00470_n4">6. George Washington Whitman's
      "some one" is probably Louisa Orr Haslam (1842–1892), called "Loo" or
      "Lou," whom he married in spring 1871.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">7. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">8. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00470_n7">9. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and his wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his practice and
      devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems" (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:90, n. 85).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00470_n8">10. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
      and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00473_n8">11. Mary Mix lived with her
      daughter, Juliet Grayson, who operated the boarding house at 468 M Street South,
      Washington, D.C., where Walt Whitman lived between late January 1865 and at
      least June 1866. After her daughter's death on January 7, 1867, which Walt
      Whitman reported to his mother in his  letter, Mix left Washington.<a href="#r11">[back]
