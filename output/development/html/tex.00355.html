   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00355_n1">1. In his Commonplace Book
      Whitman noted sending a circular to Platt on October 22, but on the following
      page, on Platt's calling card, he wrote: "Oct 23—Letter from, <em>very warm ab't poems</em>, &amp; asking ab't books—I
      sent circular . . . (I sent the letter to Dr Bucke)." Platt (1853–1917)
      was a New York attorney, a Baconian, and an early biographer of Whitman (1904).
      The poet sent the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> on October 27
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
