      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The MS. to—hand<sup><a href="#loc.02902_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>I am very glad indeed, &amp; thankful, for all the capital suggestions &amp;
      amendments you have made. I have followed them all, or am doing it. I have a good
      many little additions to make myself—things which the close work of
      concordance-making suggested to me. I will cut out everything you advise. As
      to Ballou<sup><a href="#n4106" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; Scovel,<sup><a href="#loc.03298_n10" id="r3">3</a></sup> I will cut out nearly
      everything of Ballou's retaining only a little to put with large quotations from
      Scovel's article. I can improve that personal chapter very much by working it over,
      smoothing down &amp; melding things together more. 
   </p>
   
   <p>How wd that MS—"Of That Blithe Throat" &amp;c—You gave me, do for a fac-simile page
      to put into the 
      Bibliography where I speak of your typographical finesse &amp;c? Or wd you prefer 
      to send me a clean draft of something in case the publishers
      thought best to give the fac-simile? People like to see the erasures &amp;c I
      believe. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I have thought that I might perhaps get more from Chatto &amp; Windus if I guaranteed
      them for three years against the republication of the book in this country. I am
      going to copyright it, here right away, or very soon. What wd you say to this—guaranteeing
      the British publisher the market? 
   </p>
   
   <p> An error in L. of G. </p>
   
   <p>By the way I suppose of course you have noticed that the characters "§ 9" of the
      Salut are by mistake omitted in L. of G.<sup><a href="#loc.02902_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I have a nice letter form Scovel wh. I shall answer. </p>
   
   <p>The hot weather has [
      <span class="unclear">worked?</span>]
       on me a
      little too. 
   </p>

       As ever dear Walt 
      <br></br>W.S. Kennedy
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I will omit Conway<sup><a href="#n4105" id="r5">5</a></sup>  &amp; Goldsmith entirely, &amp; not sorry to do it. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p> If Morse<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r6">6</a></sup> makes a bust satisfactory to you, I shall have
      picture of it in the book.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4106">2. William H. Ballou (1857–1937)
      was a journalist and natural scientist who falsely reported in the Cleveland <em>Leader and Herald</em> in 1885 that Whitman was about to go to
      England to visit Tennyson; he conducted two interviews with the poet in 1885 and
      1886. See Ballou's interview with Whitman of <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00517.html">June 28, 1885</a> for the <em>Leader and Herald</em> and
      his interview with Whitman of <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00651.html">June 12, 1886</a> for the <em>Chicago Daily

   <p id="loc.03298_n10">3. James Matlack Scovel
      (1833–1904) worked as a layer in Camden before entering the New Jersey
      legislature during the Civil War and becoming a colonel in 1863. He campaigned
      actively for Horace Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S.
      Treasury during Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to
      Scovel's home for Sunday breakfast. For a description of these breakfasts, see
      <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed. William Sloane
      Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel, see George R.
      Prowell's <em>The History of Camden County</em>, New Jersey

      was a Unitarian minister who lived in England from the 1860s until 1885, where
      he served as a supporter of Whitman and wrote frequently about the poet.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n0862">6. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
