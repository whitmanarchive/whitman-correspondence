   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="nyp.00420_n2">2. Whitman delivered his
      "Death of Abraham Lincoln" lecture at a banquet of the "Pythian Club" on
      February 2, for which he received $30 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Folger
      McKinsey (1866–1950) was responsible for the invitation. McKinsey, then a
      railroad clerk in Philadelphia, began to call on Whitman in 1884, as indicated
      by his letter of  and the reference to his
      occasional visits in Whitman's Commonplace Book on June 17. In 1885 McKinsey
      became the editor of the Elkton (Md.) <em>Cecil Democrat</em>, in
      which he printed an interview with the poet on December 12. On March 12, 1886,
      the newspaper termed Whitman's lecture "a failure." See Rollo G. Silver, <em>N &amp; Q</em>, 170 (1936), 190–191, and Ernest J.
      Moyne, "Walt Whitman and Folger McKinsey," <em>Delaware
         Notes</em>, 29 (1956), 103–117. Later McKinsey became the editor of the
      Baltimore <em>Sun</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
