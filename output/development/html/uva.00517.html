   </p>
   
   <p>I have your card of 25 May<sup><a href="#uva.00517_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Last week Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r2">2</a></sup> came
      to town and I spent a day with him at Alfred Withers' (do you recollect him at
      London) in Hyde Park &amp;c. We had a good talk and dinner together down
      town—Then last Sunday I spent most of the day and dined at Herbert Gilchrists<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      and Carpenter was there. I am now making a few short visits in the country, shall
      return to London 21 and sail 30th—expect to see you about 15, 16 or 17 July
      and want you to be ready to go to Canada with me so as to avoid the heat of August
      and September in Camden—you may go home again as soon as you like after 1 oct.
      but I must insist on your going with me for the two hot months—Now please do
      not think of refusing to go but make all necessary arrangements and we will move
      Northward as soon as convenient after I get across the water—My health has
      improved quite a good deal and I trust it will keep on the same tack<sup><a href="#uva.00517_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0141b">2. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
