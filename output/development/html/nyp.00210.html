      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter came safe, &amp; was indeed welcome. I will leave out "orgies" since you dislike
      it so much. I have been much delayed in the printing—but I believe they have now fairly
      got to work, &amp; will go on expeditiously. I found a printer, Chapin,<sup><a href="#nyp.00210_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> 24 Beekman st., who was getting new type of the kind I wanted, &amp; I waited for him—He
      engages to have the composition &amp; presswork done in from two to three weeks. It will
      be typographically about the same as Drum-Taps, only about five times as thick—Upon
      calling on Huntington &amp; Son,<sup><a href="#nyp.00210_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> I found that Drum-Taps has sold somewhat better than I anticipated—I was treated
      very courteously, &amp; they promised to advertise D. T. &amp; push it this fall—I did not
      say any thing about the coming new Leaves—but may propose to Messrs. H. to be the
      agents before I return—I shall probably return about the 12th of September—
   </p>
   
   <p>When I arrived here, I found my mother &amp; the rest lately moved (again) in a large
      old house out in Brooklyn suburbs, &amp; in a good deal of confusion &amp;c.—Mother was not
      well, &amp; seemed generally fagged out—But since then things have come round somewhat—Mother
      has improved a good deal—yesterday felt quite like herself again—I spend three or
      four hours there every day—Jeff is very well, &amp; George pretty well—in the latter I
      can see that campaigning &amp; Danville prison have left their mark<sup><a href="#nyp.00210_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I am stopping at Mrs. Price's, am most pleasantly situated in personal comforts,
      &amp;c.—Mrs. P. has asked much about you—hopes to see you yet—The weather here is really
      perfect—I have been to the Central Park, had a long ride &amp; foot ramble—the place is
      probably looking its best just now—I go out on Broadway occasionally &amp; take a walk,
      or a ride on the omnibus—I am received by the drivers with renewed rapture—it is more
      marked than ever.
   </p>
   
   <p>I havn't learned any thing worth mentioning about literary persons or doings here. I doubt
      whether the article will be accepted in the Galaxy<sup><a href="#nyp.00210_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup>—don't know who edits it—I send my love to John Burroughs<sup><a href="#nyp.00210_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup>—Also the same to Charles Eldridge<sup><a href="#nyp.00210_n8" id="r7">7</a></sup>—I hope to be able to write to Nelly<sup><a href="#nyp.00210_n9" id="r8">8</a></sup>—I wish you when you write to say I send my love to her. And now for a while, my dear
      friend, Farewell.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
      John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp;
      Eldridge in 1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an
      intelligent man who deserved something better than the various governmental
      clerical posts he was to hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship,
      however, was relieved by the presence of Whitman whom he was to love and
      venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
      vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
      pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
      important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
      those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
      O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
      sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
      first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910] pp. 513). For more
      on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>.

      written on May 31, 1866: "he has got to be very economical, very different from
      when he was in the army, but every body changes, some for the better and some
      for the worser" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books,
      Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). She also had noted that "he
      appears to be very much taken with some one," and, on June 7, 1866, "i think
      george will get married" (Trent Collection). George, however, did not marry
      until 1871.<a href="#r4">[back]

      Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77] 1:335–336). When W. C. Church wrote on
      June 13 to O'Connor (Charles E. Feinberg Collection), requesting an article, he
      suggested that the magazine publish Burroughs's "Walt Whitman and His
      'Drum-Taps,'" which appeared in <em>The Galaxy</em>, 2 (<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00061.html">December 1, 1866</a>), 606–615.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00210_n7">6. John Burroughs
      (1837-1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, DC, in 1864, even though
      Burroughs had frequented Pfaff's beer cellar, where he consistently defended
      Whitman's poetry, in 1862. After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman
      commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs
      was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the correspondence between the two
      men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would
      write several books involving or devoted to Whitman's work: <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Notes on Walt Whitman as
         Poet and Person</em> (1867), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896),
      and <em>Accepting the Universe</em> (1924). For more information
