   </p>
   
   
   <p>Following an impulse of the moment, I have just mailed to you two little books of
      mine—writing this note to introduce them—and taking permission to personally offer,
      
      as it were, from America true respects &amp; love.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01713_n1">1. This draft letter is
      endorsed, "To Carlyle | with Dem Vistas | &amp; Am Inst. poem."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01713_n2">2. Perhaps Whitman sent the
      poems to Carlyle, who was not one of his admirers, because of Burroughs' letter
      from London on October , written after his
      recent visit to Carlyle: "I am sure you would like him &amp; that he would like
      you."<a href="#r2">[back]
