   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your affectionate letter of March 30 has reached me, and has given me much
      comfort—for our acquaintance in this city at the last of the war, &amp; our
      being with each other so closely those two or three days &amp; nights before you
      went away, have left a loving remembrance of you which will never be effaced. I am
      well as usual—still work in this office—still board at the same house
      in M Street—&amp; I suppose hold my own generally about the same as when we
      were together—I suppose you have progressed a good deal &amp; I want to hear
      all about it—everything about you &amp; your fortunes will be
      interesting—&amp; the sight of you, dear friend, &amp; to have you with me
      again, would be more welcome than all. I will not write a long letter this
      time—but send you my love—&amp; charge you to write more regularly in
      future.
   </p>

      Walt Whitman began his correspondence with soldier Byron Sutherland on .<br><br>
      Sutherland was now teaching at Jamestown, N. Y. In reply to Walt Whitman's
      request for further information about his life, the former soldier observed
      on : "You remember me in 1865 a
      green vain (?) lad of Eighteen—without, even, an imperfect knowledge
      of the rudimentary English branches, I came home from Washington and applied
      myself, as soon as possible, to school and to study…My life since we
      parted that July day upon the Treasury steps, has been one of hard work and
      little recreation—I find on looking back to that time, that I am not
      so pure or trusting—that the world isnt quite so fair and beautiful as
      it seemed then—That the world is not precisely a green pasture for 
      unsophistocated
      
       human lambs to skip in—That I like dreaming less, and work
      or excitement better—That I have lost a great deal of Ambition, and
      gained a like quantity of stupidity—That I dont know nearly so much as
      I once supposed I did."<a href="#r2">[back]
