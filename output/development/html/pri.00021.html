      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of April 19<sup><a href="#pri.00021_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> both rec'd—with draft on Drexel &amp; Co. for £28.4—most acceptable. The books, according to list
      sent, will now be prepared, packed, &amp; sent, (together with your &amp; Mrs. Gilchrist's
      copies, which have been waiting) probably to London express, of which I will advise
      you more explicitly by letter to follow this probably within two or three days.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I repeat what I have already written you—<u>accept all subscriptions</u>—all will be supplied, 
      upon remittance—(I am already putting another small edition to press)<sup><a href="#pri.00021_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—the price will invariably be $10 the set—$5 each Vol. can be had separately, 
      or together, as wanted—Each will contain portraits &amp; my autograph. The Two, <u>Leaves</u> and <u>Rivulets</u> 
      comprise my complete works (the latter Vol. as you see, includes <u>Memoranda of the War</u> as a constituent part.)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I do not approve of Mr Conway's letter of April 4<sup><a href="#pri.00021_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—it was unneeded, hurtful to my case,<sup><a href="#pri.00021_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; join'd with his allusions to the matter in his public American correspondence, an insult
      
      to Mr Buchanan, through me<sup><a href="#pri.00021_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—as such I decidedly resent &amp; disavow it—Every point in B's March 11 
      letter to the <u>News</u>, is well taken, &amp; <u>true without exception</u>—particularly 
      all about the American critics, publishers, editors, "poets" &amp;c—even what he says
      about my "impoverishment" is much, 
      <u>much nearer the truth</u> than Mr Conways and Lord Houghton's rose-colored illusion varnish—if Mr C. 
      instead of intellectual possessed sympathetic delicacy &amp; insight (I don't think he
      possesses either) he could have 
      divined better about me &amp; my affairs, not only now here in Camden, but times past
      in the beginning.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>I send my love &amp; thanks to W B Scott<sup><a href="#pri.00021_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—I shall try to write a line to him, to C W Reynell, to J L Warren, to A G Dew-Smith,<sup><a href="#pri.00021_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> &amp; one or two others, soon as I can. I heartily thank my good friends of the <u>Secularist</u>. 
      I am glad you printed off, &amp; furnish'd friends with copies of my letter of March 17—upon reading it in print, 
      I find it exactly describes the situation, &amp; my wishes—&amp; I reëndorse it—(if you have
      any copies spare, 
      send me two or three more in next paper you send.)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The drafting on Drexel &amp; Co. the Philadelphia bankers, is perfectly convenient to
      me.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am feeling pretty comfortable as I write—have been out a little nearly every day
      for a week—some days across the river here, 
      the broad Delaware—This is one of my good mornings (it is now between 8 and 9) have
      finished my breakfast, coffee, 
      Graham bread &amp; mutton chop—good night's sleep, last night.—occupy myself two or three
      hours every day 
      when not too ill, with my <u>book business</u>, letters, &amp;c—also with <u>the baby</u> boy, 
      my brother's 6 months infant, very fine &amp; bright, (of course)—takes much of my time,
      &amp; is a delightful diversion 
      to me—the young one knows me <u>so well</u>, &amp; is always happy when tended by me—
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">&amp; so, 
      my dear friend, good bye for this time—&amp; God bless you &amp; yours.
      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pri.00021_n1">1. Rossetti's letter is not known, but the
      receipt of money is noted in Whitman's Commonplace Book. On  Rossetti had written to Whitman to inquire
      whether <em>Leaves of Grass</em> was available at less than £1.
      Either Whitman's reply is not extant, or the second paragraph of this letter was
      intended as an answer.<a href="#r1">[back]

      passage in his draft: "(in diplomacy as some one has said, <em>the
         utterance markedly malapropos or ill-tempered</em> is worse than the worst
      untruth)."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00021_n5">5. Whitman did not include the following from
      the draft letter: "Buchanan stands to me as a fervid, affectionate &amp;
      reverential friend and advocate."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00021_n6">6. William Bell Scott (1811–1890), an
      English poet and painter, became acquainted with <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> through Thomas Dixon; see the letter from Whitman to Dixon of
      . Whitman sent the two 1876
      volumes on May 18 and <em>Memoranda During the War</em> on June 14
