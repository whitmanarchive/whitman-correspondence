      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend and master—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am at last able to send you the lecture, which I have now got published together
      with another by a friend of mine here, delivered before the same society. I hope it
      may do something, however little, towards making the 
      L. of G.
      
       known here. If any American bookseller would like it, which is not, I
      suppose, very probable, he must write to the publisher, Tittman. We are selling it
      for 1 mark, which
      = I think a quarter of a dollar, about. I have sent a copy to D<u>r</u> Bucke. Would you kindly
      transmit one to W. O'Connor? whose address I don't know. As to D<u>r</u>
      Knortz, I fear it
      would be quite impossible to carry on the work of translation with him at such a
      distance. I have appended to my lecture a 
      transl.
      
       of the Song of the Answerer, &amp; in getting this translation into final form, I was
      astonished at the amount of discussion it gave rise to, between myself &amp; a German
      friend who
      looked over my proofs, showing that it would be quite impossible to carry on the work
      of
      translation with another person across the Atlantic. Besides I greatly doubt if he
      would go into it. His admiration for the 
      L. of G.
      
       is decidedly qualified by objection to your system of punctuation, use of
      participles, &amp;c., which matters seem to bother him more than they ought. His
      translations are sympathetic &amp; effective for the poetic passages—but when
      he converts a word whose meaning is a little remote or unusual, he <u>evades</u> the difficulty. For instance, here is his rendering
      of a passage from the Mystic Trumpeter ([
      <span class="unclear">st.?</span>]
       5).
   </p>
   
   <span class="indent">—Blow again, Trumpeter! Take for thy theme</span><br>
   <span class="indent">The All-encloser, the Redeemer and Orderer—</span><br>
   <span class="indent">Love, pulse of the All, of sorrows &amp; of joys,</span><br>
   
   
   
   <span class="indent">The heart of man and woman;</span><br>
   <span class="indent">No other theme than love—immortalizing, all-embracing, self-surrendering
      Love.</span><br>
   
   
   <p>On the whole I begin to fear that a complete translation is not feasible, at present.
      But I might possibly reckon on assistance enough to produce good renderings of, say,
      8 or ten of the longer poems, which might then be published in a small book—&amp; perhaps
      pave the way for something more: What would you think of this?
   </p>
   
   <p>I am sending McKay a copy of the lectures &amp; am asking him that we have a copy of the
      
      L. of G.
      
       with broad margins, if he has got one. The 1882 reprint is not very
      satisfactory in this way to me at least, as I like to make notes &amp; references in
      the book.
   </p>
   
   <p>Things are going badly in Ireland. The [
      <span class="unclear">Gov<u>t</u>
         
         ?</span>]
       is putting down meetings (of the National party) right &amp;
      left, for no reason, &amp; the people are getting very exasperated. I had hoped
      great things from
      Gladstone's government, but that accursed Egyptian war opened my eyes finally to the
      mixture of hypocrisy &amp; injustice which lie at the root of English policy. If you
      could only live in Ireland for a while, &amp; see this sensitive, keen sighted, but
      helpless nation dragged about in the clumsy lurches of English
      Opportunism—seeing it all, knowing its own mind &amp; ideal but condemned to
      incapacity for realizing it,—you would wish us God speed. And yet I did not
      always see my way to these views myself. Now I must close—I was very glad to hear
      of your health &amp; pleasant circumstances, &amp;c. in your last letter. May this one find
      it all unchanged.
