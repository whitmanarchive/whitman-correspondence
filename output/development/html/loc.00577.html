      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter came duly to hand, we have not answered
      previously because we have had nothing particular to say, nor indeed have we now any
      further than that the English periodicals appear to be waking up—that notice in
      the Saturday Review is quite a pungent one<sup><a href="#loc.00577_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>. The praise in
      regard to the mechanical execution of the book is great, from that source. It is more
      apparent however every day that a less pretentious Edition to sell at $1.00 must be
      the
      one to be universally sold—we approve heartily of your idea in regard to a change
      in this respect—the fine Ed must be put up to 1.50 more would be sold at that
      price than 125 we believe, because when you make a difference in price people all
      at
      once see a difference in quality which they were blind  to before<sup><a href="#loc.00577_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>. If you make a book too good for
      the money—you ask for it, you degrade it at once. People <em>do</em>
      like to pay the cost of what they buy.
   </p>
   
   <p>Still it is very evident that it was the best policy to insure the fine editions in
      the
      style in which they have appeared. It has commanded an attention and respect which
      we
      otherwise should not have obtained in certain quarters. &nbsp;Have you seen the notice
      in the
      Literary Gazette—it is regular "out and outer."<sup><a href="#loc.00577_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> As I
      write I am informed that the Spectator has noticed it but I have not seen it<sup><a href="#loc.00577_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>.
   </p>
   
   <p>As soon as we get any thing worth while we will report it as an advertisement in the
      N.Y. papers<sup><a href="#loc.00577_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup>.
   </p>
   
   <p>About Fall we should make an extensive push in the advertisement way. We are now
      receiving 300 applications a day for Imprints but the orders by mail do not seem to
      come
      in much yet—probably owing to the
      season of the year which is more adopted to haying than reading. We shall probably
      dispose of all the second Edition before the close of next month and we think that
      we
      had better print it cheaper for the next Edition, with a small Edition of the other
      style with the addition at 1.50.
   </p>
   
   <p>Let us hear from you further on this point—we do not think favorably of paper
      covers for a dollar book—nor paper covers for any kind—Let it be flexible
      cloth or cloth with boards.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thayer and Eldridge was
      the Boston publishing firm responsible for the third edition of Walt Whitman's
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00577_n2">1. For this July 7, 1860
      article in the <em>Saturday Review</em> see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1860/anc.00044.html">LEAVES OF GRASS</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00577_n3">2. The <em>Saturday Review</em> described the 1860 <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> as "a book evidently intended to lie on the tables of the
      wealthy," and quipped that "No poor man could afford it, and it is too bulky for
      its possessor to get it into his pocket or to hide it away in a corner." Thayer
      and Eldridge cite this review to demonstrate the demand for a "less,
      pretentious" edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, one which would
      be printed in "flexible cloth" and sold for $1; with the proposed release of
      this cheaper <em>Leaves of Grass</em>,the price of the "fine"
      edition would be raised from $1.25 to $1.50.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.00577_n4">3. For this July 7, 1860
      article in the <em>Literary Gazette</em>, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1860/anc.00043.html">Leaves of Grass</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00577_n5">4. Thayer and Eldridge refer to
      a July 14, 1860 article in the <em>Spectator</em>. See "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1860/anc.00046.html">LEAVES OF GRASS</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.00577_n6">5. For an example of a
      periodical review that Thayer and Eldridge reprinted as an advertisement see the
      <em>New-York Saturday Press</em> (June 30, 1860), 3.
      Underneath an advertisement for <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, Thayer
      and Eldridge reprint a large excerpt from a New York <em>New York
         Illustrated News</em> review written by George S. Philips ("January
      Searle"). This advertisement takes up an entire column in the <em>Saturday Press</em>.<a href="#r5">[back]
