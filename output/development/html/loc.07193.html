   <p>I am inclined to say <em>yes</em> to Mr McClure's proposition. Will a
      week or ten days from now do, to send in the piece, if at all? Please send me Mr.
      McClure's address, as I sh'd like to treat with <em>him</em>.<sup><a href="#loc.07193_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07193_n1">1. On June 25 Whitman sent
      McClure "The Dying Veteran," for which he received $25 (see letter from Whitman
      to S. S. McClure, ). The poem appeared
      in <em>McClure's Magazine</em> in June, in the Springfield <em>Daily Republican</em> on July 11, and in the <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> (London) on July 9.<a href="#r1">[back]
