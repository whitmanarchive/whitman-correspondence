   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00435_n7">1. This letter dates to March
      5, 1865. On an accompanying slip of paper held in the Trent Collection (not
      reproduced here) that is bound with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt, Richard Maurice Bucke
      dated this letter February 26 or March 2, 1863. Bucke's date is incorrect, and
      he probably erred because he associated George Washington Whitman's release from
      imprisonment with his imminent arrival to Brooklyn. After his release from the
      Confederate Military Prison at Danville, George arrived at Annapolis, Maryland,
      on February 24, and he continued to Brooklyn several days later. See Jerome M.
      Loving, ed., <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington
         Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975),
      134–135. His one-month furlough, which expired on April 4, would have
      begun on March 4, 1865. George arrived in Brooklyn on March 5, 1865, a Sunday,
      and this letter dates to the evening of his arrival.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]

      has not been identified.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00435_n2">4. Samuel M. Pooley was a
      soldier in the Fifty-first New York Volunteers. In his notes on the Fifty-first
      regiment, Walt Whitman wrote that Pooley was "born in Cornwall, Eng.
      1836—struck out &amp; came to America when 14—has lived mostly in
      Buffalo[,] learnt ship joining—left Buffalo in the military service U.S.
      June, 1861—came out as private—was made 2d Lieut at South Mountain.
      Made Captain Aug. 1864—got a family in Buffalo" (Manuscripts of Walt
      Whitman in the Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and
      Manuscript Library, Yale University).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00435_n9">5. See George Washington
      Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman. Louisa wrote on the verso of the letter from George, which she
      forwarded, "Walter i should have sent you this letter from george but thought of
      course you knew all about his arrival at Anapolis i saw his name in the times
      with 500 others arrived)" (see her 
      letter to Walt).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00435_n4">7. The nickname "Sis" refers to
      Jessie Louisa Whitman (1863–1957), the daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Jessie and her sister Manahatta "Hattie" were both favorites of
      their uncle Walt. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman reported on  that "sis is much better she has been down stairs to
      day and plays about she has lost some of her fat but will regain it again." The
      nickname "Sis" was given first to Manahatta but was passed to her younger sister
      Jessie Louisa when Manahatta became "Hattie."<a href="#r7">[back]
