   <p>Yours of 17<u>th</u><sup><a href="#loc.07566_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> came to hand
      yesterday and I left it over till today that I might answer it at leisure. That is
      grand news about Kennedy's<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r3">3</a></sup> book, that Wilson<sup><a href="#loc.03316_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> will really publish it and at once,<sup><a href="#loc.07724_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> so it is that the German translation is actually being
      printed at last.<sup><a href="#loc.07240_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> I shall be very glad to get the
      Springfield Rep<u>n</u> con<u>g</u> the
      "Whittier, Whitman &amp; Emma Lazarus" criticism<sup><a href="#loc.07566_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup>—please do not forget to send it when you can spare it. No, I have received
      no German papers of any kind from any body for a long time, where are they? If still
      comeatable send them.<sup><a href="#loc.07566_n6" id="r8">8</a></sup> [—] We have, thank goodness,
      a change in the weather, it has been blowing from the East for about twenty-four
      hours and now (as a natural consequence) it has begun to snow—and it is coming
      down at a great rate before a driving cold East wind out of a dark gray sky which
      looks as if it was made of solid snow banks. If we have no disastros change (such
      as
      a shift of the wind) we shall have good sleighing tomorrow morning. All well and all
      quiet here, annual Ball getting pretty near now, a week from thursday—i.e.
      1<u>st</u>—soon after that I hope to see you, but we
      have had no word of our patents<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r9">9</a></sup> yet and there may still be some hitch for all I can
      tell—but I hope not

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07566_n1">1. Horace Traubel's note,
      "See Notes, | Jan. 22d '89," appears in the upper left-hand corner of the first
      recto. The reference is to Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.2.html">Tuesday, January 22, 1889</a>. This letter is not listed by
      Miller.<a href="#r1">[back]

      Bucke of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">3. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03316_n2">4. Frederick W. Wilson was a
      member of the Glasgow firm of Wilson &amp; McCormick that published the 1883
      British edition of <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em>.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07724_n4">5. Kennedy had reported in a
      letter to Whitman of  that
      Frederick W. Wilson was willing to publish his study of Whitman. Kennedy's
      manuscript eventually became two books, <em>Reminiscences of Walt
         Whitman</em> (1896) and <em>The Fight of a Book for the
         World</em> (1926). Alexander Gardner (1821–1882) of Paisley, Scotland,
      a publisher who reissued a number of books by and about Whitman, ultimately
      published <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> in 1896 after a
      long and contentious battle with Kennedy over editing the book.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07240_n2">6. <em>Grashalme</em>, the first book-length German translation of Whitman's
      poetry, was published in 1889, translated by Thomas William Hazen Rolleston and
      Karl Knortz.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07566_n5">7. Bucke is referring to an unsigned review in
      the Springfield <em>Daily Republican</em> of January 15, 1889. Whitman
      thought the author was Franklin B. Sanborn; see his letter to Bucke of .<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07566_n6">8. The German newspapers
      had been sent to Whitman by Karl Knortz. They contain a brief note on Whitman in
      <em>Germania</em> (Steubenville, Ohio), which Traubel
      translated for Whitman (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.77.html">Wednesday, January 16, 1889</a>); and Knortz's report of a Whitman
      lecture in <em>Bhan Frei</em> from September 18, 1886 (See the letter from Whitman to Knortz of  and Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.76.html">Tuesday, January 15, 1889</a>).<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="loc.07230_n2">9. Bucke and his brother-in-law
      William John Gurd were designing a gas and fluid meter to be patented in Canada
      and sold in England.<a href="#r9">[back]
