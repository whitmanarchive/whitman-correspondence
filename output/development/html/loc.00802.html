      <br></br><br></br>Dear son &amp; comrade,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.00802_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> | &amp; all my dear comrades in the hospital,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I sit down this pleasant Sunday forenoon intending to write you all a good stout letter,
      to try to amuse you as I am not able at present to visit you, like I did—yet what
      I shall write about I hardly know until I get started—but, my dear comrades, I wish
      to help you pass away the time, for a few minutes any how—I am now home at my mother's
      in Brooklyn, N Y—I am in good health as ever &amp; eat my rations without missing one
      time—Lew, I wish you was here with me, &amp; I wish my dear comrade Elijah Fox<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> in Ward G was here with me—but perhaps he is on his way to Wisconsin—Lewy, I came
      through from Washington to New York by day train, 2d Nov., had a very pleasant trip,
      every thing went lovely, &amp; I got home in the evening between 8 and 9—Next morning
      I went up to the polls bright &amp; early—I suppose it is not necessary to tell you how
      I voted—we have gained a great victory in this city—it went union this time, though
      it went democratic strong only a year ago, &amp; for many years past—&amp; all through the
      state the election was a very big thing for the union—I tell you the copperheads got
      flaxed out handsomely<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—indeed these late elections are about as great a victory for us as if we had flaxed
      General Lee himself, &amp; all his men—&amp; as for personal good will I feel as if I could
      have more for Lee or any of his fighting men, than I have for the northern copperheads—
   </p>
   
   <p>Lewy, I was very glad to get your letter of the 5th—I want you to tell Oscar Cunningham<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> in your ward that I sent him my love &amp; he must try to keep up good courage while
      he is confined there with his wound. Lewy, I want you to give my love to Charley Cate<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; all the boys in Ward K, &amp; to Benton<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> if he is [there still]—I wish you would go in Ward C and see James S Stilwell,<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> &amp; also Thomas Carson<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> in same ward, &amp; Chambers<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> that lays next to him, &amp; tell them I sent them my love. Give Carson this letter to
      read if he wishes it. Tell James Stilwell I have writ from here to his folks at Comac,
      L. I., &amp; it may be I shall go down there next week on the L I railroad; &amp; let him
      have this letter to read if he wishes it—Tell Manvill Winterstein<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup> that lays next to him in Ward C that I send him my love, &amp; I hope his wound is healing
      good. Lew, I wish you to go in Ward B and tell a young cavalry man, his first name
      is Edwin,<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n12" id="r12">12</a></sup> he is wounded in the right arm, that I sent him my love, &amp; on the opposite side a
      young man named Charley<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n13" id="r13">13</a></sup> wounded in left hand, &amp; Jennings,<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n14" id="r14">14</a></sup> &amp; also a young man I love that lays now up by the door just above Jennings, that
      I sent them all my love. So, Lew, you see I am giving you a good round job, with so
      many messages—but I want you to do them all, dear son, &amp; leave my letter with each
      of the boys that wish it, to read for themselves—tell Miss Gregg<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n15" id="r15">15</a></sup> in Ward A that I send my love to Pleasant Borley,<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n16" id="r16">16</a></sup> if he is still there, &amp; if so I hope it will be God's will that he will live &amp; get
      strong to go home yet—I send my love to little Billy,<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n17" id="r17">17</a></sup> the Ohio boy in Ward A, &amp; to Miss Gregg herself—&amp; if Mrs Doolittle is in Ward B,
      please ask her to tell the boys in the ward I sent them my love, &amp; to her too, &amp; give
      her this letter some evening to read to the boys, &amp; one of these days I will come
      back &amp; read to them myself—&amp; the same to Mrs Southwick in Ward H, if she wishes to
      read it to the boys for my sake.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Lew, I wish you would go in Ward G &amp; find a very dear friend of mine in bed 11, Elijah
      D Fox, if he is still there. Tell him I sent him my best love, &amp; that I make reckoning
      of meeting him again, &amp; that he must not forget me, though that I know he never will—I
      want to hear how he is, &amp; whether he has got his papers through yet—Lewy, I wish you
      would go to him first &amp; let him have this letter to read if he is there—Lewy, I would
      like you to give my love to a young man named Burns in Ward I, &amp; to all the boys in
      Ward I—&amp; indeed in every ward, from A to K inclusive, &amp; all through the hospital,
      as I find I cannot particularize without being tedious—so I send my love sincerely
      to each &amp; all, for every sick &amp; wounded soldier is dear to me as a son or brother,
      &amp; furthermore every man that wears the union uniform &amp; sticks to it like a man, is
      to me a dear comrade, &amp; I will do what I can for him though it may not be much—&amp; I
      will add that my mother &amp; all my folks feel just the same about it, &amp; would show it
      by their works too when they can—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, dear comrades, what shall I tell you to pass away the time? I am going around
      quite a great deal, more than I really desire to. Two or three nights ago I went to
      the N Y Academy of Music, to the Italian opera.<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n18" id="r18">18</a></sup> I suppose you know that is a performance, a play, all in music &amp; singing, in the
      Italian language, very sweet &amp; beautiful. There is a large company of singers &amp; a
      large band, altogether two or three hundred. It is in a splendid great house, four
      or five tiers high, &amp; a broad parquette on the main floor. The opera here now has some of the greatest singers in the world—the
      principal lady singer (her name is Medori) has a voice that would make you hold your
      breath with wonder &amp; delight, it is like a miracle—no mocking bird nor the clearest
      flute can begin with it—besides it is [a] very rich &amp; strong voice—&amp; besides she is a tall &amp; handsome lady, &amp; her actions
      are so graceful as she moves about the stage, playing her part. Boys, I must tell
      you just one scene in the opera I saw—things have worked so in the piece that this
      lady is compelled, although she tries very hard to avoid it, to give a cup of poisoned
      wine to her lover—the king her husband forces her to do it—she pleads hard, but her
      husband threatens to take both their lives (all this is in singing &amp; music, very fine)—so
      the lover is brought in as a prisoner, &amp; the king pretends to pardon him &amp; make up,
      &amp; asks the young man to drink a cup of wine, &amp; orders the lady to pour it out. The
      lover drinks it, then the king gives her &amp; him a look, &amp; smiles &amp; walks off the stage.
      And now came as good a piece of performance as I ever saw in my life. The lady as
      soon as she saw that her husband was really gone, she sprang to her lover, clutched
      him by the arm, &amp; poured out the greatest singing you ever heard—it poured like a
      raging river more than any thing else I could compare it to—she tells him he is poisoned—he
      tries to inquire &amp;c and hardly knows what to make of it—she breaks in, trying to pacify
      him, &amp; explain &amp;c—all this goes on very rapid indeed, &amp; the band accompanying—she
      quickly draws out from her bosom a little vial, to neutralize the poison, then the
      young man in his desperation abuses her &amp; tells her perhaps it is to poison him still
      more as she has already poisoned him once—this puts her in such agony, she begs &amp;
      pleads with him to take the antidote at once before it is too late—her voice is so
      wild &amp; high it goes through one like a knife, yet it is delicious—she holds the little
      vial to his mouth with one hand &amp; with the other springs open a secret door in the
      wall, for him to escape from the palace—he swallows the antidote, &amp; as she pushes
      him through the door, the husband returns with some armed guards, but she slams the
      door to, &amp; stands back up against the door, &amp; her arms spread wide open across it, one fist clenched,
      &amp; her eyes glaring like a wild cat, so they dare not touch her—&amp; that ends the scene.
      Comrades, recollect all this is in singing &amp; music, &amp; lots of it too, on a big scale,
      in the band, every instrument you can think of, &amp; the best players in the world, &amp;
      sometimes the whole band &amp; the whole men's chorus &amp; women's chorus all putting on
      the steam together—&amp; all in a vast house, light as day, &amp; with a crowded audience
      of ladies &amp; men. Such singing &amp; strong rich music always give me the greatest pleasure—&amp;
      so the opera is the only amusement I have gone to, for my own satisfaction, for last
      ten years.
   </p>
   
   <p>But, my dear comrades, I will now tell you something about my own folks—home here
      there is quite a lot of us—my father is not living—my dear mother is very well indeed
      for her age, which is 67—she is cheerful &amp; hearty, &amp; still does all her light housework
      &amp; cooking—She never tires of hearing about the soldiers, &amp; I sometimes think she is
      the greatest patriot I ever met, one of the old stock—I believe she would cheerfully
      give her life for the Union, if it would avail any thing—and the last mouthful in
      the house to any union soldier that needed it<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n19" id="r19">19</a></sup>—then I have a very excellent sister-in-law—she has two fine young ones—so I am very
      happy in the women &amp; family arrangements. Lewy, the brother I mentioned as sick, lives
      near here, he is very poorly indeed, &amp; I fear will never be much better<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n20" id="r20">20</a></sup>—he too was a soldier, has for several months had throat disease—he is married &amp; has
      a family—I believe I have told you of still another brother in the army, down in the
      9th Army Corps, has been in the service over two years, he is very rugged &amp; healthy—has
      been in many battles, but only once wounded, at first Fredericksburgh.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Monday forenoon November 9.
      Dear comrades, as I did not finish my letter yesterday afternoon, as I had many friends
      come to see me, I will finish it now—the news this morning is that Meade is shoving
      Lee back upon Richmond, &amp; that we have already given the rebs some hard knocks, there
      on the old Rappahannock fighting ground. O I do hope the Army of the Potomac will
      at last gain a first-class victory, for they have had to retreat often enough, &amp; yet
      I believe a better Army never trod the earth than they are &amp; have been for over a
      year.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, dear comrades, it looks so different here in all this mighty city, every thing
      going with a big rush &amp; so gay, as if there was neither war nor hospitals in the land.
      New York &amp; Brooklyn appear nothing but prosperity &amp; plenty. Every where carts &amp; trucks
      &amp; carriages &amp; vehicles on the go, loaded with goods, express-wagons, omnibuses, cars,
      &amp;c—thousands of ships along the wharves, &amp; the piers piled high, where they are loading
      or unloading the cargoes—all the stores crammed with every thing you can think of,
      &amp; the markets with all sorts of provisions—tens &amp; hundreds of thousands of people
      every where, (the population is 1,500,000), almost every body well-drest, &amp; appearing to have enough—then the splendid river &amp; harbor here, full of ships,
      steamers, sloops, &amp;c—then the great street, Broadway, for four miles, one continual
      jam of people, &amp; the great magnificent stores all along on each side, &amp; the show windows
      filled with beautiful &amp; costly goods—I never saw the crowd thicker, nor such goings
      on &amp; such prosperity—&amp; as I passed through Baltimore &amp; Philadelphia it seemed to be
      just the same.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am quite fond of crossing on the Fulton ferry, or South ferry, between Brooklyn
      &amp; New York, on the big handsome boats. They run continually day &amp; night. I know most
      of the pilots, &amp; I go up on deck &amp; stay as long as I choose. The scene is very curious,
      &amp; full of variety. The shipping along the wharves looks like a forest of bare trees.
      Then there are all classes of sailing vessels &amp; steamers, some of the grandest &amp; most
      beautiful steamships in the world, going or coming from Europe, or on the California
      route, all these on the move. As I sit up there in the pilot house, I can see every
      thing, &amp; the distant scenery, &amp; away down toward the sea, &amp; Fort Lafayette &amp;c. The
      ferry boat has to pick its way through the crowd. Often they hit each other, then
      there is a time—
   </p>
   
   <p>My loving comrades, I am scribbling all this in my room in my mother's house. It is
      Monday forenoon—I have now been home about a week in the midst of relations, &amp; many
      friends, many young men, some I have known from childhood, many I love very much.
      I am out quite a good deal, as we are glad to be with each other—they have entertainments
      &amp;c. But truly, my dear comrades, I never sit down, not a single time, to the bountiful
      dinners &amp; suppers to which I am taken in this land of wealth &amp; plenty without feeling
      it would be such a comfort to all, if you too, my dear &amp; loving boys, could have each
      your share of the good things to eat &amp; drink, &amp; of the pleasure &amp; amusement. My friends
      among the young men make supper parties, after which there is drinking &amp;c., every
      thing prodigal &amp; first rate, one, Saturday night, &amp; another last night—it is much
      pleasure, yet often in the midst of the profusion, the palatable dishes to eat, &amp;
      the laughing &amp; talking, &amp; liquors &amp;c, my thoughts silently turn to Washington, to all who lie there sick &amp; wounded, with bread &amp; molasses for supper—
   </p>
   
   <p>Lewy, dear son, I think I shall remain here ten or twelve days longer, &amp; then I will
      try to be with you once again. If you feel like it I would like to have you write
      me soon, tell me about the boys, especially James Stilwell, Pleasant Borley, Cunningham,
      &amp; from the cavalry boy Edwin in ward B—tell me whether Elijah Fox in ward G has gone
      home—Lew, when you write to Tom Sawyer<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n21" id="r21">21</a></sup> you know what to say from me—he is one I love in my heart, &amp; always shall till death,
      &amp; afterwards too—I wish you to tell a young man in ward D, 2d bed below the middle
      door, (his first name is Isaac,<sup><a href="#loc.00802_n22" id="r22">22</a></sup> he is wounded in left leg, &amp; it has had erysipelas), that I sent him my love, &amp; I
      wish him to have this letter to read if he desires it, &amp; I will see him again before
      long.
   </p>
   
   <p>So, Lew, I have given you a lot of messages but you can take your time to do them,
      only I wish each of the boys I have mentioned to have my letter that wishes it, &amp;
      read it at leisure for themselves, &amp; then pass to another. If Miss Hill in ward F
      or the lady nurse in ward E cares about reading it to the boys in those wards for
      my sake, you give it them some evening, as I know the boys would like to hear from
      me, as I do from them.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, Lewy, I must bid you good bye for present, dear son, &amp; also to all the rest
      of my dear comrades, &amp; I pray God to bless you, my darling boys, &amp; I send you all
      my love, &amp; I hope it will be so ordered to let things go as easy as possible with
      all my dear boys wounded or sick, &amp; I hope it will be God's will that we shall all
      meet again, my dear loving comrades, not only here but hereafter.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Lewis Kirke Brown (1843–1926) was
      wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on August 19, 1862, and lay
      where he fell for four days. Eventually he was transferred to Armory Square
      Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in February 1863. In a diary in the
      Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on February 19, 1863, as "a most
      affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come and sit by him." Because the
      wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on January 5, 1864. Whitman was
      present and described the operation in a diary (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection
      of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out
      in August 1864, and was employed in the Provost General's office in September;
      see Whitman's 
      . The following
      September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief
      of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until his retirement
      in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was prepared by Brown's
      family and is now held in the Library of Congress.) Brown had written from
      Judiciary Square Hospital on , and

      letter to Traubel on November 15, 1888, he said: "You'll find two versions—that
      is, the vague notes, then the inked letter—the letter that went was passed
      around: they don't essentially differ, if at all: I got the sent letter back
      from Lew Brown" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [New York: Rowman and Littlefield, 1961], 3:100). On the
      following day he remarked to Traubel: "Did you read the huge hospital letter?
      Did it remind you of anything? My relations with the boys there in Washington
      had fatherly, motherly, brotherly intimations—touched life on many sides:

      I don't seem to be able to review that experience, that period, without extreme

   <p id="loc.00802_n11">11. Manville Wintersteen, of
      the Sixth Ohio Cavalry, was wounded in the left shoulder, and, according to the
      "Notebook: September–October, 1863" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection),
      "came in frozen" from a "cav[alry] fight." In his hospital notes, Whitman termed
      him "a noble sized young fellow" (Charles I. Glicksberg, <em>Walt
         Whitman and the Civil War</em> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania
      Press, 1933], 150), and referred to him briefly in <em>Specimen
         Days</em> (Richard Maurice Bucke, ed., <em>The Complete
         Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 4:134).
      In 1875 Whitman wrote to Wintersteen, who, on March 1, replied: "I can not place
      you as I did not learn your name but havent forgot the kindness I recived while
      in the Arm[or]y Square Hospital" (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New
      York Public Library). On March 10 of the same year, Wintersteen acknowledged
      receipt of Whitman's picture, and on August 5 described his not-so-prosperous
      circumstances. Whitman's letters to Wintersteen are evidently not

      disease," however, was consumption. Whitman recorded a "dying scene night of
      October 22": "—speaks of the doctor, the lady nurse so kind, so tender, 'the
