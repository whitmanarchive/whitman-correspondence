      <br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am gathering facts and data for a "History of the Whitman Family"</p>
   
   
   <p>Will you be so kind as to give me a history of your line as far back as you can trace
      them definitely.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Please state names and when and where your great-grandfather &amp; 
      gr.
      
       
      gd.mother
      
       were
      born married and died; when &amp; where your grandfather and grandmother were born
      
      m.
      
       &amp; 
      d.;
       when &amp; where their children, (your uncles and aunts) were 
      b.
      
       
      m.
      
       &amp;
      
      d.
      
       &amp; when &amp; where your father and mother were 
      b.

       &amp;

       and when &amp;
      where their children were 
      b.
      
       &amp; 
      m.
      
       or died or where now living giving in each
      case the maiden name of the wives and the names of their parents as far as
      possible.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Please give <u>all</u> <u>names</u> and <u>all</u> <u>dates</u> in full as far as
      possible.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Please give occupation, profession, the offices any have held in Church or State,
      their character and any incidents in the lives of the different members of the
      family, and any other interesting particulars you may know.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Also as far as you can give the address of each head of a family of all the <u>descendants</u> of your grandfather or
      greatgrandfather, who will be the best,
      to give further information.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I write to you as I know you are better fitted by many years of writing to undertake
      the task of giving an account of your ancestor and his descendants; and perhaps it
      may be well to send me a preliminary outline or chart of the family and their
      connection, with dates of birth, 
      mar.
      
       &amp; deaths.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Time is short and every one; who have not grown indifferent as to their earthly
      origin and who would honor their progenitors; should set about preserving the
      records of their families.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Wishing you health and prosperity and hoping to hear from you,</p>
