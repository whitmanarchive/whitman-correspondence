      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letters from Washington have all reached me, with the others enclosed. The last
      from you was dated Sept 27. You did not mention William in it—I should always like
      to hear about him &amp; from him. Is Nelly in Boston? If so say I sent my best love, not
      forgetting little Jennie. The last letter I received from Nelly was from Little Compton
      Aug 18—I have written subsequently &amp; directed there, which I suppose she received—I
      have not heard from her since—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am pretty well, perhaps not so unconsciously hearty as before my sickness—We are deprest in spirits home here about my brother George, (2d div 9th Corps)—if not killed, he
      is a prisoner—he was in the engagement of Sept 30 on the extreme left.31
   </p>
   
   <p>My book is not yet being printed. I still wish to stereotype it myself. I could easily
      still put it in the hands of a proper publisher then, &amp; make better terms with him.
   </p>
   
   <p>If you write to William I wish you to enclose him this letter—I wish him to receive
      again my faithful friendship—while breath &amp; sense remain I cannot forget what he has
      been to me—I love him dearly—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The weather here is fine of late—to-day a little blowy—The political meetings in New
      York &amp; Brooklyn are immense—I go to them as to shows, fireworks, cannon, clusters
      of gaslights, countless torches, banners &amp; mottos, 15, 20, 50,000 people—Per contra I occasionally go riding off in the country, in
      quiet lanes, or a sail on the water, &amp; many times to the sea shore at Coney Island—
   </p>
   
   <p>All the signs are that Grant is going to strike forthwith, perhaps risk all—One feels
      solemn who sees what depends. The military success, though first-class of war, is
      the least that depends—
   </p>
   
   <p>Good bye, dearest comrade, write me whenever you can—if I make any move I shall let
      you know—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>."
