      <br></br><br></br> Dearest Friend:
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p> At last I have extracted a little bit of news about you from friend Carpenter,<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r1">1</a></sup> who never comes to see us and is [as] reluctant to write
      letters as—somebody else that I know. That you have a comfortable, elderly
      couple to keep house for you was a good hearing—for "the old shanty" had risen
      before my eyes as somewhat lonely, &amp; perhaps the cooking, &amp;c., not well
      attended to.—There seems a curious kind of ebb and flow about the recognition
      of you in England—just now there are signs of the flow—of a steadily
      gathering great wave, one indication of which is the little pamphlet just published
      in Edinburgh—one of the "Round Table" Series<sup><a href="#loc.05770_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—no doubt a copy has been
      sent you. If not and you would care to see it, I will send you one. On the whole I
      like it (barring one or two stupidities)—at any rate, as compared with what
      has hitherto been written. My poor article has so far been rejected by
      editors—so I have laid it by for a little, to come with a fresh eye &amp; see
      if I can make it in any way more likely to win a hearing—though I often say to
      myself, "If they have not ears to hear you, how is it likely one can unstop their
      ears?" But on the other hand there is always the chance of leading some to read the
      Poems who had not else done so.—Percy &amp; Norah and Archie,<sup><a href="#n0263" id="r3">3</a></sup> now grown a very sturdy active little fellow, are coming to
      spend Xmas with us, which is a great pleasure. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I am deep in Froude's last volumes of "Carlyle's Life in London".<sup><a href="#loc.05770_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> Folks are grumbling that they have had enough &amp; too
      much of Carlyle &amp; <em>his</em> grumblings and sarcasms. But he is an inexhaustibly
      interesting figure to me, &amp; will remain so in the long run to the world, I am
      persuaded. It grieves me that he should have been so cruelly unjust to himself as
      a
      husband—that remorse, those bitter self-reproaches, were undeserved, were
      altogether morbid: he was not only an infinitely better husband than she was wife:
      he was wonderfully affectionate &amp; tender &amp; just—&amp; as to his temper
      &amp; irritable nerves, she knew what she was about when she married him. Herby was
      walking through the British Museum the other day with a friend when a group, a
      ready-made picture, struck him—it was a young student-sculptress, a graceful
      girl high on a pile of boxes modelling in clay a copy of an antique statue, &amp;
      standing below, looking up at her, was a young sculptor in his blouse, criticising
      her work with much animation &amp; gesture; the background of the group, a part of
      the Elgin Marbles. So this is what Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r5">5</a></sup> is painting &amp; I
      think he will make a very jolly little picture out of it. I have been much a
      prisoner to the house with bad colds ever since I returned from Wolverhampton, but
      am beginning to get out again—which puts new life into me. I have never envied
      anything in this world but a man's strong legs &amp; powers of tramping, tramping,
      over hill &amp; dale as long as he pleases—legs would content me and a sound
      breathing apparatus! I am in no hurry for wings. Giddy's voice, too, is just now
      eclipsed by cold. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I hope you have escaped this evil and are able to jaunt to &amp; fro on the ferries as
      freely as
      ever. And I hope the pleasant Quaker friends are well—and Mr. &amp; Mrs.
      Whitman<sup><a href="#n1046" id="r6">6</a></sup> and Hattie<sup><a href="#n0911" id="r7">7</a></sup> &amp; Jessie<sup><a href="#n1055" id="r8">8</a></sup>—there is a fellow student of Giddy's<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      at the Guild Hall music school who so reminds her of Hattie.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0141b">1. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="n0263">3. Percy Carlyle Gilchrist (1851–1935) was the
      son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, the only of their four children who did not
      accompany their mother to Philadelphia in 1876 when she met Whitman, as Percy
      Gilchrist was newly married to Norah Fitzmaurice at the time. At about the same
      time (1875–1877), Percy Gilchrist collaborated with his cousin Sidney
      Gilchrist Thomas on refining the Bessemer process for the mass production of
      steel.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.05770_n1">4. James Anthony Froude
      (1818–1894) was a British historian and novelist. His writings on Carlyle
      were quite controversial and heated debate arose over Froude's inclusion of
      personal details in his biography of his late friend (Carlyle died in
      1881).<a href="#r4">[back]
