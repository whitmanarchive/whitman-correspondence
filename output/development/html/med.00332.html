   <p>Know Walt Whitman that I am a woman! I am not beautiful, but I love you! I am thirty-two
      years old. I am one of the workers of the world. A friend carelessly lends me Leaves
      of Grass for a day. Stealing an hour from labor I take it out for a walk. I do not
      know what I carry in my arms pressed close to my side and bosom! I feel a strange
      new sympathy! a mysterious delicious thrill! what means it? It is the loving contact
      of an affinite soul blending harmoniously with mine. I begin to know Walt Whitman. I have not yet
      seen him. I feel that I must be alone. I turn my steps to "Zion's Mill" a cemetery.
      The sun shines, the air is clean and fine, the birds trill songs, love songs, songs
      of praise for the boon of existence, or chirrup amorously to each other. They do not
      hesitate to tell their love: why should I? I seat myself under a tree and muse a moment.
      A lovely panorama is before me. Hartford and the surrounding country. I hear no human
      voice, see no human form. The ashes of the dead are spread around me. "Did I say the
      dead?" I am alone. "Am I alone?" I could sit thus forever with my newly-found soul.
      But <em>somebody</em> whispers, open your book! What care I for books now (though loved companions ever
      before). I have that which is better than books. The book opens itself. What do I
      behold! oh! blessed eyes! I see the image of the great beloved soul, which has already
      embraced encompassed me. Blessed be thy father and thy mother and the hour of thy
      conception. Oh! rich is America in her noble, manly, fearless son.
   </p>  
   
   <p>Know Walt Whitman that thou hast a child for me! A noble beautiful perfect manchild.
      I charge you my love not to give it to another woman. The world demands it! It is
      not for you and me, <em>is our child</em>, but for the world. My womb is clean and pure. It is ready for thy child my love.
      Angels guard the vestibule until thou comest to deposit our and the world's precious
      treasure. Then oh! how tenderly, oh! how lovingly will I cherish and guard it, our
      child my love. Thine the pleasure my love. Mine the sweet burden and pain. Mine the
      sacrifice. Mine to have the stinging rebuke, the shame. I am willing. My motives are
      pure and holy. Our boy my love! Do you not already love him? He must be begotten on
      a mountain top, in the open air. Not in <em>lust</em>, not in mere gratification of sensual passion, but in holy ennobling pure strong
      deep glorious passionate broad universal love. I charge you to prepare my love.
   </p>
   
   <p>I love you, I love you, come, come. Write.</p>
