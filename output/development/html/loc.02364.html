      <br></br><br></br>My dear Friend Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I write you from the Reading Room of the British Museum. </p>
   
   <p>I am here looking into some early history and being a little tired I wished to have
      something to refresh me so that I called for "Leaves of Grass" published in 1855 in
      Brooklyn New York— a rare picturesque old book 4°. I have just laid it down and taken
      up my pen to tell you of the fresh and vigorous fruit  your rattling sentences have
      filled me with. If compliments are not disagreeable to you when sincere or whether
      they are or not I now take the liberty of telling you that there is more of the
      essence of life and movement in your Leaves of Grass than anything I have ever met
      with and that it is one of those few books whose vacancy could not be  readily supplied
      by another. A man or woman with any life could not help but be electrified by your
      immense sweeps in those inspiring sentences. Being away from home I think I feel
      more keenly the spirit of your verses. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope that this will find you well and I also hope that I may receive a line from
      you  telling me
      of your well being. 
   </p>
   
   <p>My address is No 48 Rue d'Orsel Paris.</p>

      Very affectionately yours
      <br></br>Percy Ives.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Percy Ives, grandson of
      Elisa Leggett, was an aspiring artist who made several pencil sketches of
      Whitman on December 21, 1881. They resulted in the oil painting now in the
      Feinberg Collection (Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On , Whitman wrote to Percy in answer
      to a letter now lost. See Charles E. Feinberg, "Percy Ives, Detroit and Walt
      Whitman," <em>Detroit Historical Society Bulletin</em> 16
      (February 1960), 5–8.
