      <br></br><br></br>Dear Charley,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am getting along favorably—looking on the sunny side of the case, I am
      probably better now than at any time since I was paralyzed—(though bad enough
      yet.) My improvement is not much in the head troubles, &amp; hardly any in my left
      leg, but very perceptible in my strength &amp; vim
      generally—&amp;
      my confidence remains (still unaffected in the main, by all the tediousness of hope
      deferred again &amp; again) that, for all I am in the woods yet, <em>I
         shall emerge</em> &amp; see light again. It was <em>to
         Harpers</em> I sold at handsome prices my pieces—(I sent a second one
      which, like the first, they took, at my own price at once &amp; sent me the
      money)—They are in type, and I have read the proofs. So they are off my mind.
      One is called "Song of the Redwood tree," (California) &amp; one the "Prayer of
      Columbus"—When they will appear I don't know, but suppose soon—take
      this to Nelly. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nelly, my dear, I received your welcome letter last evening. I am waiting for the
      photos of my St. Louis Nieces to be returned from an old grand-aunt of mine (92
      years old),<sup><a href="#med.00426_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> mother's mother's sister, who wanted to see them in N.Y., &amp; then I will
      send them to you. I spent Christmas alone here, as my brother and sister had gone
      down for three days on a visit to Delaware—I am in good heart. We shall yet
      meet, Nelly dear. 
   </p>

   <p>I send a P.O. Order for $30. for Godey—I sent him $20 on the 23rd.
