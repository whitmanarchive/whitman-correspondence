   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel (1856–1914), was
      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on his relationship with Whitman, see
      Thomas Biggs Harned, <em>Memoirs of Thomas B. Harned, Walt
         Whitman's Friend and Literary Executor</em>, ed. Peter Van Egmond (Hartford:
      Transcendental Books, 1972).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03180_n1">1. The address on this letter
      was crossed out with a diagonal line. Above it Whitman wrote: "send to T B
      Harned." The letter was originally addressed by Sidney H. Morse: Walt Whitman |
      328 Mickle st. | Camden - | New Jersey -. It is postmarked: Richmond [illegible] | Feb 23 | 6 [illegible] AM | [illegible]88; Camden, N.J. | Feb | 24 | 7 AM | 88 |
      Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n4265">2. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a
      traveling Quaker preacher and anti-slavery activist from Long Island, New York.
      For more on Hicks, see Henry Watson Wilbur, <em>The Life and
         Labors of Elias Hicks</em> (Philadelphia: Friends' General Conference
      Advancement Committee, 1910).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00863_n3">3. Sidney H. Morse was a
      self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to 1872,
      editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden many
      times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier bust by
      Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan, <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art, 1850–1920</em>
      (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2006), 57–84; and
