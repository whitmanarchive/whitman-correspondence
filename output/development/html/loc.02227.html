      Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When my friend, Mr. Linton was here last, I asked him, during one of our conversations
      about you, whether I might venture to send you the book I was then writing, as soon
      as it came out. If he had not encouraged me to do so, I should hardly have liked to
      trouble you with it, and yet there is no one living by whom I am more desirous to
      be known than by you. The "Leaves of
      
      
      of
      
       Grass" have become a part of my every-day thought and experience. I have considered
      myself as "the new person drawn toward" you; I have taken your warning, I have weighed
      all the doubts and the dangers, and the result is that I draw only closer and closer
      to you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I write this I consider how little it can matter to you in America, how you are regarded by a young man in England of whom you have never heard. And yet I cannot believe that you, the poet of comrades,
      will refuse
      
      the sympathy I lay at your feet. In any case I can but thank you for all that I have
      learned from you, all the beauty you have taught me to see in the common life of healthy
      men and women, and all the pleasure there is in the mere humanity of other people.
      The sense of all this was in me, but it was you, and you alone, who really gave it
      power to express itself. Often when I have been alone in the company of one or other
      of my dearest friends, in the very deliciousness of the sense of
      
      nearness and sympathy, it has seemed to me that you were somewhere invisibly with
      us.
   </p>
