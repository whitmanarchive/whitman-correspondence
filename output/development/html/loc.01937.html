      <br></br><br></br>Mr. Walt Whitman,
      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I do not forget what I am owing to you, and try in every way to raise <u>something</u> towards discharging my obligation to you. But I
      have been losing, instead of gaining, for some time. I know that sometime I shall
      have a good business, but that don't help matters for the present. In order to tide
      over the dullness, I have accepted proofreading outside of my business, altho'
      forbidden to do so by [
      <span class="unclear">realists?</span>]
      . Without being asked, you may be certain I shall send if but
      a small amount <u>as soon as I can</u>. You would be surprised if
      you knew  exactly what
      I have had to contend with in the way of obstacles for some time. I am occupied at
      proofreading from 7:30 A.M. till 5:30 P.M., with only a ½ hr. for lunch at
      noon. My business is in the hands of a [
      <span class="unclear">first?</span>]
       boy, &amp; I attend to my correspondence from 4 A.M.
      till 6:30 A.M. &amp; from 7:30 to 10 P.M. &amp; sometimes later, and Sundays. I can
      still do nothing but ask for your indulgence. But my mortification at having to ask
      you to wait, under all the circumstances, is very great. Sometime I hope to make
      amends and a personal explanation.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      In great haste,
      <br></br>Yours truly,
      <br></br>
      C.P.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles P. Somerby was one of the book dealers whom
      Walt Whitman termed "embezzlers." In 1875 Somerby assumed the liabilities of
      Butts &amp; Co.; see Whitman's ,
      letter to Asa K. Butts &amp; Company. This proved to be a matter of
      embarrassment to Somerby, who, in reply to a lost letter on March 16, 1875, was
      unable "to remit the amount you name at present." On , he wrote: "It is very mortifying to me not to be in a
      position to send you even a small portion of the balance your due." On , Somerby sent $10—his only cash
      payment: "Have made every exertion to raise the $200 you require, and find it
      utterly impossible to get it. . . . We had hoped that you would accept our offer
      to get out your new book, and thus more than discharge our indebtedness to you."
      On , Somerby reported that "I have
      been losing, instead of gaining." On ,
      he sent Walt Whitman a statement pertaining to the volumes mentioned in this
      letter. On , he included a complete
      financial statement: in eighteen months he had made only one cash payment, and
      owed Walt Whitman $215.17. The firm was still unable to make a payment on . In August 1877, Walt Whitman
      received a notice of bankruptcy dated August 8, 1877,
       from, in his
      own words, "assignee [Josiah Fletcher, an attorney] of the rascal Chas P.
      Somerby." These manuscripts are in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.
