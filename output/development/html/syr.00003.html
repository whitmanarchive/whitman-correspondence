      <br></br><br></br>My <em xmlns="">Dear</em> Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You do not know me—have never heard of me even—yet you have done more for
      me than all others.
   </p>
   
   <p>Born and bred in the midst of Puritanical orthodoxy I was early <em>entombed</em> in the church and never had a breath of the pure, free air of
      heaven till I was thirty-five years old. Swedenborg first
      opened the sepulchre and let in the heavenly light so that I saw myself a living
      soul, but it remained for you to breathe upon the <em>dry bones</em>
      and make <em>them</em> live. To you alone I owe the discovery that
      "Divine am I inside and out"—that the "body
      is not less sacred than the
      soul."
   </p>
   
   <p>Hours of depression come even upon you. This I know. Therefore, perhaps, it may cheer
      you in some such hour to know how you have lifted up and made happy a brother. This
      is my apology for this intrusion.
   </p>
   
   <p>I would I could grasp your hand, look in your eyes and have you look in mine. Then
      you should see how much you have done for me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">Yours with a brother's love

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>This is apparently Dr. William A. Hawley's first
      letter to Whitman. An October 24, 1888 letter from Whitman, with which Whitman
      sent Hawley one of his books, is not extant; neither is a letter that Whitman
      sent on February 6, 1890, according to his notebooks.
