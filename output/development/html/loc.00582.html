   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thayer and Eldridge was
      the Boston publishing firm responsible for the third edition of Walt Whitman's
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00582_n2">1. By the first week of 1861,
      Thayer and Eldridge publicly declared bankruptcy. As William Wilde Thayer later
      remembered in his unpublished autobiography, his publishing firm was "caught
      with all sails spread, without warning of the storm. Merchants at once began to
      retrench and reduce liabilities. Capital hid itself. Banks were distrustful. No
      one knew how the war would end. Books being a luxury, there was no demand. All
      book firms were 'shaky.' . . . Anti-slavery people were interested in keeping
      [Thayer and Eldridge] up, but they were forced to call in their funds and most
      reluctantly let us go down"" (see William Wilde Thayer, "Autobiography of
      William Wilde Thayer," 22, unpublished manuscript, Feinberg Collection).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00582_n3">2. Whitman was asked to return
      the advance check he received (and was previously asked not to cash) for his
      proposed volume of poetry <em>The Banner At Day-Break</em>. Mr.
      Honeybun worked as Thayer and Eldridge's book-keeper.<a href="#r2">[back]
