      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am going to <em>try</em> and write you a few lines this morning, but you must overlook my poor composition
      also my writing, for I am very weak and my mind is not as it was before I was <em>sun stroke</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00145_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup>. Walt, this is the first letter I have writen since I came home, but it is by no means the first one I would like to have writen you. Walt (you must excuse one for so adressing you) your letters have been of more value to me than you can imagine, it was not
      only the words that was writen that don me the good but to know that they come from the bottom of the heart of a
      true and sympathizing friend.—It does not seem as though I could ever repay you for
      your kindness toward me both while I was in the Hospital, and since I came home. I
      often think to myself, what can I do to repay you for your kindness I can think of
      nothing at present, but sometime I may have an opportunity. your letters are not only
      a blessing to me but a comfort to my friend to know that I have the sympathy, and
      good will, of a true friend, like yourself. My Sister and also my friends are very
      anxious to see and to read your <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and I hope they soon may soon have an oportunity of so doing. I do not wish you to think that I want to beg one of you, but that I
      wish to buy one of them.
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt, In your letters you wish me to imagine you talking with me when I read them,
      well I do, and it does very well to think about, but it is nothing compared with the
      original.
   </p>
   
   <p>I presume you would like to know how I have been since I came home and how I am at
      the present time. I have been <em>pretty sick</em>. My furlough of forty days is out to day (for to day is Sunday so you will see that
      it has taken me some time to write this simple epistle). and in days of which time
      I knew nothing and no friends and also the Doctor gave me up! Dear Walt, it has been
      Gods blessed will for me to regain my health in a small degree and to day I am able
      to be proped up in bed and able to write to my true friend and comrade. I am just about the same
      as I was when <em>you</em> saw me at Armory Hospital. I have to be sure begun with kind friend who have been
      friends sure but then Walt I would have amused them all for a few days if you could
      have been with me. how often think I of the many fine chats we have had all alone
      by ourselves in a loving and peaceful manner and those days will never be forgoten by me, and I am certain they will not by you, In your last you spoke about my furlough,
      in regard to that my Doctor has got through the proses you spoke of, and I am as anxious
      to be honorable in regard to that matter, as you are to have me and I hope there may
      be no trouble. My Sister Mary says when I go back to war she shall write to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>This is what I call a short and simple letter but it is writen by me. I will bid you good by hoping to hear from you soon. I am yours with love
      and respect
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00145_n100">1. As Whitman informed Mrs.
      Curtis in a , Caleb Babbitt
      suffered a sun stroke in July and was admitted to Armory Square Hospital.
      According to the "Hospital Note Book" (Henry E. Huntington Library), Babbitt had
      been in Mobile, Alabama, earlier. About August 1, 1863, he left Washington on
      furlough. On , Caleb's sister, Mary
      A. Babbitt informed Whitman of Caleb's arrival in Barre, Massachusetts; because
      of his exhaustion he was unable to write. On , at the expiration of his forty-day furlough, Caleb was
      strong enough to write: "Walt—In your letters you wish me to imagine you talking
      with me when I read them, well I do, and it does very well to think about, but
      it is nothing compared with the original." On , Babbitt was depressed—"dark clouds seem to be lying in my
      pathway and I can not remove them nor hide them from my mind"—until he mentioned
      his beloved, Nellie F. Clark, who "has saved me." On , S. H. Childs wrote for Caleb from the Massachusetts
      General Hospital, Boston: "He Is unable to set up &amp; suffers considerable
      pain In his
      head."
