      My dear Walt Whitman,
      
      
   </p>  
   
   <p>
      Another perfect day. I write this in Dr's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> office @ 4.30pm.—The windows—wide open—admit 
      a gentle pleasant breeze. Outside, the sky perfectly clear &amp; cloudless, the fountain
      playing, 
      the trees across the open space, along the avenue &amp; in the distance with shades &amp;
      various colours&amp;very 
      beautiful in the sunshine. Dr Beemer just entering his buggy as I write, &amp; driving
      off. 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      It seems to me as though I had entered an "Earthly Paradise."—Day after day of unsurpassed
      beauty—nights 
      of wonderful moonlight radiance, doubly beautiful amid the trees &amp; on the lawns &amp;
      flowers of this beautiful 
      place—the soothing rest &amp; peace &amp; the hospitable kindness of all the people here—all
      combine to 
      make it very sweet &amp; pleasant to me. Indeed, I tell the Dr. that unless I leave soon
      I shall find it difficult 
      to tear myself away! 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I have no special news since my last letter. We drove
      
      into town yesterday afternoon—everything of interest to me, the shops, the vehicles,
      the people, the streets, buildings 
      pavements, fields, <u>everything</u>—and everything looking its best in the glorious 
      sunshine.—Evening spent in the house—chiefly in learning &amp; playing "Pedro" with Willie
      &amp; his friends.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      To chapel this morning, &amp; afterwards to church! (Rev'd Mr Richardson's.) Thoughts
      &amp; feelings 
      of a very mixed character! 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Dr. writing letters &amp;c. He seems to me to look a good
      
      deal better since he came home,—has a better colour &amp; looks fresher.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      ———
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      A long pause here—discussing future arrangements as to my trip with Dr. Decided nothing,
      however, for the present.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I hope that we shall hear that you have been able to take a drive again this lovely
      weather.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Dr. says he is "going to quit whether school keeps or not." So <u>I</u> will quit too. With love to you 
      always &amp; best wishes
      
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.04389_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328, Mickle St | Camden | New Jersey. | <u>US.</u>. It is postmarked: London | AM | SP 21 | 91 | CANADA; Camden N.J.

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
