   <p>Your good letter rec'd this morning. Come &amp; see me whenever you can. It is very easyâ€”6
      or 8 
      trains fro &amp; to N. Y. every day &amp; night. Come either by boat to Amboy, &amp; so directly
      here to 
      Camden depot, (only 60 rods from this house,) or from Jersey City to West Philadelphia
      depot, 
      &amp; so down Market st. by horse cars to Camden ferry at foot of it. I am about the same.
      
      Jeff is here with me (from St. Louis) for a couple of days.
