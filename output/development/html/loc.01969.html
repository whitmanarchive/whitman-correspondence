   <p>I enclose you one of the very many letters I write to you—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I think I have written to you at least once a week for the
      past four years—sometimes I write long letters, sometimes short one's. But so
      you know my dear friend they are all real to me—and I often keep them months
      before I destroy them.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Many and many a mile have I rode on a Locomotive while in charge of a Freight-train
      and had you by my side in conversation—which to me was as really a <u>presence</u> as in years gone by on the box of a Broadway
      stage—or a 
      Sleep and lounge on the deck of a Fulton Ferry Boat—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Walt in all your Sorrow that has been made public, I have sorrowed with
      you—Most especially in the death of Dear Mother, and your own illness
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If you can Dear Walt write to me and acknowledge the receipt of this—If you
      cannot, I shall still keep writing, in my own way
   </p>
