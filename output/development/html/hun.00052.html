      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The little essay in The "Galaxy" is hardly deserving the
      attention you give it; yet its author is not insensible to the opinion of so
      accomplished a critic as yourself. Let me thank you for your expressions of interest
      and appreciation.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I certainly had no design to disparage genius &amp; culture much less to attack them
      but only to call up and emphasise other points—as it were put in a plea for
      the ground work, when nearly everybody is [
      <span class="unclear">soliciting?</span>]
       only about the pattern. The older I grow the more
      disposed I am to subordinate the author to the man, and the less satisfaction I have
      in mere literacy or scholastic  attainments. I see that literature is served, perhaps alone
      deeply and finally served, by other things than literary culture. [
      <span class="unclear">Tried?</span>]
       by purely artistic
      standards, we should be obliged to pronounce half a dozen current poets great. The
      reason they are not great is because they are deficient as men. They have the knack,
      they have all that culture can do, and yet there is not one 
      <u>life giving</u> word in them. It was this idea which I tried
      to make the point of the essay. I cannot but feel that at least the tone and spirit
      of current criticism is "antagonistic" to this suggestion. As an opinion or an
      abstract statement, no doubt most persons would asscent to it; but let it be carried
      out in literature, let a poet or artist appear, who shall not aim to express mere
      book culture, or any of the  artificial phases of our civilization—its exclusions from
      the air, the sun, the Earth, but to open up the abysses of 
      primative
      
       power and feeling, and quicken and fertilize the spirit as nature does,
      and what would the critics say, even the best of them? I demand therefore that
      literature shall express more than literature, more than what is usually meant by
      genius or refinement, or intellect, be it the best in the world. Indeed when  I think of a supreme
      work or poem, I have in my mind one in which all these things are lost, and the
      total impression of which is the spirit of manly action and performance. The
      greatest poem savors of nothing indoors, nothing conventional, no premeditated
      polish, no craft, or model, not even art, but of the spirit of universal nature. It
      is something like this that draws me to the Greek poets. If I could read them in the
      original no doubt I 
      should be much more sensible of it. What impresses me particularly in Aeschylus is his stern moral grandeur. His polish if he has
      such never obtrudes itself upon my attention.
   </p>
   
   <p>It seems to me almost useless to attempt anything in the usual complacent Addisonian
      style at this time and in this country, at least write a view to promote <u>American</u> literature thereby. I see no possible chance for
      a national literature here, until we  have something deep cut and original, some tremendous
      overwhelming genius and man, whose plowshare shall completely obliterate all this
      pretty ornamental scratching of garden tools at the surface and open up the soil for
      new and hardy crops. He must be coarse and broad as well as subtle and absorptive,
      and above all things audacious. Violence must be done. These deft and dainty
      gentlemen who think such a  punch luck as "Katharena" a great poem
      must be shocked, and larger and more robust standards must be introduced.
   </p>
   
   <p>I find it easy, as you see, to predict the man we need when I believe in the living
      example before me. My prophecy follows the fact. My admiration for Walt Whitman has
      been of too gradual a growth and the source of too much moral and spiritual help to
      me for me ever to suspect that I have either over estimated,  or misestimated him. I find him, on long
      and intimate acquaintance, even more suggestive and significant, as a man than as
      an
      author. Indeed he is, in his personal make and presence, the curious counterpart of
      his Book, and I doubt if I could ever have come to a complete understanding of the
      one without the other. Among other things his glory is that in an age when almost
      every book and poem is of a pathological character—the result of  some mental or
      spiritual disease, or of some one faculty pushed beyond its legitimate sphere of
      development, he has produced a vast work which is perfectly consistent with the
      health and <u>wholeness</u> of the individual. <u>Leaves of Grass</u> is the rare "phenomenon" of a work of the
      imagination and the intellect which is an actual stay to human longevity and
      strength. It is not a thought but an act, as creation is, and this is my definition
      of a supreme work of art. All the great poems are like  deeds, and imply the same totality of
      the human being. In this way they are moral without having any direct moral aim; and
      poetical and intellectual in the same manner. I have written a little book about the
      poet which I shall take the liberty to send you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I yield to more in my admiration for Hawthorne
      as a writer, as a manipulator of words. Yet I cannot say that he has ever been of
      much help to me, as Emerson has and as Whitman still [illegible]
       has. Hawthorne is
      exceptional; he does not stand in the regular order of things; he is not great on
      the common grounds, and I cannot think that such as he betoken the general soundness
      and well-being of the race, as Whitman does. I think even Thoreau is a more
      auspicious sign.
   </p>
   
   <p>You see I am determined to hold part to the manhood test. There are enough to exalt
      polish, and art, and scholarship, so far as my voice goes it shall be raised only
      for that which goes forward with  human life and strength.
   </p>

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
