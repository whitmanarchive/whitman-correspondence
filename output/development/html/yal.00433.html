       of the <u>whole issue</u> of "Leaves of Grass," including the former ones with
      the new ones, for they are all of a uniform pattern.—This would afford a
      splendid living American 
      Vol.
      
       that would go like the devil through the West, and among the young men

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00433_n1">1. This fragment appears to be
      a draft letter, evidenced both by the informal signature and the fact that it
      appears on the reverse of a draft of Whitman's poem, "Others May Praise What
      They Like," which was first published in <em>Drum Taps</em> in
      1865. Ted Genoways has argued that the letter draft probably dates to late 1879
      or early 1880, based on the poetry draft (which he thinks was likely an
      intermediary stage between the poem's publication in <em>Drum-Taps</em> and its revised appearance in the 1881 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>) and Whitman's visit to the West that
      fell in the summer and fall of 1879 (<em>The Correspondence</em>
      [Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2004], 57). We have dated the letter
      earlier, however, thinking it was probably meant for Thayer and Eldridge, since
      Whitman was eager to have them press for sales of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> in the west. In his anonymous self-review, "All About a
      Mocking-Bird," Whitman discussed the forthcoming third edition of 1860: "The
      market needs to-day to be supplied—the great West especially—with
      copious thousands of copies" (<em>New York Saturday Press</em> [7
      January 1860], 3).<a href="#r1">[back]
