   <p id="meh.00001_n1">1. This note was written in
      reply to Osgood's letter of May 23, in which he asked for "the copy <em>this</em> week, as I sail for Europe in a fortnight" (The
      Library of Congress; <em>The Complete Writings of Walt
         Whitman</em> [New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 7:278).<a href="#r1">[back]
