   <p>Fine, still sunny day, not cold—continue ab't the same—pretty comfortable
      upon the whole—N Y Herald 23d last Sunday has a leading (book notice) two
      third column review of Nov: Boughs,<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r2">2</a></sup> mostly extracts—favorable more than any
      thing else<sup><a href="#loc.07537_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—glad you hit (fix)<sup><a href="#loc.07537_n6" id="r4">4</a></sup> on the
      autobiographic underlying element of the collected Vol<sup><a href="#loc.07537_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Was wondering whether <em>that</em> w'd be detected—did
      not say anything ab't it, but it has been in my mind of late y'rs
      unremittedly—of course not in the usual auto-writing style &amp; even
      purposes, but with a freer margin—&amp; I think if the book really grips, <em>that</em> will be what the good class literary detectives of the
      future will mainly settle &amp; agree upon—Then I sh'd be tickled enough if I
      c'd think I had indeed skimm'd some of the <em>real cream</em> of the
      American History of the last 35 years &amp; preserv'd it here—I have sent to
      some 20 of our friends &amp; specialists home &amp; abroad (wrapt in the <em>Post</em> item of last Thursday) the printed copy of y'r letter
      ab't it—(the "impromptu criticism")—I send you Kennedy's<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r6">6</a></sup> letter of 25th<sup><a href="#loc.07537_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup>—yr's of 26th

   <p>Yes, I shall <em>mind</em>—think I understand &amp; accept the
      matter below it, &amp; shall practically put it in action—as I finish I am

      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n3999">2. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.07537_n2">3. The title of the review
      was "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/boughs/anc.00119.html">Walt Whitman Unbosoms Himself About Poetry</a>." Whitman considered the
      notice "very good: a very generous one" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.58.html">Friday, December 28, 1888</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07537_n6">4. Bucke had written to Whitman
      on December 20, 1888, registering at length his enthusiasm for Whitman's
      just-published <em>Complete Poems and Prose</em>. Whitman decided
      to have Bucke's letter printed for distribution among his friends and disciples,
      and he titled it "An impromptu criticism on the 900 page Volume, 'The Complete
      Poems and Prose of Walt Whitman,' first issued December, 1888." The first
      printing had several typos, including the addition of an acute accent over the
      first "e" of "Goethe," so Whitman had the errors corrected in a second printing
      that was completed by January 2, 1889. See Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.57.html">Thursday, December 27, 1888</a>.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07537_n3">5. In "An impromptu
      criticism," Bucke wrote: "It is a gigantic massive autobiography, the first of
      its kind. . . ." For Whitman's guarded reaction to Bucke's assertion, see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.51.html">Friday, December 21, 1888</a>.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">6. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="loc.07537_n5">8. Since Bucke's letter of
      December 26 is missing, it is not possible to explain Whitman's allusion in the
      following paragraph. For speculation as to what Whitman may have been referring
      to, see Bucke's letter to Whitman of , note 2.<a href="#r8">[back]
