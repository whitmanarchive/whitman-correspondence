   <p>Thank you &amp; double-thank you, my dear young man, for your affectionate letter
      &amp; money help $25 which came safely to-day—Every thing is going on here
      much the same—Mrs. D[avis]<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r1">1</a></sup> is well &amp; busy—&amp; I sit
      here each day in the big chair by the window—(slowly waning I suppose)—H
      Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> is back in London with his picture, wh' as I
      understand gets good opinions. I have heard from him once or twice. I am expecting
      Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> here soon. Morse<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r4">4</a></sup> the
      sculptor is still here. Mr Eakins the portrait painter, of Phila<sup><a href="#n3166" id="r5">5</a></sup>:, is going to have
      a whack at me next week.<sup><a href="#loc.07361_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Dull dark dripping day as I write. My little canary is singing blithely. I enclose
      you my last pieces—Yes, indeed we shall be glad to see you—Mrs D will
      &amp; I will—Meanwhile love to you &amp; God bless you—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Leonard M. Brown, a young
      English schoolteacher and friend of Herbert Gilchrist, came to America in May,
      1887. On  Gilchrist wrote to
      Whitman: "he is an uncommonly good fellow, quiet earnet serious soul and very
      practical, full of solid worth, whose knowledge and attainments are sure to be
      valued in America. His father is a clergyman, and this son of his reads Leaves
      of Grass silently &amp; unobserved by the sect of his orthodox family." An entry
      in Whitman's Commonplace Book on August 29 reads: "Leonard Morgan Brown goes
      back to Croton-on-Hudson—has been here ab't a week" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). See also Whitman's letter to Leonard Brown of ; his letter to Herbert Gilchrist
      of , note 2; and his letter to

      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's

   <p id="n0862">4. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,

   <p id="n3166">5. Thomas Eakins (1844–1919) was

      Whitman wrote in his Commonplace Book: "Thos. Eakins is here painting my
      portrait—it seems strong (I don't know but powerful) &amp;
      realistic—very different from Herbert's—It is pretty well advanced
      &amp; I think I like it—but we will see" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
