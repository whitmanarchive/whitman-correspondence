      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It gave me much pleasure to hear from you; and now I am
      quite full of gratitude for the photograph—a grand one—the present of
      all others desirable by me.  The copy suitable for an
      edition here should we be able to reach to that I have and shall keep carefully.
      When it is achieved it will probably be the result and fruit of more reviewing and
      discussion. I shall keep my eyes wide open; and the volume with O'C's introduction
      shall come out just as it is. I am not sure but that it will in the end have to be
      done at our own expense,—which I believe would be repaid.
      It
      is the kind of book that if it can once get out here will sell. The English groan
      for something better than the perpetual <u>réchauffé</u>
      
      of their literature. I have not been in London for some little time and have not yet
      had time to consult others about the matter. I shall be able to write you more
      satisfactorily a little later. I hear that you have written something in the <u>Galaxy</u>. Pray tell O'Connor I shall look to him to send me
      such things: I can't take <u>all</u> American magazines; but if
      you intend to write for the Galaxy regularly I shall take
      that.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With much friendship for you and O'Connor and his wife,
      <br></br>I am yours,
      <br></br>M.D. Conway
