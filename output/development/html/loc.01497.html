      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr
      Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yesterday your post-card &amp; your very welcome books reached me. I spent a good
      part of the day over Two Rivulets, the Preface, &amp; the Memoranda of the War,
      &amp; was not far from you, I think, in feeling, however separated in place. I seem
      to see some gains from the illness which has grieved us. Tones &amp; tints have
      passed from it into your writings which add to their comprehensiveness &amp; their
      truth &amp; tenderness. At the same time I hold to <u>
         L. of G.
         
         </u> &amp; accept it,—taking it as a whole—with entire
      satisfaction. It seems to me more for the soul, &amp;  for things beyond physiology than you,
      contrasting it with your projected songs more specially for the soul, quite
      recognize. The non-moral parts of it, such parts as simply are the "tally" of nature
      are taken up into other portions of <u>
         L. of G.
         
         </u> &amp; are spiritualized &amp; each part belongs to the other. In
      <u>
         L. of G.
         
         </u> I find a complete man, not body alone, or 
      cheefly
      
      , but body &amp; soul. That its <u>direct</u> tendency
      (&amp; not alone its indirect) is to invigorate &amp; reinforce the soul I feel
      assured. But in contrast to the pride &amp; buoyancy, &amp; resonant tones of <u>
         L. of G.
         
         </u> the tenderer, more penetrating, more mystic &amp; withdrawn tones
      of <u>Passage to India</u>, &amp; of the
      recent poems &amp; prose seem to me to be a gain, as serving the same, &amp; not
      other, purposes but for other <u>moments</u>,  other moods &amp;
      natures,—&amp; I think many of your future readers may gain an entrance to
      your earlier writings through your later &amp; that for some persons this will be
      the fittest way—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>At present I have little doubt you ought not to <u>set
         yourself</u> to any brain-work, but at the same time you ought not to think of
      ceasing to write, for every now &amp; again the mood will come, &amp; you will write
      something as admirable as anything you have written heretofore. Your friends here
      want to think of you as free from all pressure to write, &amp; anxieties about
      material well-being, with your spirit open to all pleasant &amp; good influences the
      Earth, &amp; the Season, &amp; your own thoughts bring to you. The Newspaper
      paragraph you sent Rossetti &amp; me has made us  fear it may not be so with you, &amp; we
      remain in suspense as to whether we might not make some move which would relieve us
      from some of this dissatisfied feeling on your behalf. Ought it not to be a duty,
      too, of—not the American public to recognize your gift to America as a writer
      but—the American Government to recognize your services, as of one who saved
      the lives, &amp; lightened the sufferings of many American citizens—It would
      be honourable to the Government &amp; to you. I write knowing little of the actual
      probability of this, but I believe in England we would be careful of such a
      voluntary public servant.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are all well, my wife &amp; children &amp; <u>I</u>.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>).
