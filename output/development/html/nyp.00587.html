   <p>Yours of June 28 just rec'd,<sup><a href="#nyp.00587_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; welcomed. I forgot
      what I wrote ab't the P[all] M[all] Gaz.<sup><a href="#nyp.00585_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>—but it was not for publication, (&amp; especially not as coming from me.) I
      consider myself as most handsomely treated all round, by friends &amp; upholders in
      Britain &amp; in America—We are having fearfully hot weather here &amp; I am
      suffering from it—Just at this moment it is clouded—a great
      relief—H Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r4">4</a></sup> is here finishing his portrait of me
      to take back to England—it is mighty good both as likeness &amp; work—I
      am writing a little—small bits—will post them to you, when
      printed—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="nyp.00585_n2">3. On May 6, 1887, William
      T. Stead, editor of the <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em>, printed an
      excerpt from a private correspondent (probably Moncure D. Conway) alleging that
      Americans were not as generous as they should be in their gifts to Walt Whitman.
      Herbert Gilchrist, the son of Anne Gilchrist and an artist of sorts, arrived in
      New York on May 27, and appeared in Camden on June 3. For the next several
      months Gilchrist worked on the portrait now in the Rare Book Department of the
      University of Pennsylvania. It is reproduced in Harold W. Blodget and Sculley
      Bradley, eds., <em>Comprehensive Reader's Edition</em> (New York:
      New York University Press, 1965) and in Edwin Haviland Miller, <em>The Artistic Legacy of Walt Whitman </em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1970), figure 25. For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt
