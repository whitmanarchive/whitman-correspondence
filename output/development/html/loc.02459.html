      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Old Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The American mail this morning brought me three most welcome letters—one from
      Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup>, one from your dear niece Jessie Whitman<sup><a href="#n1055" id="r3">3</a></sup>, &amp; best of all another kind postcard from <u>you</u><sup><a href="#loc.02459_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>, for which I thank you
      very heartily—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>From it I was rejoiced to learn that you were (on Jan 5th) apparently so much better
      in health—"comfortable with me still writing a little for
      publication"—and in such good spirits.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I sincerely trust that this improvement will continue</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>&amp; that there may be no recurrence of your troubles.</p>
   
   
   <p>I 
      shewed
      
       your p.c. to Thos Sharrock<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r5">5</a></sup> in the Police Court where
      I had to appear as a medical witness this morning &amp; where T S—who is one
      of "the Boys"—is Clerk to the Magistrates Clerk &amp; immediately afterwards I
      took it to J.W.W.'s<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r6">6</a></sup> office. He 
      shewed
      
       me a long &amp; interesting letter he had just recd from Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r7">7</a></sup> in which the Dr said that he had dislocated his left shoulder
      but was getting on all right with it. He also 
      shewed
      
       me the letter he is sending you by this mail, in which he pays a
      deservedly high tribute to our mutual &amp; much-loved friend Fred Wild<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r8">8</a></sup></p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>In a letter to me Fred says that he takes our gift of L of G<sup><a href="#loc.02459_n3" id="r9">9</a></sup> as a token &amp; a further Link of Love between us. He
      also says:—"I have sent my warmest love to W.W. by Wallace. Do you also
      remember me. I pray I may become worthy of being one of his friends &amp; lovers."
      This desire of Fred's I gladly forward to you for a more loyal &amp; true hearted
      friend than he man never had.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am glad you like "<u>The Review of Reviews</u>"<sup><a href="#loc.07871_n2" id="r10">10</a></sup>, which J.W.W. 
      have
      
       agreed to send you conjointly every month if you will kindly accept of it.
      The Jan. no. goes by this mail.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I also send you a copy—written by Wentworth Dixon<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r11">11</a></sup>—of
      another good letter I have this week received from J.A. Symonds<sup><a href="#n0615" id="r12">12</a></sup>, which I think will interest you
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Herbert Gilchrist says (on Jan 5th) that he "hoped to see you in a couple of weeks"
      &amp; I trust you had a good time together
   </p>
   
   
   <p>J.W.W. has received the paper you sent (<u>Once a Week</u> I think
      it is[)] &amp; thanks you for it
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Our second "glum" treat comes off tonight—</p>
   
   
   <p>The frost, wh. seemed to be going when I last wrote has returned in all its severity
      &amp; we have had more snow.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This has been a glorious day here—hard frost, &amp; snow with brilliant
      sunshine &amp; blue sky. J.W.W. &amp; F.W. intended going for a delightful walk in
      Rivington &amp; much do I regret that my professional duties have prevented my
      accompanying them.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Again expressing the hope that you are keeping better &amp; with kindest regards to
      all your houselhold &amp; best love to yourself
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton

      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of

   <p id="n6121">6. James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the

   <p id="n0119">7. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n0615">12. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
