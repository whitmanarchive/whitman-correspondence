      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir:—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you a copy of the <u>Yale</u> <u>Lit</u> for Nov 74 containing an article "W. W." You will see at a glance that it is simply
      a condensed [illegible] of Mr. Burroughs' "Notes"—a <em>Westminster Review</em> Article [
      <span class="unclear">abt?</span>]
       your <em>Democratic Vistas</em>.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have not sent it to you before because somehow or other I have not had the courage.
      I feared lest what you have said in "Calamus"—your cautions to would be pupils of
      yours—might be true.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I hope that you will not be offended at the imperfect way in which I have tried to
      express my faith in you. I first became acquainted with your books some four or five
      years ago and from them I have not only learned faith &amp; courage but have become desirous
      of seeing you yourself. This last pleasure has been denied me; but one of the pleasantest
      memories of my life is the recollection of an hour passed with your mother in the
      summer of '72.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>The passage marked ] is disjointed, for the false delicacy of the Ed's of <u>Lit</u> kept out some remarks upon the physical degeneracy of our women.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Philip Hale (1854–1934), a music critic and
      program annotator for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, wrote to Walt Whitman for
      the first time on  (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], 3:533). Hale wrote again on October 7, 1875
       (The Library of
      Congress), to praise the "Calamus" poems and to enclose a copy of "Walt
      Whitman," which he published in the <em>Yale Literary
         Magazine</em> in November 1874, 96–104. Walt Whitman sent <em>Two Rivulets</em> to Hale on September 3, 1876 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book).
