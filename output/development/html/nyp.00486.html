   <p>Yours just 
      rec'd—The printers are very slow—but will be coming along in a day
      [or] two—have a sudden rush—the American reprint "Encyclopædia
      Brittanica"—I send you by express a little package of books—the three
      Vols. of my own writing you keep—&amp; give away, or do what you are a mind to
      with<sup><a href="#nyp.00486_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—The Elze? book<sup><a href="#nyp.00486_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—(have you run foul of it before? I guess not)—I send to while away
      unoccupied hours—keep it as long as you stay in Providence—then return
      it to me here.

   <p>Your 27th M[arch] letter has pleased me well—as all your letters
      do—Wm, let me know how the Heywood affair gets on, or turns out, as you
      hear from it—We (I and McKay) have been somewhat at a loss what to do in
      it—whether to send on some money ($20 or so)—or whether to
      remain entirely aloof &amp; silent (&amp; send no money)—I finally
      concluded on the latter—&amp; I am quite clear that is the right course
      for me—mainly because it <em>satisfies</em> me best, upon
      the whole<sup><a href="#nyp.00486_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—What you say <em>about
         Mrs Spofford's say</em> lubricates my soul like precious ointment<sup><a href="#nyp.00486_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00486_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd April 1/83." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Care Dr W F Channing | 98
      Congdon Street | Providence | Rhode Island. It is postmarked: Philadelphia | Mar
      | 29 | 5(?) PM | Pa.; Providence | Mar | 30 | 6 AM | R.I.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00486_n2">2. In his reply on , O'Connor informed Whitman that he had
      given copies of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and <em>Specimen Days</em> to the Channings (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915],
      2:258).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00486_n3">3. O'Connor was thoroughly
      acquainted with the writings of Karl Elze (1821–1889), whom he termed "a
      perfect Bismarck philistine" (Traubel, 2:259). Probably Whitman sent Elze's <em>Essays on Shakespeare</em> (1874). The question mark after
      Elze in the text is Whitman's.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00486_n4">4. See the letter from
      Whitman to O'Connor of . Though
      O'Connor considered Heywood "a stupendous jackass," as he wrote in his letter of
      , he was anxious to have him acquitted
      (Traubel, 3:566). On  he approved of
      Whitman's course of inaction (Traubel, 2:260).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00486_n5">5. On  O'Connor reported that Harriet Prescott
      Spofford (1835–1921), novelist and poet, considered Whitman "the only poet
      that ever lived who has done justice to woman" (Traubel, 3:564).<a href="#r5">[back]
