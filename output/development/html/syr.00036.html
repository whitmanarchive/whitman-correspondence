   <p>Well that wonderfull snowstorn did not amount to much after all, made very
      indifferent sleighing and today the sun is out bright and warm and the snow is going
      again as fast as it can. [—] Your good, heartily welcomed letter of 19<u>th</u> &amp; 20<u>th</u> came to hand this
      forenoon, by the same mail came also your bundle of "Critic"<sup><a href="#syr.00036_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and "Press"<sup><a href="#syr.00036_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> also a bundle

      collection which bids fair to be one day the envy of millionaires. The "Springfield

      well—better than the critic piece which (to me) has a smack of unrealness,
      want of sincerity (but perhaps I do the writer injustice).<sup><a href="#syr.00036_n10" id="r12">12</a></sup> [—] Yes, dear Walt, you must be tired, horribly
      tired, of that room of yours—I really think that when the warm spring days
      come you must move downstairs and by means of some contrivance get into a suitable
      carriage and have a look again at the grass and trees—if you are not worse
      than at present if can be done and ought to be done, and if any thing will revive
      you that will.—Yes I shall be right glad to see the big book<sup><a href="#n4188" id="r13">13</a></sup> in its permanent
      cover and shall depend on you for as early a copy as possible. Nothing more definite
      about trip East, still hope to get off 4 Feb

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="syr.00036_n4">5. The San Francisco <em>Bulletin</em> [date?] contained a brief notice of <em>November Boughs</em>. Whitman commented: "—a notice
      hardly of moment . . ." (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in

   <p id="syr.00036_n6">7. This letter provides a
      good illustration of Whitman's and Traubel's tenacity and thoroughness in
      sending Bucke relevant material from periodicals. Eventually, Bucke had "over
      two thousand newspaper cuttings, [and] nearly four hundred magazine articles" in
      his Whitman collection (Bucke to Charles N. Elliot, 10 June 1897:
      Feinberg:LC).<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="n0915">10. Franklin B. Sanborn
      (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
      he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
      the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
      reviewed <em>Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Boston
         Commonwealth</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00059.html">February 24, 1866</a>. He was editor of the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
      his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
      appeared without Sanborn's name in the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K. Walker,

   <p id="n4188">13. Whitman often referred to <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888) as his "big book." With
      the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made the presswork and binding decisions,
      and Frederick Oldach bound the volume, which included a profile photo of the
      poet on the title page. Philadelphia publisher David McKay published the book in
      December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0141b">14. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
