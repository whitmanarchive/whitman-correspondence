      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As you know I am in Brooklyn. I will not write about coming here. Jeff<sup><a href="#n4995" id="r1">1</a></sup> started back for St Louis this afternoon he was very sorry that
      he could not see you. but I am certainly coming on my way back. Davis is going to
      leave St L– to build the W W of Lowell Mass. it is a very sudden move and made Jeff
      have to return sooner than he expected.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hear from Hattie<sup><a href="#n0911" id="r2">2</a></sup> every few days they get along nicely, and I
      think the trip will do me good I want to remain in Brooklyn till Davis comes on and
      then I will come to Washington
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Walter dont put yourself out too much to get me a room. you know I am not particular
      and for a few days anything will do. I want to see you very much and as that will
      be
      soon I wont write a long letter as I can talk so much better.
