      <br></br><br></br>Dear William O'Connor,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I take it by the enclosed from Rossetti<sup><a href="#nyp.00282_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> that he has sent me the <em>Westminster</em> by mail to Washington, &amp; that it is now there, probably in the A. G. office. You
      go down &amp; see, &amp; get it to read. (May be in p. o.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother's health is about reëstablished if nothing unfavorable occurs.<sup><a href="#nyp.00282_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I shall return to Washington early next week. I start this afternoon for New Haven
      for one day only—an emergency—an artist friend of mine is very low there with consumption—is
      in fact dying—&amp; has expressed the most earnest wish to see me<sup><a href="#nyp.00282_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—We have been, &amp; are, having a cold easterly rain storm here—I enclose, on loan, the
      last two photos of my most sweetly philosophic &amp; fascinating self—(for you to gaze
      upon till I return)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The <em>Swinburne Hilliard</em> article has been copied in the <em>World</em>,<sup><a href="#nyp.00282_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> <em>Home Journal</em>, &amp;c. &amp;c.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Not a word of the <em>Westminster</em> article<sup><a href="#nyp.00282_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—The ungodly, (sorely tried,) will of course endeavor to ignore it, &amp; leave it entirely
      unmentioned &amp; uncommented on, if possible—but that will <em>not</em> be possible—It is a powerful essay—I have been reading it over carefully a second
      time—It strikes the true chords—even the name "<em>The Poetry of Democracy</em>" &amp;c—is it not pregnant? from your loving old
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00282_n1">1. Whitman responded personally
      to William Michael Rossetti on .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00282_n2">2. Probably because of
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's health, Jeff and his family visited her in the fall;
      Martha visited her mother-in-law in the spring or early summer. Martha and her
      children went to Camden to see George's wife Louisa, whom he had married on
      April 14, 1871. On , Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman wrote to Walt Whitman: "george and loo and Jeff insists on my
      breaking up 
      houskeeping
      
      . they 
      dident
      
       only insist but almost commanded me. i told them i should remain here
      this winter (if i lived). they none of them want edd, walter, and they would
      soon get tired of paying his board and we aint much 
      expence
      
       to any but you, walter dear, for any thing but houseroom."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00282_n3">3. Charles Hine, a painter
      to whom Whitman wrote on . On  Hine's wife informed Whitman of her
      husband's death: "I think after your visit to him that his hold on life seemed
      to give way and his yearnings were all accomplished." Mrs. Hine, who visited
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman on August 22, 1871, thought it "strange" that Whitman
      did not write. According to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter of , Mrs. Hine had received a
      "donation" from Walt Whitman. Whitman also wrote of Charles Hine's illness in
      his  letter to Peter Doyle.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00282_n4">4. The New York <em>World</em> of July 24, 1871, reprinted Lucy Fountain's
      article, "An Evening with Swinburne" (retitled "Swinburne at Home") from the
      August <em>Galaxy</em>, 12 (1871), 231–234, in which
      Swinburne's favorable comments on Whitman were reported. The reference to
      Hilliard is unclear, although Hilliear was perhaps the real name of the
      author.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00282_n5">5. An unsigned article by
      Edward Dowden (a professor of English literature at the University of Dublin;
      see also Whitman's  letter to
      Dowden) in the <em>Westminster Review</em>, 96 (1871),
      33–68. Whitman wrote glowingly about the piece in his  letter to William O'Connor.<a href="#r5">[back]
