      <br></br><br></br>My Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It seems quite a long while since I wrote, &amp; a <em>very long</em> while since you wrote.<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r1">1</a></sup> I am beginning to turn my thoughts Philadelphia-wards that we may have some weeks
      near you before we set out on fresh wanderings across the sea; and though I feel quite
      cheery about them, I look eagerly forward to the time beyond that when we have a fixed,
      final nest of our own again, where we can welcome you just when and as you please.
      Whichever side the Atlantic it is, you will come surely? for you belong to the one
      country as much as to the other. And I shall always feel that I do too. I take back
      with me a deep and hearty love for America—I came indeed with a good deal of that,
      but what I take back is different—stronger, more real. I went over to see friends
      in Brooklyn yesterday, &amp; it was more lovely than I can tell you on the Ferry—in fact,
      it was just your poem, "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry". Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> still painting away <em>con amore</em>, &amp; making good progress. I met Joaquin Miller<sup><a href="#n0412" id="r3">3</a></sup> at the Bigelows last week, &amp; he was very pleasant (which isn't always the case) and
      said some very good things to me. Thursday we are going to lunch with Mrs. Albert
      Brown—perhaps you may have heard of her as Bessie Griffiths. She was a Southern lady
      who, when she was about 18, freed all her slaves &amp; left herself penniless. On Sunday
      we take tea at Prof. Rood's of Columbia College. Kate Hillard<sup><a href="#n0302" id="r4">4</a></sup> we often see &amp; have lively chats with. We meet also &amp; see a good deal of General
      Edward Lee<sup><a href="#n3008" id="r5">5</a></sup>—a fine soldierly looking man, &amp; I believe he distinguished himself in the war &amp; was
      afterwards sent to organize the new Territory of Wyoming, &amp; was the first governor.
      I wish very much that if you or your brother knew him or know anything about him,
      you would tell me—for reasons that I will tell you by &amp; bye. Bee<sup><a href="#n0260" id="r6">6</a></sup> is seeing a great deal of the educated coloured people at Boston—was at the meeting
      of a literary club—the only white among 20 or 30 coloured ladies—likes them much.
   </p>

      Write soon, dear Friend. Meanwhile, best love &amp; good-bye.
      <br></br>Anne Gilchrist.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>No letters from England this long while.</p>
   
   
   <p>Please give friendly greetings from me to your brother &amp; sister.</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0259">1. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">2. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0412">3. Joaquin Miller was the pen name of Cincinnatus Heine
      Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of the Rockies" and
      "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <em>Westminster Review</em>
      described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness which marked Walt Whitman's
      poetry." In an entry in his journal dated August 1, 1871, John Burroughs
      recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's poetry; see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin Co., 1931), 60. Whitman met Miller for the first time later in 1872; he
      wrote of a visit with Miller in a 
      letter to Charles W. Eldridge.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0302">4. Katharine Hillard (1839?–1915) was the translator of
      Dante's <em>Banquet</em> (1889) and the editor of <em>An Abridgment by Katharine Hillard of the Secret Doctrine: A
         Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy by Helena Petrovna
         Blavatsky</em> (1907). A Brooklyn resident, she was a friend of Abby Price
      (see Whitman's , letter to
      Price); in fact, according to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter to Helen Price
      on November 26, 1872, the Prices expected that Arthur Price and Katharine
      Hillard would marry (Pierpont Morgan Library). Whitman had known Hillard's
      writings since 1871 and mentioned her in his , letter to Charles Eldridge. He sent her a copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> on July 27, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book). Writing to Whitman on ,
      Moncure D. Conway quoted from a letter sent to him by Katharine Hillard: "I have
      made a discovery since I have been here [in the Adirondacks], and that is, that
      I never half appreciated Walt Whitman's poetry till now, much as I fancied I
      enjoyed it. To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the only
      one who can reach and level their lift, to use his own words, to pass and
      continue beyond" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell
      Kennerley, 1914], 3:112). The first meeting of the poetess with Whitman took
      place on February 28, 1876.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n3008">5. Edward M. Lee was appointed
      territorial secretary of Wyoming on 25th of July 1868. See <em>Report of the Governor of Wyoming Territory Made to the Secretary of the
         Interior on the Year 1878</em> (Washington D.C.: Government Printing Office,
      1878), 1663.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n0260">6. Beatrice Carwardine Gilchrist (1854–1881) was
      the second child (and first daughter) of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist. An
      aspiring physician, Beatrice took the needed preparatory classes but was barred
      (as were all women) from becoming a medical student in England. As a result, she
      attended the Women's Medical College in Philadelphia. She held positions as a
      physician in Berne, Switzerland, and later Edinburgh before committing suicide
      by fatally ingesting hydrocyanic acid in 1881.<a href="#r6">[back]
