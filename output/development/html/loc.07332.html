   <p>Yours of 7<u>th</u><sup><a href="#loc.07332_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> to hand last evening. It was (as always)

      been under the sod fifteen months ago—at least. I was real glad to get Miss

      was also glad to get the cutting re Browning<sup><a href="#n0116" id="r6">6</a></sup> who seems to have been a mighty fine
      fellow.<sup><a href="#loc.07332_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup> I sh<u>d</u> like to know whether he was really of
      Jewish stock (as they say) I think it more than likely I believe that is the
      greatest stock of all and am never surprised to find that it is an element in a
      great man. Well, we still have La Grippe here though things are mending a little
      with us. The doctors are all
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>out of bed again but are a long way from up to par yet. There are still many members
      of the staff (attendants &amp;c) who are sick or half sick. I hope hope however we
      are over the worst of it. Willy Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r8">8</a></sup> is mending, is able to sit
      up now. The children are mostly better but some of them ailing yet. I have opened
      an
      infirmary for 40 patients—20 men and 20 women—within the last few
      days—this has been making a little extra work lately so that La Grippe struck
      us in a bad time—but we will worry along and after a little we shall get into
      daylight again.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">5. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

      poet known for his dramatic monologues, including "Porphyria's Lover" and "My
      Last Duchess." Browning was also the husband of poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning
      (1806–1861).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n4284">8. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
