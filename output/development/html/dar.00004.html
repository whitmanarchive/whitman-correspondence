      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Emerson:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>On the eve of sending the enclosed piece<sup><a href="#dar.00004_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> abroad, I have taken a notion to first offer it to 
      the <em>Atlantic</em>—and, if not too great a liberty, to solicit your services for that purpose.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I would be much obliged if you would take it in to Mr. Fields<sup><a href="#dar.00004_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> the first time you go to Boston—show him this letter—If available at all, I propose
      it for about the February number of the magazine. 
      The price is $100, &amp; 30 copies of the number in which it may be printed—and I will
      ask Mr. Fields 
      to do me the favor to send me an answer within a week from the time he receives the
      piece—or perhaps he can give his decision at once on receiving it.<sup><a href="#dar.00004_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With best respect &amp; love,
      <br></br>Walt Whitman.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>The piece appears in printed form because I have had it put in type for my own convenience,
      
      and to insure greater correctness—I forgot to say, above, that I scrupulously reserve
      the 
      right to print this piece in future in my book—(which, however, will not be for several
      months.)

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ralph Waldo Emerson
      (1803–1882) was an American poet and essayist who began the
      Transcendentalist movement with his 1836 essay <em>Nature</em>.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="dar.00004_n1">1. Walt Whitman sent
      "Proud Music of the Sea-Storm" (later called "Proud Music of the Storm"),
      which James T. Fields, editor of the <em>Atlantic
         Monthly</em>, promptly accepted for the magazine; the poem appeared in the
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00014.html">February 1869</a> issue of the magazine.<br><br>
      In 1888 Horace Traubel asked Whitman why he had appealed "to Emerson as a
      mediator": "For several reasons, I may say. But the best reason I had was in
      his own suggestion that I should permit him to do such things for me when
      the moment seemed ripe for it" (Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.6.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996],
      2:22).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="dar.00004_n2">2. James T. Fields
      (1817–1881) succeeded James Russell Lowell as editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>. After Emerson delivered the poem to
      him, Fields sent $100 to Whitman on . He informed Whitman on  that if he was to get the poem into the February issue it would
      be impossible to send proof to Washington. This was the second of Whitman's
      poems to appear in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>; <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00033.html">"Bardic Symbols"</a> was published in the <em>Atlantic
         Monthly</em> of April 1860. See also Whitman's  letter to James Russell Lowell and his  letter to the editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="dar.00004_n3">3. Whitman reported receipt of
      $100 in his  letter to Fields, in
      which he also indicated that he had not yet received the 30 copies of the <em>Atlantic</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
