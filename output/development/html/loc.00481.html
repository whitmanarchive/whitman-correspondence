      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I received your letter<sup><a href="#loc.00481_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> the other day—also the papers
      with enclosures—and glad I was to hear from you again &nbsp;Probably as Jess has told
      you I am poking around from place to place spending about 1/3 of my time on Rail Road
      trains<sup><a href="#loc.00481_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—and although it is not as bad as it might be
      yet I cannot say that I enjoy it much—suppose I would if I was fifteen years
      younger—but it is as it is<sup><a href="#loc.00481_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>We are having a bad snow storm here to-day—and I 
      hav'nt
      
       been out yet—but I think I will walk over and look at  the lake which I
      suppose is kicking up considerable of a bobbery just about now &nbsp;The Milwaukee bay
      is a
      first rate place to see the waves dash on the shore it being about this shape<sup><a href="#loc.00481_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup><br><br><img class="teiFigure" src="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/figures/loc.00481.001.jpg"><br><br> and when the wind is blowing stiff from the East you can see a wave start in
      at <u>A</u> and follow it for two or three miles as it passes
      B—that is except at the points at the mouth of the river or where the projecting
      piers are. When a fellow feels good it is lots of fun to see them—but just to day
      I 
      dont
      
       feel first class &nbsp;Kinder lonely—been in too much I suppose—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am up here engaged in the almost hopeless task of trying to determine what can be
      done
      with the sewage of the town. Just now it is all emptied into the river that flows
      through the city and the deposit has become so great that in the summer it is terribly
      offensive to those who live along the edge of the river
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall be here, off and on probably, five or six months—that is if the infernal
      thing 
      dont
      
       worry me to death
   </p>
   
   <p>I judge from your letter that you are holding your own fairly well—of course we
      are all getting older 
      and as you say the machine will show wear, never so well may we patch it up. But I
      feel
      very much like our old friend Ruggles<sup><a href="#loc.00481_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> used to say, "we must
      make the best of it"
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope, dear Walt, that you will keep in good spirits during the bad weather—I
      find in my own case that it is the hardest thing I have to combat—I often think
      that the only fellow that knows how to live is the wild-goose &nbsp;He makes the world
      his
      own and follows the climate he likes—and no question of business can keep him
      either &nbsp;Well good by Walt—write me whenever you feel like it &nbsp;I always want to
      know how you are
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

      Whitman this information when she visited him in Camden in October 1887 (<em>Walt Whitman: Daybooks and Notebooks</em>, ed. William White

   <p id="loc.00481_n3">3. In May 1887 M. L.
      Holman succeeded Jeff as water commissioner. Jeff's authority may have been
      weakened by the resolution adopted on February 18, 1887, by the lower house of
      the city assembly: "Resolved by the House of Delegates, the Council concurring
      therein, that the Water Commissioner be informed that the continued practice of
      furnishing the comsumers of water with a filthy, unsettled substance for the
      purpose of extracting influence in support of an ordinance to extend the present
      water system, the the [<em>sic</em>] said extension having for its
      purpose the perpetuation in office of barnacles whose places can be better
      filled by just as practical men, who will be glad to do their duty—should they
      be appointed—is dicountenanced by the Municipal Assembly, and the Water
      Commissioner is hereby respectfully requested to serve his purpose by means
      other than those calculated to inconvenience the taxpayers of the city" (<em>Journal of the City Council</em>, February 23, 1887).<a href="#r3">[back]
