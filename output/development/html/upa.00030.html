   <p>I have just been reading your Monday's note for the second time—&amp; will write a line
      in rejoinder, with my French water pen, moistened out of the gurgling brook, just
      as I sit here, half shade, half in the warm sun, as I sit here after my lavations.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still pretty well,—Still enjoy my natural days here, by the creek—(but they are
      now drawing to a close)—Nothing new.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—The papers have all arrived I think—the <u>News</u>, with the Plevna battle letter, &amp;c. I have here to day, &amp; am reading with interest.
      Herby is well &amp; brown—Shall be up in 
      
      
      
      good time to be with with my dear neices &amp; all of you—I wonder if you have the same splendor of days &amp; nights as we here the
      week past.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you will have Edward Carpenter's letter to Herby by this time &amp; will find
      it indeed cheery &amp; interesting.<sup><a href="#upa.00030_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00030_n1">1. This letter was written
      shortly before Whitman's return to Camden on September 10, probably on Tuesday,
      September 4. On September 3 the New York <em>Tribune</em> noted
      the fighting between the Turks and Russians near Plevna.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="upa.00030_n2">2. Carpenter returned to
      England late in June (see Whitman's letter to John Burroughs on ).<a href="#r2">[back]
