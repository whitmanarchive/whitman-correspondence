      <br></br><br></br>My dear William &amp; Nelly O'Connor,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I write a few lines to tell you how I find the folks at home—Both my mother &amp; brother
      George looked much better than I expected—Mother is quite well, considering—she goes
      about her household affairs pretty much the same as ever, &amp; is cheerful.
   </p>
   
   <p>My brother would be in what I would almost call fair condition, if it were not that
      his legs are affected—it seems to me it is rheumatism, following the fever he had<sup><a href="#nyp.00198_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—but I don't know—He goes to bed quite sleepy &amp; falls to sleep—but then soon wakes,
      &amp; frequently little or no more sleep that night—he most always leaves the bed, &amp; comes
      downstairs, &amp; passes the night on the sofa. He goes out most every day though—some
      days has to lay by—He is going to report to Annapolis promptly when his furlough is
      up—I told him I had no doubt I could get it extended, but he does not wish it—He says
      little, but is in first rate spirits.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am feeling finely—&amp; never enjoyed a visit home more than I am doing this.</p>
   
   <p>I find myself perplexed about printing my book. All the printers tell me I could not
      pick a more inopportune time—that in ten days prices of paper, composition &amp;c will
      all be very much lower &amp;c. I shall decide tomorrow.
   </p>
   
   <p>My brother Jeff wishes me to give you his sincerest thanks for your good will &amp;c in
      the matter of the engineer's situation—Mother says he has talked much about it, &amp;
      feels your kindness in it thoroughly.<sup><a href="#nyp.00198_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Martha &amp; the little girls are well. My sister at Burlington Vt. is not well, &amp; mother
      will probably pay a long visit there this summer.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived with
      William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later John
      Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington years.
      William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor often complained about the
      various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his death. However, his
      government work was relieved by the presence of Whitman, whom he was to love and
      venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
      vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
      pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
      important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
      those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
      O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
      sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
      first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910], 513). For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see Deshae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>.

   <p id="nyp.00198_n2">2. About March 5, 1865, Mrs.
      Whitman described George's illness in prison camp: "he was very sick at one
      time. i think it was in january with the lung fever. he was six weeks in the
      hospital so bad that the doctor thought he would die . . . he was dilerious and
      lay in a stupor till the night the fever turned. he says he felt a thrill run
      through him and thought he was dying. he was in the dark. he cald to one of the
      nurses to bring a light and to raise him up and give him a piece of paper and
      pencil and he wrote to me that was his last night and what was due him from the
      goverment" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books,
      Manuscript, and Special Collections Library; Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G.
      Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections</em> [Durham,

   <p id="nyp.00198_n3">3. O'Connor recommended Jeff
      for a position as a "draughtsman," but Jeff, in a letter to O'Connor on , declined because of lack of
      experience.<a href="#r3">[back]
