      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.04037_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I enclose $5 for the past (over) a weeks board. (God bless you for your many sisterly
      kindnesses to me, which no money can ever repay. My love to Ed and Debby and the whole
      family.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I am going up &amp; may not be down again soon, I wish Debby to take charge of my big
      pillow, as it was made by &amp; given me by my mother, &amp; she slept on it &amp; I shall want
      it again. I may want the stove, to use, this winter, but don't know. The bedstead
      I give to Debbie if she will accept it—it an't worth much any how.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04037_n1">1. This draft letter was
      probably sent shortly after Whitman's visit from November 29 to December 6,
      1878. He was not with the Staffords again until July 2, 1879 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). When he stayed with
      Susan Stafford, he ordinarily paid her $5 a week for his board.<a href="#r1">[back]
