   <p>Your two <u>postcards</u> just recd.<sup><a href="#n1027" id="r2">2</a></sup> Nothing
      further as yet, but packages sometimes take a day or two longer to get to me. Sorry
      you didn't receive the piece of translation—sent it with a letter a good time
      ago &amp; was rather wondering I hadn't heard from you about it.<sup><a href="#loc.05141_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> Am working away at it with full steam up &amp; feel that
      it looks promising. Will defer lecture till it is nearer completion. Rees Welsh &amp;
      Co all hail! May your shadows never grow less! Will get prose book as soon as it
      appears.<sup><a href="#loc.05141_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> Will write soon as pictures arrive. Many
      thanks.

   <p id="n1027">2. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05141_n2">3. Apparently Whitman had
      misplaced the page of translations Rolleston had sent him. See the letter from
      Rolleston to Whitman of .<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.05141_n3">4. The 1881 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> published in Boston was banned by the
      Society for the Suppression of Vice. In May 1882, Osgood ceased publication of
      the edition, and Rees Welsh and Company reprinted it the same year. In addtion
      to <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, Rees Welsh and Company published <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em> (Philadelphia, 1882–83).
      It is the latter book to which Rolleston refers here and the receipt of which he
      acknowledges in his letter to Whitman of .<a href="#r4">[back]
