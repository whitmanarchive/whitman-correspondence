   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00881_n1">1. On , Henry Alden, the editor of <em>Harper's New Monthly Magazine</em>, requested a poem. Whitman sent "," and was paid $25 on September 1, 1889 (<em>The Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.). The poem accompanied an engraving of George Inness' "The Valley of the
      Shadow of Death" (1867); see LeRoy Ireland, <em>The Works of
         George Inness</em> (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1965), 98–99.
      When <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00028.html">the poem appeared in April 1892</a>, the frontispiece of the magazine was a
      photograph of Alexander's portrait of Whitman, and above the poem appeared a
      more recent sketch of the poet by the same artist. A partial facsimile of this
      manuscript appears in Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.53.html">Thursday, May 30, 1889</a>. See also "Death's Valley" (loc.00189) in the
