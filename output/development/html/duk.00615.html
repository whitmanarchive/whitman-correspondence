   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00615_n1">1. This letter dates to May 5
      or May 6, 1873. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to the year 1873. This
      letter is probably the "short letter of yesterday" that Walt Whitman mentioned
      in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman. In addition, this letter acknowledged Louisa's receipt Saturday of $5
      that Walt had sent on Thursday or Friday. Although Walt's letter sending the $5
      is not extant, in his  letter he had
      promised to enclose the money in "my next [letter]." Walt in his reply to this
      letter worried about his mother's condition, a concern elicited by the shortness
      of this letter, the deficiency of her handwriting, and her report of "a
      trembling in my whole system" (see Walt's ). If Louisa received Walt's Thursday or Friday letter on
      Saturday, May 3, and she had received another letter ("one to today") from Walt,
      this letter—the "short letter" that elicited Walt's worried May 7
      response—dates to May 5 or May 6, 1873.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n3">2. Walt Whitman in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      promised to send "the other 5 in my next," but his Thursday or Friday letter
      from that week is not extant (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:217).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n4">3. Walt Whitman in his  letter responded, "I feel so bad, you
      are not well." He inquired whether rest or better food could help, and he
      promised to "come on about the 1st of next month."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n6">4. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n7">5. The "aunt" who was engaged
      to assist Louisa "Lou" Orr Haslam has not been identified. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman described Lou's aunt as English, and Louisa was not fond of the aunt's
      company: "i wouldent be very sorry if aunty wasent here" (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). She is named "aunt Lib" and "aunt Libby" in Louisa's  and  letters to Walt.<a href="#r5">[back]
