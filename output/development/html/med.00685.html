      <br></br><br></br>Dear John Burroughs,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Postal of 18th just rec'd, &amp; glad enough to hear from you all—the interval has been a long one—I supposed you
      were off some where—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing special with me—After I returned from N Y middle of June, went down to my
      Jersey farm friends a couple of weeks—but they have moved into a new place, superior
      for their purposes, but to me the attraction had ceased, &amp; I left—Otherwise have been
      here in Camden all summer (I feel now as though I ought to have gone up &amp; room'd in
      your house &amp; boarded with Smith<sup><a href="#sjs.00008_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> the last two months)—I still keep well—about the same as when you last saw me—may
      be a trifle ruggeder yet—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>All here well—I enclose you two letters from Mrs Gilchrist<sup><a href="#sjs.00008_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> in England, &amp; one from my friend Mrs Botta,<sup><a href="#sjs.00008_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> may interest you—I shall send you papers to-morrow—Weather fine yesterday &amp; to-day
      here—&amp; I am out enjoying it—(after fair<sup><a href="#sjs.00008_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> days of pouring rain)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I often see your name, &amp; extracts, (sometimes quite long ones) in the papers hereabouts—</p>
   
   
   <p>Love to 'Sula—</p>

   <p>That Del: river boat trip? Did it come off? You know I have heard nothing about it since<sup><a href="#sjs.00008_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="sjs.00008_n1">1. Burrough's hired hand,
      Smith Caswell.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00008_n2">2. Anne Gilchrist's letters
      of  from Glasgow, and  from Durham, where her son Percy was
      living. Both were letters about her travels and various points of interest (<em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em>, ed.
      Thomas B. Harned [New York: Doubleday, Page &amp; Company, 1918],
      181–185).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00008_n3">3. The poet and sculptor
      Anne Charlotte Lynch Botta (see the letters from Whitman to Botta of  and ). John Burroughs informed Clara Barrus that Whitman attended some
      of Botta's receptions (Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
      186). Whitman sent Botta a photograph and a copy of <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em> on July 20 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00008_n4">4. Whitman undoubtedly
      intended to write "four" or "five." He noted "rainy days &amp; nights" in his
      Commonplace Book from August 16 to 18.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00008_n5">5. See the letter from
      Whitman to John Burroughs of . On
       Burroughs described his trip on the
      Delaware River late in June (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914], 3:260).<a href="#r5">[back]
