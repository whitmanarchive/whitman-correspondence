      <br></br>Dear Sirs:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I sent you "Personalism"<sup><a href="#prc.00019_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—which I suppose you received Monday last. I
      should consider it a favor from you to have the piece set up as soon as convenient,
      first proof carefully read &amp; corrected, &amp; then three sets of proofs
      taken &amp; mailed me here—One set I will read, and return
      immediately.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think of offering the article in England,<sup><a href="#prc.00019_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> probably to
      the Fortnightly Review—but of course any thing over there must be
      strictly subordinated to the appearance of the article here first—that is
      positive.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Can you let me have the proofs within a week or so?</p>
   
   
   <p>I think of asking you $100 for "Personalism." I reserve the right of printing
      it in future book.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How about the little piece "Ethiopia Commenting"?<sup><a href="#prc.00019_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> Will it not be practicable for
      you to print it in the April number? Certain poetical pieces of mine were arranged
      to appear soon in English magazine<sup><a href="#prc.00019_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; I should like the "Ethiopia" to
      precede them.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00019_n1">1. William Conant Church
      (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
      York newspapers until he founded the <em>Army and Navy
         Journal</em> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
      he established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. Financial control of
      the <em>Galaxy</em> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
      was absorbed by the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1878. William
      published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
      Francis wrote for the New York <em>Sun</em> the unsigned piece
      "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." See Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the
      <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952),
      332–350; Donald N. Bigelow, <em>William Conant Church
         &amp;</em> "The Army and Navy Journal" (New York: Columbia University Press,
      1952); J. R. Pearson, Jr., "Story of a Magazine: New York's <em>Galaxy</em>, 1866–1878," <em>Bulletin of the New York
         Public Library</em>, 61 (1957), 217–237, 281–302.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00019_n2">2. Walt Whitman first solicited
      "Personalism" in his  letter to
      the Churches, citing it as a sequel of sorts to "Democracy."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00019_n3">3. Walt Whitman did send
      "Personalism" to Moncure D. Conway in his  letter. Conway later wrote that attempts to market the piece in
      England proved unsuccessful.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00019_n4">4. This poem, sent by Walt
      Whitman with his  letter to the
      Churches, was never published in the <em>Galaxy</em>. It later
      became "Ethiopia Saluting the Colors"; see Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the
      <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952),
      337. Walt Whitman withdrew the poem in his  letter to Francis P. Church.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00019_n5">5. Walt Whitman overstated;
      only "Whispers of Heavenly Death" had been accepted for publication in
      England.<a href="#r5">[back]
