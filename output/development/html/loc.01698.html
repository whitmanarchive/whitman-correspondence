   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01698_n1">1. John Swinton (1829–1901), managing
      editor of the New York <em>Times</em>, frequented Pfaff's beer
      cellar, where he probably met Whitman. On  (Whitman said "1884"), Swinton wrote what the poet termed "almost
      like a love letter": "It was perhaps the very day of the publication of the
      first edition of the 'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of it at a newspaper
      stand in Fulton street, Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it with wonder, and felt
      that here was something that touched on depths of my humanity. Since then you
      have grown before me, grown around me, and grown into me." He praised Whitman in
      the <em>New York Herald</em> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in
      Richard Maurice Bucke, <em>Walt Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1883], 36–37). In 1874, Swinton was a candidate of the Industrial
      Political Party for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with
      the New York <em>Sun</em>, and for the next four years edited the
      weekly labor journal, <em>John Swinton's Paper</em>. When this
      publication folded, he returned to the <em>Sun</em>. See Robert
      Waters, <em>Career and Conversations of John Swinton</em>
      (Chicago, 1902), and Meyer Berger, <em>The History of The New York
         Times</em>, 1851–1951 (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1951),
      250–251.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.01698_n2">2. Since the press had not reported his
      speech before the American Institute sympathetically (see Whitman's  letter to the American Institute),
      Walt Whitman wanted Swinton, who was no longer editor of the New York <em>Times</em>, to place an "official" but anonymous reply in the
      newspapers named. Edwin Haviland Miller had not found the notices. However, at
      Yale there is a detailed answer to the newspaper attacks on this poem which Walt
      Whitman prepared for an unidentified newspaper.<a href="#r2">[back]
