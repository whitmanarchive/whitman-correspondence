   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00749_n1">1. Whitman's dealings
      with Trübner &amp; Co. were handled through Josiah Child. See the
      letter from Whitman to Child of . On , Trübner sent
      Whitman $7.57 in payment for copies of <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>, and noted that 61 copies of that work were still on hand
      (Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On November 8 Whitman recorded that
      Trübner owed him $70 for ten sets and "also something due me for <em>Dem: Vistas</em>." On December 6 he received $47.55 from
      Trübner in payment for six sets and for fifteen (twelve according to
      the letter from Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of ) copies of <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>; the balance due was $28 for four sets and $17.02 for
      forty-six copies of <em>Democratic Vistas</em>.<br><br>
      Whitman received a payment from Trübner through Josiah Child on June 9,
      1879, and an order for books. See the letter from Whitman to Child of . Probably the payment amounted to
      $24.50, since in making a tally of the books in Trübner's possession as
      of June 27, he noted thirty-seven volumes (including thirty-six sent on June
      25 or 27) and forty-six copies of <em>Democratic Vistas</em>.
      On March 4, 1880, he received in payment $37.22; on July 22, 1880, $80.50,
      at which time he sent thirty-four volumes; on March 4, 1881, $105.37, at
      which time he sent an additional twenty volumes; and on December 8, 1881, he
      received $80.50. At that time the balance due was $14.43 for thirty-nine
      copies of <em>Democratic Vistas</em>. At a later date Whitman
      added to this entry, "all paid in full" (Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="man.00050_n1">3. "Dominion" was a designation
      used to describe the provinces of Canada. It was formalized in the Canadian
      Constitution Act, 1867.<a href="#r3">[back]
