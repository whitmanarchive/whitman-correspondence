   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="prc.00120_n2">2. Elizabeth Nelson Fairchild
      (1845–1924) published poetry in several periodicals. She married Charles
      Fairchild in 1868. Elizabeth Fairchild is first mentioned in Whitman's
      correspondence as early as 1883. Whitman met the Fairchilds during his 1881 trip
      to Boston where he was preparing the 1881 edition of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> for publication. By 1887 Elizabeth Fairchild was assisting
      Kennedy with the Boston effort to raise funds to support Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]

      (1832–1903), the sculptor and Unitarian minister, was at the time working
      on a bust of Walt Whitman, a photograph of which would become the frontispiece
      of <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em> in 1889. For
      Morse's full account of the experience, see <em>In Re Walt
         Whitman</em>, ed. Horace Traubel and Thomas B. Harned (Philadelphia: David
