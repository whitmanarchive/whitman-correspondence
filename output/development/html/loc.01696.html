   </p>
   
   
   <p>I take the liberty of writing at a venture to propose to you the publication, in a
      moderate-priced volume, of a full edition of my poems, Leaves of Grass, in England
      under my
      sanction.—I send by same mail with this, a revised copy of L. of G. I should like
      a fair
      remuneration or percentage.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I make this proposition not only to get my poems before the British public, but more
      because I am annoyed at the horrible dismemberment of my book there already &amp; possibility
      of
      something worse.<sup><a href="#loc.01696_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Should my proposal suit you, go right on with the book. Style of getting it up, price,
      rate
      of remuneration to me, &amp;c. I leave entirely to you. Only the text must be sacredly
      preserved, verbatim.<sup><a href="#loc.01696_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Please direct to me here, as soon as convenient.</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01696_n1">1. This is a draft letter. Ellis replied on
      : since there were poems in <em>Leaves of Grass</em> which "would not go down in England," he
      believed that it would "not be worth while to publish it again in a mutilated
      form." On the following day he sent another note and a specially printed copy of
      Swinburne's <em>Songs before Sunrise</em> (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.; Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.85.html">2:448</a>).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01696_n2">2. Whitman referred to his dealings with his
      English publisher Hotten; Whitman described his experiences with Hotten as
      "passive" in a  letter to Moncure
      D. Conway and labeled Hotten a "pirate-publisher" of "a bad &amp; defective
      London reprint" in a  letter to
      Rudolf Schmidt.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01696_n3">3. Following this passage, Whitman deleted:
      "literal—and all your English carefulness in proof-reading, must by
      cap."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
