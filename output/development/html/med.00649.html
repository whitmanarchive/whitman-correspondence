   <p>Well here I am in a grand old hotel, the finest in town—the proprietor Mr
      Ferrin<sup><a href="#med.00649_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> (a stranger too) sent and invited me to stop
      here as the guest of the house &amp; no bill to pay—nice room large, fire in
      it, first rate grub (too good, I am tempted too much)—When I got up this
      morning, snow falling thick &amp; every thing dark &amp; cloudy &amp;
      wintry—but looks a little brighter now—I am feeling pretty
      well—went out around yesterday &amp; last night—great bright stirring
      city, this—great people, these Yankees—I like them—I am used tip
      top here—friends call all the time<sup><a href="#med.00649_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—lecture
      comes off to-night.
   </p>
   
   <p>Saturday Evening Lecture went off first rate last night—best I have had yet,
      better audience (better than New York or Philadelphia)—I am enjoying myself
      well—have been out riding today &amp; shall go again to-morrow. I 
      dont
      
       know
      that I can tell you anything particularly to interest you but I suppose you will
      like to have a word. I am to stop here till Tuesday or Wednesday next. Love to Harry
      &amp; Ed—I send you a paper—
