   <p>. . . As to me, I lead rather a dull life here. I wish you were nearer, that we might
      be together frequently. I do not associate much with the department clerks, yet many
      appear to be good fellows enough. The contest between Congress and the President is
      quite exciting. I go up to the Capitol and listen to the speeches and arguments. Sometimes
      I feel as if one side had the best of it and then the other. Well, my dear comrade,
      I believe I have told you all the news—of Eicholtz,<sup><a href="#med.00315_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> the German sergeant with the bad compound fracture, of Frazee<sup><a href="#med.00315_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> and Dr. Smith.<sup><a href="#med.00315_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anson Ryder, Jr., a
      soldier, had apparently left Armory Square Hospital and returned to his family
      at Cedar Lake, New York, accompanied by another injured soldier named Wood
      (probably Calvin B. Wood; see Edward F. Grier, ed., <em>Notes and
         Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–1984], 6:673).

   <p id="med.00315_n2">1. Hugo Eicholtz was listed
      in the Washington Directory of 1869 and in one of Whitman's address books (The
      Library of Congress # 109). He evidently lived with his mother, a
      dressmaker.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00315_n3">2. Sergeant Hiram W. Frazee,
      Second New York Artillery, was wounded in "one of the last battles near
      Petersburg" (Richard Maurice Bucke, ed., <em>The Complete Writings
         of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 6:236).<a href="#r2">[back]
