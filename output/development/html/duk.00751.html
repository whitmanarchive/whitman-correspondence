      <br></br><br></br>Dear Tom
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was glad to have word from you, once more, &amp; glad to get the particulars of that
      race—this is the first full account I have heard, &amp; I am real pleased, Tommy, first
      at the satisfaction of your winning, and next at your raking in the good stakes—altogether
      it must have been quite a time—
   </p>
   
   
   <p> Yes Dr Bucke was here, and we had a very pleasant afternoon and evening together—had
      a first rate dinner—and then in the hotel sitting room some of the tallest kind of
      talking &amp; arguing you may be sure.<sup><a href="#duk.00751_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I live very quietly &amp; plainly here, board with my brother &amp; sister-in-law—have a nice
      little room up in the third story fronting south (I am sitting here now in a great
      rocking chair, &amp; the sun is pouring in bright and warm as you please—I wish you was
      here, Tommy, to spend the afternoon with me)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have some work to-day, most every day a little, but I take it easy, content if I
      can make enough to pay my expenses—I never cared to be rich, (no possibility of that
      any how) but I dont care to be too poor either.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I get out on the river, (the Delaware) or over in Philadelphia most every day—lately
      I go down to the Ferry at nights &amp; cross over &amp; back two or three times. The river
      is full of ice &amp; the boats have a pretty tough time—but the nights are light, the
      full moon shining like silver, and I enjoy it all—(Know the pilots and boat hands
      intimately.) Last night was perfect, &amp; only middling cool—I staid crossing till 12
      o'clock—felt good—&amp; then got hungry &amp; went and got a dozen nice oysters &amp; a drink
      (Dont that make your mouth water, Tommy boy?) I often think of you and the boys &amp;
      girls—give my best respects to all of them, Dick Flynn, Tom Bradley<sup><a href="#duk.00751_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; all the cricket boys—that was the best summer there in Canada, &amp; among you all
      &amp; the Asylum grounds, &amp; the daily rides into London &amp; all, that I ever put in &amp; I
      am feeling the benefit of it yet. My love to you, Tom, &amp; am glad you dont forget me,
      as I won't you—try to write to me regular—
   </p>
