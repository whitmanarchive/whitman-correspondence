   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>C. Sadakichi Hartmann (ca.
      1867–1944) was an art historian and early critic of photography as an art
      form. He visited Whitman in Camden in the 1880s and published his conversations
      with the poet in 1895. Generally unpopular with other supporters of the poet, he
      was known during his years in Greenwich Village as the "King of Bohemia." For
      more information about Hartmann, see John F. Roche, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_113.html">Hartmann, C. Sadakichi (ca. 1867–1944)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0522">2. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
