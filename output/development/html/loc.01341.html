      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman —
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Altho I am busy this evening, I must find time to send you word of how very, very
      much we enjoyed seeing Mr. Quincy Shaw's Millet pictures this morning. Your note I
      believe gained for Mr. Clifford
      permission to go and see them, and papa, Logan and I went with him. I hardly ever
      spent such a delightful morning, and the remembrance is almost as good as the
      reality was. And, best of all, Mr. Shaw invited Logan and myself to come over any time, and
      spend quiet, free hours among his beautiful collection. It added not a little to our
      pleasure this morning to be with a man who knew and loved the artist so well, and
      we
      all feel very grateful to you for the pleasure of the morning. Mr. Clifford showed
      us
      his sketch of you. We liked the cheery expression—but were not entirely satisfied
      with the picture.
   </p>
   
   <p>Logan and I will be home soon—for Thanks giving. Papa said "What shall we do to
      celebrate your vacation and make you have a good time"—"Pursuade Mr. Whitman to come
      over!" I said. Well, we certainly shall see you, even if the Daimon doesn't approve of
      your coming to Germantown—But I hope he will be in a complaisant mood!
   </p>
   
   <p>I had a letter from Mr. Costelloe (one of the Englishmen who came over with me to
      see
      you), and he asked me to tell you that he read the little book you gave him to the
      passengers on the steamer going home, and that both reader and audience enjoyed it
      sincerely, and were much enlivened and strengthened by the "wonderful faith and hope"
      that
      breathed through the poetry. You certainly <u>do</u> 'blow grit'
      into people!
   </p>
   
   <p>But I must not make my letter longer—I shall look forward to seeing you soon,
      and I hope you will be well.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
