   <p>Mainly the same subject continued—the printed slip is a horrible dislocation
      &amp; hate manufactured out by J M Scovel<sup><a href="#n1049" id="r2">2</a></sup> of a talk the

      days—made my breakfast on bread &amp; canteloupe—still have my supper at
      4½—no dinner—fair excretion business—out in wheel ch'r last
      evn'g—my grip has call'd in upon me again the last two or three days (probably
      the great change in the weather &amp; stoppage of sweating)—not yet so bad as
      formerly—bladder botheration—a sister of one of my war soldiers call'd
      yesterday—a nice smart old maid—my soldier still lives &amp;
      flourishes—in California—Anson Ryder<sup><a href="#n0534b" id="r6">6</a></sup>—I get
      word or calls or jogs or mementos f'm them (the war soldiers) occasionally—one

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n1049">2. James Matlock Scovel began to
      practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War he was in the New Jersey
      legislature, and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned actively for Horace
      Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S. Treasury during Chester
      Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home
      for Sunday breakfast, as he did on December 2 and 9, 1877 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a description of
      these breakfasts, see <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed.
      William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel,
      see George R. Prowell's <em>The History of Camden County, New
         Jersey</em> (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n3039">4. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
