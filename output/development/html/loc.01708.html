   <p>Perhaps it may hardly be necessary, but I feel to write you a line of caution about
      the
      Tennyson letter.<sup><a href="#loc.01708_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> I rely on your promise not to publish the
      letter, nor any thing equivalent to it. The fact of it, with Tennyson's complimentary
      message &amp; invitation, I have no objection to your printing &amp;, after what I have
      said, leave it to you to carry all that out. You might do well to put in about my
      intended
      appearance<sup><a href="#loc.01708_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> before the American Institute, at its 40th opening,
      Sept. 7th in New York, and that the curiosity of both my friends &amp; foes is extremely
      piqued, &amp;c &amp;c.—what the poem will be—how delivered—&amp;c
      &amp;c—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0494">1. Hiram J. Ramsdell (1839–1887) was a clerk in
      Washington; in a hospital notebook (Henry E. Huntington Library), Walt Whitman
      called him "chief clerk."Ramsdell was the Washington correspondent for the New
      York <em>Tribune</em> and the Cincinnati <em>Commercial</em>. On , Ramsdell
      reported the high praise that George Townsend, the journalist (1841–1914),
      accorded to Walt Whitman—"a stupendous genius," "the song of a God." On
      , he asked Walt Whitman to do
      whatever he could for Judge Milton Kelly, of Idaho, against whom charges had
      been brought by "a very bad man," Congressman Edward Dexter Holbrook
      (1836–1870), a Democrat from the Idaho Territory. Actually, on July 12,
      1867, Walt Whitman had submitted to the Attorney General a "Report on the <em>Charges</em> submitted by <em>Hon. E. D.
         Holbrook</em>, Del[egate] from Idaho Terr[itory], <em>against</em>
      <em>Hon. Milton Kelly</em>, Asso[ciate] Just[ice] Supreme Court of
      Idaho" (National Archives). To this forty-one page summary of the evidence, all
      in Walt Whitman's hand, there is appended a letter signed by attorney general
      Henry Stanbery (1803–1881) but written by Walt Whitman, dated July 20,
      1867: "The Conclusion in the preceding Report is hereby adopted by me, &amp;
      ordered to stand as the decision of this Office in the Case, so far as now
      presented." On July 22, 1867, Ramsdell apologized for his "aggressiveness."
      (Ramsdell's letters are in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.) Judge Kelly
      wrote to Walt Whitman on June(?) 21, 1867 (National Archives), and again on  (Yale). On November 15, 1875,
      Ramsdell, among others, petitioned Benjamin H. Bristow (1832–1896),
      Secretary of the Treasury, that Walt Whitman "be appointed to a position in the
      Treasury Department" (National Archives).<a href="#r1">[back]
