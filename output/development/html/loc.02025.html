      <br></br>Los Angeles, Cal.—
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Sept 6, 1887
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your postal just received,
      Glad you coment that Grace shall go
      on with the Calendar.—They have not
      yet returned from their summer trip to
      Alaska.—Expect them about the 15th &amp;
      shall see them soon after they arrive—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have not heard from William direct
      since he want to Bar Harbor, but have a
      letter from Nelly this morning in which
      she says that the new farm is very
      favorable.—Dr Kinnear says he is 
      improving and William himself, who is not
      at all disposed to be sanguine on that point,
      also says the same.—He says that he wishes
      he had been fortunate enough to fall into
      Dr Kinnear's hands at first.—This is
      
      
      
      very good news, and I know it will be very
      joyful tidings to you and all of William's
      friends—The summer months are 
      now over, and I can truly say that
      Los Angeles has the most perfect summer
      climate I have ever experienced—<u>If
         this is a specimen</u>—no one would ever
      want to go away from here to escape the
      heat, rather stay to enjoy the ideal summer
      weather. Imagine a place where in the
      shade you are always comfortable—delicious sea breezes, in which you can smell
      the salt air, blow every afternoon (the ocean 
      is only 18 miles away) and the superb nights
      with their glorious pageantry of stars give 
      you the most refreshing sleep—always under 
      a blanket—I think that when this climate
      is truly known, as many people will come here
      from the East in the summer time to escape
      the torrid heat, as will come in the winter
      to avoid the Arctic cold.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The markets here are now gorged
      
      
      
      with the most magnificent display of fruit
      you ever saw. The most attractive are
      perhaps the peaches, the plums and the grapes
      which excel any thing I have heretofore
      known both in size, beauty and lusciousness.
      The muscats (principal grape for raisins) the 
      Malagas, (also for raisins) both white. Then
      there are the Saint Peters, the Tokays and the
      Mission grape (used principally for wine)—the latter all purple—You can buy them
      at the fruit stands for 2 cents a pound—some
      times 6 lb for 10 cents.—Some of the clusters
      weigh <u>three pounds</u> and more. They are a sight
      delightful to the eye.—There are also plenty of
      figs in market.—But I do not take much 
      to them in their natural state. This is also the 
      country of the olive, the pomegranate and the Almond.
      Large quantities of English walnuts are also raised.
      In the winter or early Spring the oranges and 
      lemons are gathered.—So you see this will
      be eventually the great fruit raising part of the U.S.
      No ports, no thunderstorms, no cyclones—
      
      
      
      But I have given you enough of Southern
      California for one time.—Always
      delighted to hear from you.—Send me a postal
      card when you can, and a letter when you
      have leisure &amp; feel like writing to your
      old comrade who is as ever.—
