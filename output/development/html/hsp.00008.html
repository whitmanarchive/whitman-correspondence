      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Alden:<sup xmlns=""><a href="#hsp.00008_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>

   <p>Would the enclosed be considered opportune—&amp; of use to you for <em>The Citizen</em>? 
      As it has been printed before, it would <em>not</em> be proper to put 
      "For <em>The Citizen</em>" over it—but just print it plainly. Of course it is gratuitous—&amp; I accompany it with
      best respects to yourself. I have not forgotten 
      your kind invitations to furnish an original piece for the paper—&amp; hope one day to
      have something which will be suitable. 
      I am writing very little lately. Should you print the piece, 
      I wish you to do me the favor to send ten copies by mail to my address here.

      Whitman's  letter to William D.
      O'Connor. According to Rollo G. Silver, "A Broadway Pageant," which had been
      published in <em>Drum-Taps</em>, was reprinted on September 5,
      1868, in the <em>Citizen</em>; see Silver, "Thirty-One Letters of
