   <p>It is very pleasant &amp; sunny to-day &amp; I am going out in the rig abt 1 o'clock

      have dinner &amp; a good generous drink of the best champagne—I enjoy
      everything—Nothing new with me—there seems to be some hitch in the 
      Herald's publ'ng my little pieces<sup><a href="#n4133" id="r3">3</a></sup>—(I hear that
      they have been appealed to in print to stop such stuff)<sup><a href="#loc.07490_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I feel lately as if I
      sh'd make a start in putting <em>November Boughs</em><sup><a href="#n3999" id="r5">5</a></sup> in type making perhaps 150 to less than
      200 pp.—some 30 pp, perhaps, of poems to go afterward as <em>Annex</em> to L of G. My

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07490_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr R M Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: (?) | Apr
      8(?) | 5 PM | 88.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4146">2. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel (1856–1914), was
      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on his relationship with Whitman, see
      Thomas Biggs Harned, <em>Memoirs of Thomas B. Harned, Walt
         Whitman's Friend and Literary Executor</em>, ed. Peter Van Egmond (Hartford:
      Transcendental Books, 1972).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4133">3. In late 1887, James Gordon Bennett,
      Jr., editor of the <em>New York Herald</em>, invited Whitman to
      contribute a series of poems and prose pieces for the paper. From December 1887
      through August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems appeared.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07490_n2">4. On April 1, 1888, Whitman
      sent a bill for $40 to the <em>Herald</em> (Whitman's <em> Commonplace Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
      According to a note of  from Bennett there
      was a slight error in Whitman's bill. Bennett requested ten more poems for
      April.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">5. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6174">6. On March 24, 1888, Frederick W.
      Wilson informed William Sloane Kennedy, author of <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> (1896), that he was most interested in
      obtaining subscribers to the projected publication. On  Kennedy observed, "I have not much faith in the despatch of
      F. W. Wilson. . . . I have sent him 20 names." Wilson was a member of the
      Glasgow firm of Wilson &amp; McCormick that published the 1883 British edition
      of <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em>.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07490_n4">7. Rhys had written to Whitman
      from Boston on . For Whitman's
      commentary on the letter, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.9.html">Tuesday, January 29, 1889</a>. Rhys wrote again on ; for Whitman's thoughts on the
      letter, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.10.html">Tuesday, July, 24, 1888.</a>. At this time relations between Rhys and
      William Sloane Kennedy were strained; on  Kennedy had written to Whitman: "Rhys continues his schemes on
      society's pocket-book, &amp; demoralizes my nerves frightfully when I see him,
      somehow." Whitman observed to Traubel in May: "You couldn't get 'em to fit
      nohow. Kennedy will hardly fit anything but a chestnut burr" (Horace Traubel,
      <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.50.html">Thursday, May 17, 1888</a>; <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.100.html">Monday, October 2, 1888</a>.)<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0862">8. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3166">9. Thomas Eakins (1844–1919) was
      an American painter. His relationship with Whitman was characterized by deep
      mutual respect, and he soon became a close friend of the poet. For more on
      Eakins, see Philip W. Leon, "Eakins, Thomas (1844–1916)," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07490_n5">10. A New York lawyer, Thomas
      J. McKee, wrote to Whitman on : "I
      received your letter but had been looking into the matter for some days
      previously, Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke and Mr. Johnston having spoken to me about
      your claim against Worthington. The difficulty I find is this that R.
      Worthington failed some time since and is now unable to do business in his own
      name, and the business is now run by a corporation named the Worthington Co. of
      which Worthington's wife or some female relative is the President. The time
      within which to claim a forfeiture of the plates and books (two years) has run
      out and we are therefore limited to our action for an injunction and damages, I
      am therefore quietly trying to get all the facts I can as to what the
      'Worthington Co.' has been doing with reference to your book. The Company is of
      some responsibility and undoubtedly have possession of the plates. As soon as I
      have facts sufficient to base a sure claim I will get the injunction and money.
      See also Whitman to Richard Watson Gilder, , for an account of Whitman's dealings with Worthington.<a href="#r10">[back]

   <p id="n2002">11. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
