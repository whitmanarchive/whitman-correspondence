   <p>We had a terrible rainstorm here yesterday. Nearly as bad as our flood of 5 years
      ago
      this same month (July, 83). No great harm done however and this morning the air is
      clearer and brighter and fresher than ever. I got your card of 21st yesterday also
      a
      few more pp. of proofs<sup><a href="#loc.07216_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> (have the proofs now to p. 96). Surely you are a little on
      the mend—do you not think so? I do wish however you 
      wd
      
       mend a little faster—it is slow and dull work for you I fear. We are
      well here, Mrs. B.<sup><a href="#n4273" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp;c &amp;c still away (as I told you a few
      days ago) the little children at home very merry. All goes quietly at the Asylum.
      Not quite such hard work the last few days, am glad to have a little pause.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
