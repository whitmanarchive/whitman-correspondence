      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just received a letter from you<sup><a href="#owu.00002_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> and as I am rocking the baby<sup><a href="#owu.00002_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> I thought I would
      answer it but you will [
      <span class="unclear">have
         to take?</span>]
       it written with pencil I feel a little annoyed that Jeff
      should have written you about Jess although it was an aweful scene and I do not want
      to witness another for I must say I never was so frightened in my life I cannot
      write you the particulars it would take so long he commenced at Hattie because she
      pushed a chair it was not what she done for he wanted a chance all day to have a
      [
      <span class="unclear">muss?</span>]
       with
      some one he
      flew at Hattie uttering a terrible oath I protected her and told him to let her
      alone she had done no harm then he said 'I would not hurt the child no indeed but
      you D_ old B_ you have been picking at me all day and I will soon put an end to you
      he flew right  towards
      me he looked just like a madman and what he would have done if your mother had not
      interfered the Lord only knows I still thought I would not let him see I was 
      affraid
      
       and I told him he better try it if he dare to when he flew at me again and
      said he did not mean to hurt me but now he Be D_ if he would'nt knock my brains out
      such a D_ fool as I was hadn't right to live I managed to get out of the basement<sup><a href="#owu.00002_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      but it was a long time before I could get up stairs when Jeff came home I told him
      about it and he was very much excited and was going downstairs but I 
      beged
      
       of him to stay you know Dear Brother how Impulsive Jeff is but come to the
      point I dont think Jeff would do a rash act any quicker than I or you would he is
      
      naturrally
      
       so good and kind my back achued two or three days and it made Jeff very
      angry I do not have Jess up in my room any more he has not rocked the baby since
      that Friday<sup><a href="#owu.00002_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> he is very ugly and irritable he sleeps till late every afternoon Mother
      feels very bad that I wont have him up stairs because it deprives her the pleasure
      of
      spending most of her time with me and especially her evenings<sup><a href="#owu.00002_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> but  he has such ugly
      spells that I am affraid of him last week he got angry at Hattie twice and made
      terrible threats and this conduct is nothing new only he used to confine it to your
      mother I have often seen him take up a chair to throw at her but we must submit to
      it and try to bear with him I think sometimes it is very hard for mother to have so
      much trouble she feels it more now than ever before but I can never consent to have
      him in my room again I think Poor Dear Andrews death has shocked him very much<sup><a href="#owu.00002_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup> I
      think just as much of him now as I ever did but he has taken such a dislike to
      Hattie that I am 
      affraid
      
       to have him up stairs he sometimes says if he could be where there was no
      young ones he would get his senses but you must not think any thing of what Jeff
      said about shooting him for you must know he wouldn't do any thing of the kind
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well Dear Brother I dont know as there is any news to write about we are here about
      the same as when you left<sup><a href="#owu.00002_n8" id="r7">7</a></sup> only we miss Andrew coming around every day Jimmy has been
      very sick he has had the Gastric fever but is better now, when I think about Andrews
      family it makes  me
      feel very bad they are so utterly 
      distitute
      
       Mother sent them 50 cts last Thursday and afterwards I thought I would go 
      arround
      
       and see Jimmy I took him a chicken he said he thought he would get well
      now, he liked chicken I asked Nancy if she had things to eat she said yes I knew by
      her manner it was not so and come to question her she had nothing but a crust of
      bread I gave her a Dollar it was all the money I had and I sent her 
      arround
      
       a large basket of Provisions when Jeff came home I told him about it he
      went 
      arround
      
       to see Nancy intending to give her some money but Milgate<sup><a href="#owu.00002_n9" id="r8">8</a></sup> had just been
      there and gave her $30.00—he raffled off Andrews tools at 25 cts a chance
      it came in first rate and this morning Cornell<sup><a href="#owu.00002_n10" id="r9">9</a></sup> sent for Nancy and told her he would
      buy her a sewing Machine but she will never make out much as she is in the street
      most all day I feel very sorry for her her case is 
      aweful
      
       she is going to have another child<sup><a href="#owu.00002_n11" id="r10">10</a></sup> and it seems as if the creature cant do
      much but it seems as if the Lord always provides for the Widow and I feel confident
      that He will provide for her Mr Rodgers lost his wife very suddenly last week you
      know him he lives in this street and Jenny Ward<sup><a href="#owu.00002_n13" id="r11">11</a></sup> has lost her husband he died to his
      fathers went over there to see his doctor last Friday week and died the following
      Monday Jenny was here the night he died she said she expected him over the next day
      you know he has been sick a long time he was found dead in his chair. We are very
      
      lonesome here Jeff has gone away again he is now at Albany<sup><a href="#owu.00002_n14" id="r12">12</a></sup> I expect him home Friday
      Dear Brother I commenced this letter Monday and I am finishing it today Wednesday
      Mother has just received a letter from you and she said she could not put Jess in
      the Asylum that it would be time enough when she was dead that she could not stand
      it to see [
      <span class="unclear">him?</span>]
       go he
      does not seem any worse than he has been and untill matters get worse I dont think
      you could pursuade her to send him Well Dear Brother you see I am rather crowding
      things on this page and I shall have to stop I have been trying to plan some way to
      send you a mince pie I made 17 large [
      <span class="unclear">ones?</span>]
       and they are splendid
      if you could get a pass I think it would pay to come home and I will make you some
      [illegible] cakes just think about it I sometimes wonder if we
      will ever live together again and have George home going to work every day like he
      used to Wouldn't it be pleasant now I think I have told you all the news but I must
      not finish without saying something about my two little darlings Hattie is about as
      mischievous as ever a great deal of company for me now Jeff is away she is better
      than when you was home and little California I think is just about cunning enough
      she is
      fatter than ever and when I think about them both I flatter myself that I have got
      about the nicest prettiest little creatures that can be found any where. Now Dear
      Brother I will close and if you will write me again I will answer.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="owu.00002_n2">1. This letter is not
      known.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="owu.00002_n3">2. Jessie Louisa, who later
      in the letter is referred to as "California."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="owu.00002_n4">3. The basement of the
      house on Portland Avenue was the Whitmans' main, and "a little crampt," living
      space, much of the house being rented out to the John Brown family (see the
      letter from Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman of ). In spite of the close quarters, Walt Whitman, after
      moving to Washington, remembered the basement fondly: "if I could only be home
      two or three days &amp; have some good teas with you [Mrs. Whitman] &amp; Mat
      &amp; set in the old basement a while..." (<em>The
         Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–69], 1:210).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="owu.00002_n5">4. It had been his habit to
      rock the cradle for Mattie "day in and day out" (see the letter from Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman of ).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="owu.00002_n6">5. Mrs. Whitman's feelings
      about this prohibition differed markedly from Mattie's estimate of them: "you
      know they wont have Jess up stairs now so we have the benefit of the children
      down stairs i dont mind the baby but i really think hattie is the worst child i
      ever had any thing to doo with so very ugly with her mischiev[ing?]" (see the
      letter from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman of ).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="owu.00002_n7">6. Mrs. Whitman wrote in
      her letter to Walt of  that
      "seeing his brothers corps seemed to effect him very much."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="owu.00002_n8">7. Walt had left Brooklyn
      in mid-December, 1862 to find his brother George who had been reported wounded.
      After staying with George for two weeks in a camp near Falmouth, Virginia, he
      took up residence in Washington, working part-time in the army Paymaster's
      office (see Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New
      York: Macmillan, 1955], 282–86).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="owu.00002_n9">8. Milgate was one of the
      men who had worked with Andrew at the Brooklyn Navy Yard (see the letter from
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman of ).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="owu.00002_n10">9. Undoubtedly James H.
      Cornwell, Andrew's friend and frequent companion, after whom Andrew named his
      son James Cornwell Whitman—see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs: Comrades</em> (Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931), 82.
      Cornwell was probably the son of Justice James Cornwell, about whom Walt Whitman
      wrote a sketch, "Scenes in a Police Justice's Court Room," for the Brooklyn <em>Daily Times</em>. The sketch is reprinted in <em>The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Emory Holloway
      (New York: Peter Smith, 1932), 2:10–12. Mrs. Whitman's letters repeatedly
      refer to Andrew's friend and to the Justice as "Cornell," and Mattie apparently
      followed her in this error. For an extended discussion of James Cornwell's
      friendship with Andrew, see <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em>, ed. Jerome M. Loving (Durham, NC: Duke University
      Press, 1975), 165–67.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="owu.00002_n11">10. If we are to believe
      the worst of Mrs. Whitman's remark that Nancy "goes it yet in the street," (see
      the letter from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman of ) she had become a prostitute,
      perhaps even before Andrew's death; yet there is no reason to believe that
      Andrew was not the father of the son she bore the following spring, who was
      called Andrew Whitman. "Little Andrew" was run over and killed by a brewery
      wagon in September 1868, just a few months after Nancy had given birth to twins,
      one stillborn (Allen, 397–98; Loving, 13). See the letter from Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman of .<a href="#r10">[back]

      a friend of the Whitmans. Jeff wrote to Walt on  of the death of her husband James.<a href="#r11">[back]
