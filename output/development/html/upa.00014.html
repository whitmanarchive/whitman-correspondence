   <p>Your letter is 
      rec'd
      
      , having been sent on to me from Washington.<sup><a href="#upa.00014_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> My address
      still remains Solicitor's office, Treasury there. I am moving about a good deal the
      past
      year, &amp; shall be for the ensuing year—I am to start for northern New England,
      &amp; remain awhile<sup><a href="#upa.00014_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—am also arranging for a trip afterward
      to California—a journey I have had in contemplation for several years, &amp; which has
      been two or three times fixed, but postponed, during that time.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been stopping for two months, (Feb. &amp; March,) home with my Mother<sup><a href="#n0705" id="r4">4</a></sup>, &amp; am
      writing this home. Mother is towards eighty—has had an active domestic &amp; maternal
      life—has had eight children—has brought them all up—has been healthy &amp;
      strong, always worked hard—now shows the infirmities of age (indeed rapidly advancing)
      but looks finely, &amp; is cheerful hearted—will probably soon give up her
      housekeeping &amp; go to live with one of my brothers, who is married<sup><a href="#upa.00014_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup>—My father died seventeen years since.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear friend, I am quite sure that <em>every one</em> of your letters has
      safely reached me—sometimes after delays &amp; circuits, (as you will now understand
      better) on account of my more &amp; more frequent
      wanderings—The
      letter with the photographs gave me great pleasure—&amp; was acknowledged by a letter
      I sent you<sup><a href="#upa.00014_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup>—Have you not received it?

   <p>Dear friend, let me warn you somewhat about myself—&amp; yourself also. You must
      not construct such an unauthorized &amp; imaginary ideal Figure, &amp; call it W. W. and
      so devotedly invest your loving nature in it. The actual W. W. is a very plain personage,
      &amp; entirely unworthy such devotion.<sup><a href="#upa.00014_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup></p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0259">1. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

      College in June 1872, mentioned in Whitman's  letter to Peter Doyle.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0705">4. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="upa.00014_n4">6. Gilchrist sent the photographs on . Perhaps Whitman intended to
      acknowledge them in his  letter to
      Gilchrist.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00014_n5">7. On , Gilchrist objected to this warning: "it hurts so, as seeming to
      distrust my love. . . . O, I could not live if I did not believe that sooner or
      later you will not be able to help stretching out your arms towards me &amp;
      saying 'Come, my Darling.'" On ,
      Gilchrist begged for a longer letter, "for I sorely need it." Though she
      declared that she would be satisfied with a gossipy letter about his affairs,
      she really wanted more: "And if you say 'Read my books, &amp; be
      content—you have me in them'—I say, it is because I read them so
      that I am not content." Toward the conclusion of the letter she spoke of coming
      to America. On , she acknowledged his
      gift of <em>As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free</em> and wrote again
      of the effect of Whitman's poems on her: "Had I died the following year 1870, it
      would have been the simple truth to say I died of joy." Gilchrist wrote again on
      —Walt Whitman had been
      silent—"I must write not because I have anything to tell you—but
      because I want so, by help of a few loving words, to come into your presence as
      it were—into your remembrance."<a href="#r7">[back]
