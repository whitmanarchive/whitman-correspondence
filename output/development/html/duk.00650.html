      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter day before yesterday—&amp; am sorry you are troubled with
      rheumatism—it must be quite bad—Do you have any one to do the rougher
      house-work? I hope you have. Mother, every thing is pretty much the same with
      me—I remain very well, go around a good deal in the open air—we have it
      pretty hot in the middle of the day, &amp; dusty—but the nights are
      beautiful—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I know the Mr. Simonson<sup><a href="#duk.00650_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> you saw at the post office—he has been a sort of Deputy
      post master a good many years—Notwithstanding what he says, the Brooklyn p. o.
      has a very bad name, &amp; a great many money letters sent there never get to their
      destination—but I should think by what you have said, that the carrier who
      brings your letters must be a good safe man—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We had the strangest procession here last Tuesday night, about 3000 darkeys, old
      &amp; young, men &amp; women—I saw them all—they turned out in honor of
      <em>their</em> victory in electing the Mayor, Mr. Bowen<sup><a href="#duk.00650_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—the
      men were all armed with clubs or pistols—besides the procession in the street,
      there was a string went along the sidewalk in single file with bludgeons &amp;
      sticks, yelling &amp; gesticulating like madmen—it was quite comical, yet very
      disgusting &amp; alarming in some respects—They were very insolent, &amp;
      altogether it was a strange sight—they looked like so many wild brutes let
      loose—thousands of slaves from the Southern plantations have crowded up
      here—many are supported by the Gov't.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yesterday I went up to the Presidents to see the reception of the Chinese
      Embassy—there were eight or nine Chinese, headed by our Mr. Burlingame, who is
      head of them all, (O'Connor knows him quite well)—you will see the speech made
      to them by the President, in the papers—I think it is first rate<sup><a href="#duk.00650_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—

      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Sunday noon, June 7.
      
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am sitting awhile in the office—we are having a spell of hot oppressive
      weather—It is generally thought we clerks will get our extra
      compensation—but I wait to see whether Congress will pass it—if they do
      I will make you a present, mother dear—So you like the ticket, Grant &amp;
      Colfax,<sup><a href="#duk.00650_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> do you, mother? Well, I do, too—Chase<sup><a href="#duk.00650_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> is
      cutting up, trying to get somebody to nominate him, &amp; doing his best to injure
      the Republican ticket—He is just the meanest &amp; biggest kind of a
      shyster—He tried the same game at Lincoln's second nomination—Mother, I
      send the Chicago News, No. 7<sup><a href="#duk.00650_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—have you rec'd the six others all safe? I have
      sent them all—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p><em>Monday forenoon, June 8</em>. Nothing special to write about this
      morning, mother. We had a thunder-shower last night &amp; very pleasant this
      morning—I was up to O'Connors as usual last evening to tea—they are all
      well. Well, I believe that is all—only to send you my love, mother
      dear—same to George—write all the domestic news, &amp; about George's
      work, &amp; the house.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <p id="duk.00650_n2">2. Sayles J. Bowen, a
      Republican, was elected mayor on June 1, 1868, by 74 votes. He was the candidate
      of Col. J. W. Forney and the Washington <em>Chronicle</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00650_n3">3. The occasion for these
      ceremonies was the opening of trade and diplomatic relations with China. Anson
      Burlingame (1820–1870), U.S. Minister to China, was appointed by the
      Chinese government in 1868 "Envoy Extraordinary and High Minister
      Plenipotentiary," in which position he was to arrange treaties with the U.S. and
      other countries.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00650_n4">4. Ulysses S. Grant and

   <p id="duk.00650_n5">5. The New York <em>Times</em> of June 6, 1868, reported on "Mr. Chase and the
      Presidency—His Views of Party." At this time Salmon P. Chase was Chief
      Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. For Whitman's relations with Chase, see Ralph
      Waldo Emerson's  letter to

   <p id="duk.00650_n6">6. Whitman evidently began
      sending the Chicago <em>Weekly News</em> early in May, for on , Louisa Van Velsor Whitman noted:
      "Walter i like the chicago news very much. i never saw one before. i wish
      whenever you have one you would send it to me."<a href="#r6">[back]
