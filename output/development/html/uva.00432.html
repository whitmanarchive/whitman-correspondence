      <br></br>My Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am one of those ubiquitous autograph hunters and have written you several times
      asking the favor of your name, but so far have never received a reply from you. Now
      if you could take a [
      <span class="unclear">peep?</span>]
       into my album, which I have been over
      fifteen years in making, and see my fine collection of autograph notes from
      Tennyson down, I am sure you would be glad to add yours to
      the number.
   </p>
   
   <p>If you have made a rule never to reply to requests of this kind, please
      make an exception in my case and oblige,
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours obediently
      <br></br>[

   <p id="uva.00432_n1">1. The signature on this letter
      has been partially cut away. Whitman repurposed this letter, writing on the back
      notes that would become part of his lecture on the death of Abraham
      Lincoln.<a href="#r1">[back]
