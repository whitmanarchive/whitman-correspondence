   <p>Han<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r1">1</a></sup> has received all your letters, also the Radical, containing a very complimentary
      testimony by a genuine woman, to your "Leaves of Grass": Yet you perceive, even the
      praise she bestowes, [
      <span class="unclear">i?</span>]
      s
      qualified with the general recoil, which all natures of true human sensibility
      experience, at your (mistaken) barbarism. The louse and the maggot know as much
      about procreation as you do, and when you unveil and denude yourself you descend to
      the level of the dog, with the bitch, merely. But I intended to write of  Han only. She is
      tolerably well. The swelling in her neck has subsided. She makes a half barbarous
      life for herself, however and 
      allmost
      
       baffles all my efforts at times to humanize her. I have come to view her
      as a being, half child, wtih small promptings to her social obligations and no
      longer held her accountable for her ways. 
      Somethings
      
       she does very well, but her speech is so vagrant, that, to use her own
      expression, "I must not put any meaning in her words."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Her usual supiness, or sluggishness continues. I think it must be in the blood. It
      is
      very trying to me. Respecting her neglect in not writing to her mother, it is simply
      the want of inclination, but she treats her good, kind 
      neighbours
      
      , who came and watched over her, during  her last 
      dreadfull
      
       sickness the same way. On her recovery she never crossed the street to
      thank them. I need scarcely explain to you what gratitude is: Han could have done
      better and saved me great mortification, but her mother in Brooklyn, thwarted my 
      endeavours
      
      , by 
      continualy
      
       rushing in, and without sufficient occasion, advising separation. Oh! such
      stupid recklessness and wickedness. The 
      Allmighty
      
      , it seems to me, has no gift, in the Future [
      <span class="unclear">t?</span>]
      o amend the unnecessary and degrading
      experience [
      <span class="unclear">I?</span>]
       have endured.
      Nor would [
      <span class="unclear">I?</span>]
       enter upon
      such a life again, after it, were a thousand years of mortal existence promised to
      me, [
      <span class="unclear">(to?</span>]
       follow) every year
      to enter upon a different phase of life, each growing brighter and happier than the
      last, [
      <span class="unclear">s?</span>]
      till ascending upon
      a [
      <span class="unclear">g?</span>]
      reater scale of
      grandeur  and
      felicity.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But Han is to remain as she is and where she is. It is imperative: Any positive
      pressure 
      socialy
      
      , or change might prove disastrous. She is looking well, but is never
      feeling well—has headaches or something. She treats herself too barbarously
      entirely.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mrs Whitman<sup><a href="#n0705" id="r2">2</a></sup> rather intimates a desire to make Han another visit: She is becoming too
      aged, and it is as much as Han can do to take care of herself. For my part I have
      as
      much care as I desire, and more than I ever anticipated. I have just paid off the
      mortgage on my house and have sustained myse[
      <span class="unclear">lf?</span>]
       here, not so much upon the merit or appreciation of my
      paintings, as by a certai[
      <span class="unclear">n?</span>]
      
      force of character, which has found sympathy among the people.

   <p id="n0705">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
