      <br></br><br></br>My dear W.W.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your good letter (so kind of you to remember me in <u>my</u> loneliness of grim work) 
      rec'd
      
       this Eve.<sup><a href="#loc.02961_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Mrs K.<sup><a href="#loc.02897_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> is in Boston at a Symphony Concert
      and a precious ½ hour for my soul being at my disposal I feel a strong inner
      impulse to pour out here in the evening solitude, my heart to you in a genuine
      heart-letter of affection, welling up out of the of the deeps you long ago touched
      as no other ever did or can. Dear friend whom I have for so long admired, do you not
      feel that all is well with you &amp; the great cause of freedom for which you have
      laid down 
      yr 
      
       life? I do. I feel somehow that the future is going to be with you, with
      us. Humanity is sweeping on into the larger light. To we who have drank at all
      fountains of literature, the world over, &amp; climbed the lonely peaks of thought
      in every land &amp; age, your <u>Leaves of Grass</u> still towers
      up above everything else in grand aspiration, right philosophy, &amp; the heart
      beats of true liberty. Hugo<sup><a href="#n4276" id="r3">3</a></sup> does not satisfy, he saddens &amp;
      depresses me. He is a giant of despair, the limner of <u>scélerats</u> (rascals &amp; beggars chiefly)
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>You are very kind to offer to send me the new big vol.<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r4">4</a></sup> I shall prize it highly. I hope you
      will pardon the brevity &amp; inadequacy of my notice of "Nov. B."<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r5">5</a></sup> in <u>Transcript</u>. I am really ill with hard work—nerves
      trembling, eye fluttering &amp; above all sleepy. The rush of Holiday printing will
      be over in a month I hope, &amp; then I shall be able to breathe again. We are
      rolling out 90–100 books at once, &amp; <u>every page</u>
      must pass under my eye twice &amp; receive my <u>fecit</u> before it goes
      out,—my guarantee.
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r6">6</a></sup> writes me that I had better come &amp; raise fruit,—buy land
      adjoining him. <u>Perhaps I may</u> some time.
   </p>
   
   <p>How I wish you were going to live 50 
      yrs
      
       more. You may hold out 25 
      yrs
      
       yet, I   
      shldn't
      
       wonder. Live &amp; make us happy, noble friend. You are the only great
      literatus left alive in the world just at present. We can't spare you. The Infinite
      must wait.
   </p> 
   
   <p>I must stop &amp; copy a page or so (my daily stint) of my Whitman bibliography
      (sawdusty job rather, but of some little use I hope). Wife is well as can be &amp;
      we are cheery &amp; busy. Regards to all friends.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      on June 17, 1883. The couple's son Mortimer died in infancy.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n4276">3. Victor Hugo (1802–1885) was a
      French poet, novelist, and dramatist best known for <em>Les
         Miserables</em> (1862) and <em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em>
      (1833). For more on Hugo, see Victor Brombert, <em>Victor Hugo and
         the Visionary Novel</em> (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press,
      1984).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">4. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">5. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">6. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n5001">7. As yet we have no information about
      this person.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6000">8. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0862">9. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.<a href="#r9">[back]
