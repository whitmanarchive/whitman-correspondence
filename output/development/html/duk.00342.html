      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>My last letter home, was written from Lancaster and dated somewhere about the 16th
      or 18th of May. Since then we have been on the move again, as you see by the heading
      of this.<sup><a href="#duk.00342_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup> We left Lancaster on the morning of the 23d,<sup><a href="#duk.00342_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>marched about 11 miles and bivouaced at a place called Crab Orchard and stopped untill the morning of the 25th when we came on about 10 miles further and bivouaced near the Villiage of Stamford. Next morning we started on again and after a march of 10 miles more
      we arrived and pitched our camp at this place. We have a first rate camping ground,
      in a grove just outside this town, and are takeing things very comfortable. Our Regt.
      is the only troops here, the rest of our Brigade<sup><a href="#duk.00342_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> being at Stamford. Of course we dont know how long we shall stay here, or which way we will move next, &nbsp;We do picket duty
      on the roads, about the country here, and our chief business is, to look out for rebel
      Cavelry raids, as they have been in the habit of dashing through these small country towns,
      stealing horses and Cattle and everything else they wanted. We had quite an excitement
      the first night after our arrival here. We put up our tents, on the afternoon of our arrival, and I was promising myself a good nights
      sleep (as we were all pretty tired after our march, and the work of pitching camp)
      but about 9 O clock at night we were ordered to strike tents immediately, so we had
      to turn out and take down and load tents, pack trunks, and get ready for a move, which
      we did at short notice. As soon as the things were all loaded, I enquired around to
      try and find out what the fuss was all about, and when I did find out I felt mad enough
      I can tell you. It seems that somebody had passed our pickets, who said he was carrying
      dispatches, to somebody, who was stationed somewhere, and that the dispatches were
      from General Carter,<sup><a href="#duk.00342_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>and that the rebs had crossed the Cumberland River, and were in strong force, at a
      place called Liberty about 10 miles from here, and were comeing on this way. As soon as I heard the yarn I said it was a devilish foolish hoax, as
      I was satisfied that the enemy could never get as far in the State, as Liberty, without
      our hearing of it. and I dident like the idea of loseing my nights sleep for nothing. The wagon train started off towards the rest of our
      Brigade, and we fell in and marched about ½ a mile, and halted and stayed in the road
      all night. Next morning we came back here, and encamped again.

   <p>Mother I have not heard from you in quite a long time, &nbsp;I had a letter from Walt a
      few days ago, &nbsp;he said that all at home, was going on the same as usual. Andrew he
      thought would go to Newbern with Cornell<sup><a href="#duk.00342_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> &nbsp;Mary I hear has been down and paid you a visit, &nbsp;Walt says, probaly, Mary will go on to Burlington for Hannah, and bring her home. Mother, how are you
      getting along, &nbsp;does the rheumatism bother you much now. Mattie, and Sis, Walt says
      are first rate, &nbsp;Jess, and Ed, I suppose can take their rations regular. Jeff wrote
      to me three or four weeks ago, &nbsp;he says that as long as I dont hear from home I may know that all is right. That wont do Jeff, &nbsp;its a pretty good
      way to get off, but I dont see it.
   </p>
   
   <p>The news from Grant, down at Vicksburg is very encouraging,<sup><a href="#duk.00342_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &nbsp;I only hope it wont turn out like the news of the capture of Richmond. If it should
      turn out, that Vicksburg is certain to fall into our hands in this campaign it will
      be a heavy blow to the rebs.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just got Jeffs letter of the 22d. Mother I am very sory to hear that you are again troubled with rheumatism, &nbsp;I hope you wont attempt to
      work untill you get well, &nbsp;how about the vapor baths &nbsp;do you take them now, but I hope you are
      better by this time. Andrew to &nbsp;Jeff says &nbsp;is quite bad &nbsp;I hope he will take good care of himself, and soon get well, &nbsp;All the rest I am glad
      to hear are getting along first rate and are in good health, I hope, &nbsp;as Han (according
      to Heydes letter) has commenced to get well she will soon be able to come home, &nbsp;Take
      good care of yourself dear Mother, and let me hear from you often,
   </p>

      Much love to Mattie, and Sis, and all the rest,
