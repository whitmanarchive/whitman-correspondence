   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John White Alexander
      (1856-1915) was an American painter and illustrator, well known for his
      portraits of famous Americans including Oliver Wendell Holmes and John
      Burroughs, as well as Whitman, whose portrait he worked on from
      1886–1889.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pru.00001_n1">1. For three days beginning
      on Monday, February 22, Whitman sat for a portrait by Alexander. On April 17,
      1891, Alexander informed Whitman that one of the poet's admirers had purchased
      and presented the painting to the Metropolitan Museum of Art: "I am delighted to
      have been the means of giving to future generations a portrait of you that is
      certainly one of my best works" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). Burroughs, however, termed the portrait "a Bostonese
      Whitman—an emasculated Whitman—failing to show his power and
      ruggedness" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
      261). Whitman himself was not impressed (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, 9 vols. [1906–1996], 1:132, 284).<a href="#r1">[back]
