   <p>My best thanks to you, my dear, good old friend for your most welcome p.c. of Dec.
      23rd<sup><a href="#loc.02457_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> from which I was more than glad to learn that
      you were then in impr[illegible] health. I have also received [illegible] good letter from Horace Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      (written on Xmas day) in which he says that Christmas Eve found you in notably good
      trim &amp; relieved from many of your discomforts of the past few months. This is
      indeed good news for me, for Mr Wallace<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; for all your
      friends here who join me most heartily in congratulating you upon the improvement
      &amp; in the earnest hope that it may continue
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have given [illegible]</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>kind message &amp; they send you their love &amp; best wishes.</p>
   
   
   <p>Mr. Wallace has kindly sent me a copy of your p.c. to him.<sup><a href="#loc.02457_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> Thanks to you, too, for your kindness in sending the book to F.W.<sup><a href="#loc.02457_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> I have not yet seen him.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have had two magnificent days here, [
      <span class="unclear">thin?</span>]
       frost, bright sun shine, blue skies, a slight fall of
      snow last night following a really fine sunset; luminous starlight nights. I have
      been longing for a vigorous tramp over the hills &amp; fells, to taste the "caller
      air"<sup><a href="#loc.02457_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; to enjoy the rural delights I love so
      well. But alas! I am chained to the town by inexorable duty—which <u>you</u> help me to do more than I can tell you—and sick
      folks are numerous at this time of the year. But my work has its compensations [illegible]obably, nay, certainly, heightens my
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>enjoyment &amp; appreciation of the beauty, the mystery &amp; somewhat of the meaning
      of the shards of External Nature which <u>you</u> have opened my
      eyes to see.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yesterday afternoon I had a walk through our Bolton Park where, save for the flute
      like notes of a solitary blackbird and the cheery chirrups of a few sparrows, an
      ominous silence prevailed in the blackened leafless trees; &amp; I fear that the six
      weeks' frost &amp; snow have been fatal to a great many of our woodland
      songsters.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This afternoon I had an hour's skating &amp; very 
      exhilirating
      
       was it to glide over the ice upon which the setting sun was gleaming,
      &amp; reddening the faces of the skaters.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jany 7th</p>
   
   
   <p>This morning there was a dense fog &amp; Jack Frost had ornamented our windows with
      his inimitably beautiful pr[illegible]
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>&amp; hung our hedges &amp; trees with his white rime, transforming them into silver
      filagree work. The afternoon was beautifully fine &amp; sunny &amp; this evening the
      children's party I mentioned in a previous letter comes off. About 50 prettily
      dressed little boys &amp; girls have just had "high tea", to which they have done
      ample justice, &amp; the general jollification &amp; juvenile revelry are now at
      their height. There are games, romps, dances, bon bons, crackers, Magic Lanterns,
      &amp; mirthful fun of all sorts in which I have been participating &amp; what is
      better, <u>enjoying</u> as much as the youngest of them.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Oh that <u>you</u> could come &amp; join our merry throng, as "the
      Carpenter" came to old Elkanah Dyzer's place<sup><a href="#loc.02457_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup> &amp; see the gladsome "gales of glee"
      that sweep around that room.
      [illegible] hear there echoing peals of laughter
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>&amp; see the joyous faces of those happy hearted children from whom I have just
      escaped in order to finish this letter to you as the mail goes tonight.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>With kindest regards to all the members of your household &amp; with best heart love
      to yourself

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
