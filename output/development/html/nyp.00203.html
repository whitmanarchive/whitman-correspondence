      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I ordered the draft to be paid to you, of course. All you have to do is to go down
      &amp; present it—they may ask you who you expected money from, &amp; where.
   </p>
   
   <p>I dont know, but I expect Jeff<sup><a href="#nyp.00203_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> or Mat<sup><a href="#nyp.00203_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> would do just as well.
   </p>

      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Mr. Lincoln,<sup><a href="#nyp.00203_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> the post master, knows about the letters &amp; money being stolen—the Post office here
      has conferred with him on the subject.
