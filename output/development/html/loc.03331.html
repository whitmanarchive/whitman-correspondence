      Your card of 24th Dec. came two days ago, not a little
      to my relief. I was beginning to fear lest you were
      not so well again. This year ought to treat you well, 
      &amp; give you the wind &amp; weather &amp; everything that you love,
      seeing that in it you attain three score &amp; ten. If good
      wishes of friends were of any direct use, physically, I
      mean, as well as in other ways, it would be the happiest
      year of your life. It seems very right &amp; fit that in it
      you should publish the <u>Édition Définitive</u> in this vol. of
      your "Complete Works,"<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r2">2</a></sup> which we all so eagerly expect.
      
   </p>

      The last few weeks have brought nothing perhaps that
      is very remarkable on the surface here. I have been
      jogging along quietly enough, but absorbing always a
      great deal humanly from the endlessly wonderful life
      of this great London. One of the most striking episodes
      I have lately had any share in was the Midnight Meeting
      of the unemployed of London on Christmas Eve. It
      was held at the foot of Cleopatra's Needle, round the base
      of which the various speakers were grouped, faced by the
      
      
      
      motley throng of men, who cheered hoarsely with
      hungry throats as the speechifying went on. Through the
      day it had been wet &amp; foggy in turn, but now the sky
      was of an American clearness, the half-moon shining
      bright behind the shaft of Cleopatra's Needle, contrasting
      strangely with the red torches held to light the orators.
      All together an impressive scene; &amp; when the Christmas Bells
      rang out, and one of the speakers called out —"Peace on
      Earth, Goodwill towards Men! If Jesus were in London
      to-day, would he be in those churches?"—and the
      crowd shouted back, <u>"No! he'd be here!—here with
         us!"</u>—the effect was dramatic in the extreme.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      When I had been standing in the crowd for some time,
      I discovered Jo. Pennell,<sup><a href="#n4322" id="r3">3</a></sup> the artist, standing near me
      and we presently went home together. He lives in the next
      street to Cowley St. from which by the way I may have to
      move shortly as my sister Edith (whom you know) is coming
      up to town to study music at the Academy.

      I am writing this at the Reading Room of British Museum,
      &amp; must end it rather hurriedly having to run
      off to meet my brother Percy (who is an actor) at
      Euston Station. Don't let me forget to tell you that
      that [sic] last night I saw Edward Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r4">4</a></sup>—first time
      these three years—at a meeting of Fabian Socy., where
      he lectures. He looks older than he did, —more nervous
      lines in his face. As he is staying in town we shall probably
      meet again.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4151">2. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n4322">3. Joseph Pennell (1857–1926)
      was an American lithographer, illustrator, and etcher whose work often depicted
      historic buildings and landmarks in Philadelphia and New York. Following his
      education in Philadelphia, he recolacted to London, where he taught at the Slade
      School of Fine Art.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0141b">4. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
