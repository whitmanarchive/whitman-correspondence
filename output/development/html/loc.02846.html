   <p>Glad to hear from you—as by your card of 17th just rec'd. Very glad to hear of S[ula]
      having got home 
      "well &amp; hearty"—Sheets you speak of, not yet come to hand.

   <p>I am better this winter, <em>seems almost decidedly</em>—banged bad enough yet, but the bad deathly spells 
      are very rare, (almost unknown) the last three months—I want to go to N Y city in
      January—to J H 
      Johnstons (in 10th street)—his jewelry store is at 150 Bowery, cor Broome—call &amp; see
      him—quite a 
      lull in my book selling, &amp; in my affairs, &amp; literary doings, generally—
   </p>
