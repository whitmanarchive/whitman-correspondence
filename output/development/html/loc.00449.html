      <br></br>St. Louis,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">August 23rd 1868
      
      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Having a half hour to spare I thought I could not better employ it than in writing
      you—We are getting along pretty well—Mattie has gained a great deal in the last week—although
      to-day she is not as well as she was a day or two ago yet she can go around without
      a cane—and without limping much—Hattie and Jessie are well as can be—Jessie is getting
      fat again—and Hattie looks remarkably well—indeed I think St Louis agrees with her
      if it dont with the rest of us<sup><a href="#loc.00449_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mat has got a pretty good girl now<sup><a href="#loc.00449_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—not the best—but good as they run—as soon as she can get around though and see to
      things herself I suppose matters will go better
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you see or read anything about a toy called "Planchett" &nbsp;There is an article in
      "Lippencotts" Mag for August on it<sup><a href="#loc.00449_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Davis<sup><a href="#loc.00449_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> bought one a few days ago and we tried it but it woul'd[nt] go for us at all—Yesterday a little daughter of a neighbor came in and Mattie and
      she tried it and it commenced to write answers to all questions like the devil—The
      thing is a little piece of black walnut abt 7" by 8"—heart shaped and abt ¼" thick <br><br><img class="teiFigure" src="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/figures/loc.00449.001.jpg"><br><br>with two little wheels and a hole in front in which you stick a pencil.<br><br><img class="teiFigure" src="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/figures/loc.00449.002.jpg"><br><br> &nbsp;—you lay a sheet of paper on a table and set this thing on it and then sit down
      and put the tips of your fingers on the top of the wood—in a few minutes the wheels
      begin to roll and the pencil to mark on the paper—then you ask questions and the "toy"
      will write answers &nbsp;I went home last evening and found that they were all in a high
      state of excitement from the fact that they (Mat and this little girl) had got it
      going and lots of questions answered—Mat asked it if you would come out and see us
      this fall and it wrote "Doubtful" (it makes a flourish like this at the end of every
      sentence)<sup><a href="#loc.00449_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> &nbsp;To a question of who would be next President it wrote "Grant"—then they asked it
      why Grant would be President and it wrote "Because"—lots of other questions were answered
      in the same way—you would laugh to see the excitement and expectancy when an answer's
      abt half written
   </p>
   
   <p>I had a letter from McNamee<sup><a href="#loc.00449_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> a few days ago—he told me that George had been sent down to Florence<sup><a href="#loc.00449_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> for a short time—has he returned yet—I was glad that the draft came all right—and
      by the way is that car stable yet on the lots opposite my lot in Flatbush avenue—tell
      George to look when he goes in that neighborhood &nbsp;If they should clear that out I
      dont know but what it would be a good idea to build on that lot one of these days
   </p>
   
   <p>Mat will write you soon—everything is going abt the same as usual with us—I dont ever hear from Walt—I suppose he is well however—has he been home lately—Love to
      George Ed and all—write when you can—affectionately
   </p>

   <p id="loc.00449_n1">1. Interestingly, the
      water of St. Louis bothered the Jefferson Whitmans. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      reported to Walt Whitman that "the water dont agree with them &nbsp;in the morning
      when they first get up they often all vomit at once" (February 12, 1868 [Trent
      Collection, William R. Perkins Library, Duke University]).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00449_n2">2. Mattie had already
      informed Louisa Van Velsor Whitman on August 4 that she had to discharge her
      "darkey": "she got so lazy she was worse then nobody. last thursday I got
      another girl (a white one this time)" (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1977], p. 56).<a href="#r2">[back]

      Jeff accurately describes the appearance and operation of this early psychic
      instrument, which was invented about 1855 and later used without a pencil as the
      pointer on the ouija board. Jeff's two sketches are reproduced about
      full-size.<a href="#r3">[back]

      where George went to inspect iron pipes at the R. D. Woods foundry. In November
      1868 he became pipe inspector at a foundry in Camden, New Jersey (Gay Wilson
