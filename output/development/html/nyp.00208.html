      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter of last Thursday—I suppose you got one from me the Saturday before,
      with some envelopes in, &amp; $1—Well, mother, you have got a letter from that good for
      nothing pup again<sup><a href="#nyp.00208_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—it is too bad to be worried so—but one is powerless to do any thing, under present
      circumstances—I hope George will do well, in the houses, if he &amp; the others put them
      up on Portland av.—I see there are cases of cholera once in a while in New York—you
      must all be careful of yourselves—it is very healthy here this summer—I havn't been troubled by the heat yet—my head is much better—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I must tell you I am having some new shirts made—quite an event—I can't hardly
      believe it when I think how those old ones you fixed, &amp; fixed again, have held out—but,
      poor old things, they have got played out pretty well—why I believe I have got one
      or two that you fixed for me when I went to Boston there six years ago, &amp; more—I have
      'em made in the same way as ever, &amp; I think they are going to be very good—I expect
      to have half a dozen—so you see I am coming out—had quite a clearing out the other
      day, collected all my old tattered duds &amp; socks, &amp; boots &amp; slippers &amp;c &amp;c. into a
      great heap—and when Sally, our black girl, brought up my breakfast, I told her she
      could have 'em all, if she wanted 'em—she was most tickled to death—took 'em all off
      home—there was nothing but what was all give out, though—
   </p>
   
   <p>There is nothing new with me in my affairs—if things would only work so that I could
      get a higher grade, with more pay, it would come very acceptable—but here I remain,
      in the same way as at first—however I am very glad to have what I have—Tell Jeff<sup><a href="#nyp.00208_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I should like to see him very much—I think he would find it pleasant to come here
      for a few days, even this season—Well, dear mother, my sheet is full—love to all—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00208_n1">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      informed Walt on June 7, 1866, that she had sent "a short note to the honorable
      mr Heyde as i received a veery lengthy epistle from him the other day. i really
      think the world never produced such another man or devil. i think he is nearest
      the last named. i wrote very short with no compliment that i was not surprised
      at his wishing to get rid of han, that he had expressed that wish many times
      before this letter" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare
      Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). In a letter to Whitman in
      , Heyde had accused Mrs. Whitman of
      fomenting trouble between him and his wife.
