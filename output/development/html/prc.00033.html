   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The editor of the <em>Critic</em> in this year was Jeannette Gilder (1849–1916), who wrote
      that "one of the things of which I am most proud is that the <em>Critic</em> was the first publication of its class to invite Walt Whitman
      to contribute to its pages" (see Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt
         Whitman as Man, Poet, and Friend</em> [1915], 97); she was assisted in her
      editorial tasks by her brother Joseph. For more, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_94.html">Gilder, Jeannette L. (1849–1916)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
