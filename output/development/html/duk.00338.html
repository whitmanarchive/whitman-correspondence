      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have, to night, received a letter from Walt, encloseing two from Jeff (one dated Feb 3d and the other Feb 4th) and the one from Hannah, that
      Jeff sent him. Dear Mother how sorry I am to hear that you, and Mattie, and Sis, are
      not well, but as Jeff says in his last letter that you are all much better than you
      were the day before, &nbsp;I do hope you have entirely recovered by this time. Mother I
      think you ought to be a great deal more careful of yourself, you know how much you
      have suffered from colds, and rheumatism and how long any thing of that kind hangs
      on to you, and Mammy you must remember that you cant expect to work and do as you
      used to, so I think you ought to let up, a little on yourself.
   </p>
   
   <p>Poor Han, I was so in hopes that she was home by this time. I am sure she must have
      seen a great deal harder times than ever I did, and I have more reason to feel anxious
      about her than she has about me. Still I hope she will soon be with you and then I
      feel satisfied she will soon be well, &nbsp;She tries to make us think that she gets along
      pretty well, but I can see by her letter that she is not as comfortable as she would
      make us believe. Mother I know you will all do everything you can for her, but dont you think it would be well for Walt to go on there and see her, even if she did not
      feel well enough to come on home with him. But Mother I leave it altogather with you, at home, for I know, that you know what to do, better than I can tell you,
      and all I can say is do whatever you think best.
   </p>
   
   <p>We have been under marching orders for the last 48 hours, and I have it from pretty
      good authority that our Army Corps are ordered to report to General Dix,<sup><a href="#duk.00338_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> at Fortress Monroe. What we are to do there I dont know But I have an opinion that Burnside is going to have a sepperate command<sup><a href="#duk.00338_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and that Fortress Monroe is to be the place of rendezvous, and if my opinion is correct
      we will probaly stay there some time. There was an order issued, from Head Quarters; a few days since,
      allowing two Officers (at one time) from each Regt. a leave of absence of 10 days. Capts Sims<sup><a href="#duk.00338_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> and Wright<sup><a href="#duk.00338_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> (from this Regt) are home now, and when they get back I believe it is my turn, so
      if this movement of ours dont knock the thing in the head (and I dont know how it will be) you may expect to see me home for a short time, before many
      days. I wrote Walt a few days ago, to write to you and have you send him by express
      $20 and for him to bring it down here to me. If we go to Fortress Monroe it will be
      almost as handy for him to come and see me as it is here, and if I can get a chance
      to come home I shall want the money to pay my way. I had my log house almost finished,
      when the orders came for us to get ready to move, and was going to have a nice warm
      house. but I am bound to have some good out of it and so I am useing it for fire wood.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good night Dear Mother, much love to all,</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Lincoln had removed Burnside and put General Joseph Hooker (1814–1879) in

   <p id="duk.00338_n3">3. Samuel H. Sims, a captain
      in George Whitman's Fifty-first New York Volunteer Regiment, had been the
      subject in part of Walt Whitman's article, "Our Brooklyn Boys in the War," which
      appeared in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, on January 5, 1863.
      Sims died on July 30, 1864, of wounds received near Petersburg, Virginia (see
      George Washington Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from ). Walt Whitman may have lived in
      Sims's tent during part of his stay at Falmouth, Virginia, opposite
      Fredericksburg—a trip that Walt took in search of George after reading his
      brother's name in the <em>New York Herald</em> listed among the
      wounded in the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862. As it turned out,
      George only suffered a minor injury; George wrote in a letter to his mother on
      : "I have come out safe and
      sound, although I had the side of my jaw slightly scraped with a peice of shell
      which burst at my feet."<a href="#r3">[back]
