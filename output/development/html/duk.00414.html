   <p>Your letter to Han<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r2">2</a></sup>, with 1 dollar—received. She is very nervous: did not sleep
      all night. I have a roost in noreast corner—small room, enough but brightens
      with early morning light. 4 or 5 oclock—
   </p>
   
   <p>I get solitary breakfast—best I can—always did—dont mind it, if I can be helpd
      [illegible] little at times—sell paintings, trifle over cost
      of framing—go with poor clothing—very seedy—dont mind that can I
      but keep square on provisions—no let bill double on
      me—You have great 
       
      enthusaism
      
       to aid and help you perhaps with money—no such sentiment here. I
      painted Vermont State Coat of Arms 26 years ago—no Executive Seal—get 50
      dollars for it—This is sculptured on the Gettysburg Monument, and the Army
      Associations—Got all thi[

       acknowledged by G.G. Benedict's in daily Journall,

   <p>No State pride—Edmunds<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r3">3</a></sup> and I, Stewart<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r4">4</a></sup>—complain of poverty miserable
      people—yet grand country in scenery—speak to George<sup><a href="#n0700" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I must keep
      the house and maintain it—Han must have a home—she [
      <span class="unclear">cant?</span>]
       survive a sale
      or removal—I wrote to George before Christmas advising him to send
      money—This box amounts to nothing—
      better had sent the dollar it cost to forward it—Han has used some thread out
      of it—the handsome bed spread, was examined, then thrust back in the box, and
      pushed under a table—getting dusty and musty—I have not a comfortable bed
      for years—yet I can sleep, after [
      <span class="unclear">and?</span>]
       can crowd in a form, and draw covering over me—warm
      with an old overcoat and cotton coverlid—I have a blanket now—I don't
      require it—I never undressed coldest
      nights last winter—tired oft as an old [
      <span class="unclear">vetrans?</span>]

      tracks, [illegible] and slept, after a hard day battle with
      life—O! oh! what an experience—
      narative  
      
      .
   </p>
   
   <p>Got a heater last winter, gave a picture for it—pipe passed into chimney
      through my room 
      mad

   <p>My sister on Staten Island has been dangerously ill for some weeks—now
      convalescing—a frail looking creature, and yet the

      guiless
      
      —beloved——I have not seen either of my Sisters in 35
      years. I have numerous choice painting [illegible] reserve for an
      appreciative customer perhaps—Five it is said—God, it is hard—

   <p id="n0700">5. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
