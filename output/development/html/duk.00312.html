   </p> 
   
   <p>Mattie arrived all right on Wednesday abt 3<u>ocl</u><sup><a href="#duk.00312_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—in the afternoon—We were all glad enough to see her I assur you—The weather had been very bad ever since she left Brooklyn—but she got along
      very comfortably—and looked very well when she got in—I should have written you yesterday—but
      I understoo[d] Mat to say that she either would or had done so
   </p>
   
   <p>Mat had a fine visit home and I think it has done her lots of good—also I am very
      glad to hear that there is a prospect of getting you and Walt out here<sup><a href="#duk.00312_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—hope you will come sure—
   </p>
   
   <p>Please excuse this letter as I have just time to say that Mat arrived safely—the children
      are well and happy as can be—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00312_n1">1. Leaving her
      daughters with a housekeeper and Jeff's colleague Davis, Mattie travelled to
      Brooklyn in mid-February 1870. Jeff accompanied her as far as Pittsburgh where
      he stopped for business before joining her in Brooklyn. After a few days Jeff
      returned to St. Louis but Mattie remained in Brooklyn until mid-March (<em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em>, ed.
      Randall H. Waldron [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 68).<a href="#r1">[back]

      were not acted upon (Waldron, 70).<a href="#r2">[back]
