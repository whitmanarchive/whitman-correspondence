      <br></br><br></br>Mr. Whitman
      <br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your letter some three weeks ago, but have not had much chance to answer
      it until now. I am alone at home, with my brothers—Papa &amp; Mother are gone visiting
      to Uncle John's Father's-in-law.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Garrie and I have been to school to day—the teacher was pretty cross.</p> 
   
   <p>A great many people are dying around here this winter and spring. I attended two funerals
      yesterday. Our undertaker hd six orders for coffins last Saturday.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>An old gentleman 65 years of age, was coming to our house with a basket
      
      of eggs, for papa to take to Paterson to market, when he fell down in the road, and
      expired in an hour or two.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Papa, George &amp; I had quite a tramp last week—we went to New York Monday morning with the first train and came back Tuesday night. Monday morning we
      went to Fulton Ferry, and found Uncle George at work, driving stage—We went up town
      in his stage, &amp; then walked up to the Park, where we spent about 2 Hours—saw a great
      many anamiles, a few birds, &amp;c, &amp;c., but the monkeys, were best, of all—We then went down town,
      and got dinner, then walked up broadway to 14th St. here we met Uncle George, on his way down town, and Papa went with him, while George,
      &amp; I went to a Museum of Art—We saw a great many things to amuse us, such as paintings,
      sculptures 
      
      on wood &amp; on stone, ancient armour, ancient dishes, Books, &amp;c. &amp;c. When we came from
      there we went to the cor of 14th st. &amp; B.way, to meet Papa—we then walked around, seeing all we could, till we got very tired—then
      we went and sat down awhile, &amp; then up to 43rd st. to meet Uncle George—then we soon went to bed.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Tuesday we took the street cars &amp; went to the Park, walked through the Park &amp; took
      the street cars to High Bridge. Here we saw a fine structure—we were there awhile
      &amp; then took the Hnd. R. R R to 43rd st.. We now got down town, over the ferry, &amp; home.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have written this, but don't know if it will interest you or not.</p>
   
   
   <p>There fell some snow Friday, &amp; is not gone yet, it is quite cold.
      
      Garrie, Georgi , Dick, &amp; Mary, are amusing themselves by riding one another around the room, on their
      Backs.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now, I have written a good long letter, &amp; you must answer it soon.</p>
   
   
   <p>I hope you will improve with the warm weather.</p>

      So Good Bye
      <br></br>from your loving friend
      <br></br>Walt. Whitman Storms.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>P.S. I gave Uncle George the letter you sent me, &amp; he said he would write to you,
      but if he will or not I do not know.
