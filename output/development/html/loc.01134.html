      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:       
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter came the other day, &amp; with the enclosure was very welcome.<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r1">1</a></sup> The papers came also. I am glad you keep well. I wish for you here daily, it is so
      cool &amp; salubrious. I imagined you off to some of the watering places. I was sorry
      I could not bring about the arrangement to have you come up to our place, but Emma
      has not been very well, &amp; though
      
      
      
      she said yes, I thought she was a little reluctant, and our own household economy
      was deranged by the cuttings up &amp; running off of the girl. But I shall not rest till
      I have you up there.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was much interested in the letters you enclosed. I must write to the Gilchrists.</p>
   
   
   <p>I made the trip down the Delaware the last of June, all alone; went only to Hancock
      on the Erie Road, about 50 miles. Had a pretty good time, tho' lonely. I was not quite
      a week on the river. I slept in my boat or under it all the time. The next week after
      I returned home I wrote up my trip
      
      
      for the magazine, using the health &amp; strength I gained on the voyage. Since I have
      been here I have written an article on Nature &amp; the Poets, showing when our poets
      trip on their wood lore &amp; natural history, &amp; where they hit the mark. I catch them
      all napping. Emerson, Bryant, Whittier, Longfellow, &amp;c. I shall have something to
      say about you, with extracts, but I cannot catch you in any mistake, as I wish I could,
      for that is my game. I wish I could also find a slip in Shakspeare, or Tennyson, but I cannot according to my knowledge except where Shakspear follows the unscientific thought of his times, as in his treatment of the honey bee.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yesterday I wrote a sort
      
      
      of Pastoral Letter to The Tribune, but I doubt if they find it worth while, &amp; it is no matter.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will send you the proof of the article on the poets, before it goes into the magazine.</p>
   
   
   <p>There are two articles in the August Appleton's Journal that are worth glancing over,
      Arnold on Wordsworth &amp; Earl D. on Moose Hunting.<sup><a href="#loc.01134_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> What simple good hearty fellows those English earls must be; not a false or conventional
      note in this one.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The baby is doing well &amp; completely fills my heart. Wife is about as usual.</p>
   
   
   <p>I find I cannot read Whittier<sup><a href="#n1029" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; Longfellow<sup><a href="#n0367" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; Lowell<sup><a href="#n1026" id="r5">5</a></sup> with any satisfaction. Your poems spoil me for any but the greatest. Coming from
      them to you is like coming from a hothouse to the shore or the mountain. I know this
      is so &amp; is no pre-determined partiality of mine.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0129">1. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01134_n1">2. These pieces are Matthew
      Arnold's "Wordsworth" and "Moose-Hunting in Canada" by the Earl of Dunraven,
      Windham Wyndham-Quin. See <em>Appletons' Journal: A Magazine of
         General Literature</em>, 7.2 (New York: D. Appleton and Company, August
      1879).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1029">3. John Greenleaf Whittier
      (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
      slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
      surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
      Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
      volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (various publishers: 1906–1996) and Whitman's "My Tribute to Four Poets,"
      in <em>Specimen Days</em> (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh &amp; Co.,
      1882–'83), 180–181.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0367">4. In his time, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
      (1807–1882) was both a highly popular and highly respected American poet.
      His <em>The Song of Hiawatha</em>, published the same year as <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, enjoyed sales never reached by Whitman's
      poetry. When Whitman met Longfellow in June 1876, he was unimpressed: "His
      manners were stately, conventional—all right but all careful . . . he did
      not branch out or attract" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906], 1:129–130).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1026">5. James Russell Lowell
      (1819–1891), one of Whitman's famous poetic contemporaries, was committed
      to conventional poetic form, which was clearly at odds with Whitman's more
      experimental form. Still, as editor of the <em>Atlantic
         Monthly</em>, he published Whitman's "Bardic Symbols," probably at Ralph
      Waldo Emerson's suggestion. Lowell later wrote a tribute to Abraham Lincoln
      titled "Commemoration Ode," which has often, since its publication, been
      contrasted with Whitman's own tribute, "O Captain! My Captain!"<a href="#r5">[back]
