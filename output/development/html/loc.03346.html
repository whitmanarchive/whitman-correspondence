      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt: 
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>I enclose for your information a letter I got yesterday from Dr. Channing<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n5" id="r1">1</a></sup> about the calendar,<sup><a href="#n4181" id="r2">2</a></sup> which reads well.
   </p>
   
   <p>Today I have a letter from Stedman,<sup><a href="#n1043" id="r3">3</a></sup> in which he cordially
      undertakes the task of getting a publisher. I think this very good of him, as he is
      quite driven with all sorts of commissions.
   </p>
   
   <p>I feel sorry that the  delay of last year, prevented our getting Mr. Stetson<sup><a href="#n6144" id="r4">4</a></sup> to draw the
      picture I wrote you of for the card, because he is a man of singular genius, and
      appreciates deeply <u>Leaves of Grass</u>, the central sum of
      which, and permeating all its parts without exception, is, he thinks, spirituality.
      I think he would have given us something rarely good — something artistically
      bold, anyway, though maybe not. But he cannot do it this year, and I understand is
      getting ready to go for study to Italy.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I did not know that the <u>M.S.</u> of the calendar was to be
      placed in Stedman's hands, but it could not be better nor friendlier.
   </p>
   
   <p>Send me back the letter when you have done with it, that I may write to Dr. Channing,
      who has been very laborious and earnest in the matter. Grace,<sup><a href="#loc.03346_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> the cherub deviser of
      the scheme, is now up at Bristol, Rhode Island.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been much comforted by the newspaper reports about you, as by your card of
      the
      27th ultimo, though I realize how badly ill you still must be. But I have strong hopes.
      If you  can but weather
      the summer!
   </p>
   
   <p>I myself am pretty bad— very back-achy and weak-leggy. But, like Webster, we
      still live, and who can get us under!
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad you can sit up and work a little on your book,<sup><a href="#loc.03346_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> which must be a comfort.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have another letter from Dr. Bucke,<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r7">7</a></sup> whom I treat
      disgracefully, not answering promptly. But it is pretty hard to write and keep the
      office stone rolled up the hill daily.
   </p>
   
   <p>All consolation! All cheer!</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00945_n5">1. William F. Channing
      (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
      Whitman stayed at his home in October, 1868.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4181">2. Grace Ellery Channing, O'Connor's
      niece, came up with the idea of producing a calendar with selected quotations
      from Whitman's poetry, to be illustrated by Charles Walter Stetson. O'Connor,
      Edmund Clarence Stedman, and others worked on the project, which Whitman did not
      approve of and which never came to fruition. For more information on Channing
      and the Calendar, see Joann Krieg,
      "Grace Ellery
      Channing and the Whitman Calendar," <em>Walt Whitman
         Quarterly Review</em> 12 (Spring 1995), 252–256.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1043">3. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6144">4. Charles Walter Stetson
      (1858–1911) was a visual artist, often described as a "colorist." He
      married writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman in 1884, and the couple divorced
      amicably in 1894. Soon after, he married Grace Ellery Channing.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03346_n1">5. Grace Ellery Channing
      (1862–1937) was a poet; she was the daughter of William F. Channing and
      the niece of William D. O'Connor.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03346_n2">6. Whitman at this time was
      working on both <em>November Boughs</em> and <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em>, both published in 1888.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">7. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
