   </p> 
   
   
   <p>I am spending a few days down at the old farm, "White Horse"<sup><a href="#upa.00019_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—wandering most all day (well clad &amp; shod, for it is cool weather here) about the
      banks, trees, grass &amp;c. by the very secluded beautiful druidic creek—have just picked
      up a few leaves that seem'd to offer 
      themselves to send specially to you, which I enclose.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am feeling middling well, for me. Shall send you word—or rather shall send <u>myself</u>—soon as 
      I come back to town—Meanwhile love to you all—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00019_n1">1. Whitman was at the
      Stafford farm in Kirkwood from October 10 to 19 (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Whitman called on the Gilchrists
      frequently in Philadelphia after their arrival on September 10, and was
      accompanied by John Burroughs on September 14 and 15 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r1">[back]
