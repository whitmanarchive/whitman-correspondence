   <p>I received the "November Boughs" and like the general get up of the book much. It
      was
      a first, writing , + one wonders what it contains, 
      good—good! The most I have had time for yet is the Hicks<sup><a href="#n0301" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      article. I think you have done good work for the long ,
      It is , inspiring, picture-like. It the all book bins of Richmond mine
      was so clear listed, I shared verdict that they would buy copies of the book by the
      scribe, but my experience with them was that they titled after the list of things
      that enclosed them support, harcumvdashy, to the foot. Blake is very much pleasure
      after the book, while I explain give it a givrescinptom in their <u>clirty</u>.

   <p>I hear by Donner that you are moderately on finished + traveling on as your wife
      instructs. Do you sense that is about the summing up for us all—moderatly, +c,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0301">1. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker from Long
      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his
      influence on Whitman, see David S. Reynolds, <em>Walt Whitman's
         America</em> (New York: Knopf, 1995), 37–39.<a href="#r1">[back]
