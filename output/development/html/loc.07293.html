   <p>I have had the Inspector here since thursday evening—he went East (to Toronto)
      this morning. All quiet again and nobody hurt—This morning I got the little
      bundle of papers (Aug. 87)<sup><a href="#loc.07293_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> from you, many thanks. We
      have had another fall of snow yesterday and last night, quite a lot came down,
      several inches. It is now (under the influence of quite a warm sun) departing as
      rapidly as it came, by tomorrow evening (if the weather keeps as now) it will be all
      gone. I am still reading Brockden Brown<sup><a href="#loc.07293_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and he interest me a good deal, more than I
      had expected. No letters from any of our friends and no news. I trust you are
      easier—I wish I could in any way make you more comfortable, perhaps by &amp;
      by I shall be able

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
