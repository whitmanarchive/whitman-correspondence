   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Dixon (1831–1880), a corkcutter of
      Sunderland, England, was one of Walt Whitman's early English admirers. In 1856
      he had bought copies of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> from a book
      peddler; one of these copies was later sent by William B. Scott to William
      Michael Rossetti. Dixon vigorously supported cultural projects and represented
      the ideal laborer of John Ruskin, who printed many of his own letters to the
      corkcutter in <em>Time and Tide</em> (1867). See <em>Autobiographical Notes of the Life of William Bell Scott</em>, ed. W. Minto
      (1892), II, 32–33, 267–269; Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt
         Whitman in England</em> (1934), 15–17; <em>The Works of
         John Ruskin</em>, ed. E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn (1905), XVII,
      lxxviii–lxxix.

      (1837-1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, DC, in 1864, even though
      Burroughs had frequented Pfaff's beer cellar, where he consistently defended
      Whitman's poetry, in 1862. After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman
      commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs
      was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the correspondence between the two
      men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would
      write several books involving or devoted to Whitman's work: <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Notes on Walt Whitman as
         Poet and Person</em> (1867), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896),
