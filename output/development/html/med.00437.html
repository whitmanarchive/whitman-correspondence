      <br></br><br></br>Dear John Burroughs,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you a letter, &amp;c. I rec'd from Dowden, as you are alluded to. I have written
      to Dowden, today, &amp; sent it off—so I suppose he will send you the books alluded to.
      Mine have arrived—Dowden advances, expands, or rather <em>penetrates</em>—the first two Chapters of his Shakespere, which I have read thoroughly, are very fine—(I have underlined passages
      on every page)<sup><a href="#med.00437_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> —the Victor Hugo I have not yet read<sup><a href="#med.00437_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> —
   </p>
   
   
   <p>. . . I am pretty strong yet, &amp; go out—but head, stomach &amp; liver, all in a bad way,
      &amp; seems as if nothing could bring them round. 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Have rec'd a long &amp; good letter from Rossetti<sup><a href="#med.00437_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> which I will show you when you come. How are you getting along? How is 'Sula? . .
      .

      The presentation copy of Dowden's <em>
         Shakspere
         
         : A Critical Study of His Mind and Art</em> (London: Henry S.
      King, 1875), now in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., is marked
      on every page for the first eighty pages but only sporadically after that,
      although there are underlined passages throughout the entire volume. The
      underscoring in various kinds of pencils and comments dated in the 1880s
      indicate that Whitman examined Dowden's study several times.<br><br>
      In his reply to Whitman on ,
      Burroughs was not impressed with Dowden's book: "It does not differ very
      much from the rest of the critical literature of that subject, I do not yet
      see that it throws any new light. His Victor Hugo article strikes me as much
      more masterly." <a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00437_n3">3. Dowden referred to his
      article on Hugo in a letter to Whitman on : "There is much in common between Victor Hugo &amp; you, but if I
      had to choose between 'Leaves of Grass' &amp; 'La Légende des Siècles'
      I should have not a moment's hesitation in throwing away 'La Légende'." To
      Burroughs on June 9, 1875, Dowden admitted that "my article on Victor Hugo is
      only partially satisfactory" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.; Horace
      Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.31.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996], 3:216). In a
      postscript he inquired about Whitman's physical comforts because a Camden
      newspaper which he had seen had described the poet as "ill and <em>indigent</em>." <a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00437_n4">4. On , William Michael Rossetti discussed
      his literary activities, his insertion of notices about Walt Whitman in the
      London <em>Academy</em>, and his marriage in 1874 to the daughter
      of Ford Madox Brown, the painter.<a href="#r4">[back]
