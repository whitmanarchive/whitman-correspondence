   <p>Mother dear, I suppose you got a letter from me telling you that I had been down stairs
      
      &amp; out on Monday—it was more exertion than I could bear, and I have not been so well
      since. 
      I got two letters from Jeff to-day, the last one dated the 16th<sup><a href="#nyp.00307_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Matt had rested well the night before—
      poor, poor Mat, I am ready to hear to her departure any day—it seems terrible—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Things are going on as well as could be expected with me, but slowly—
      I overdid the matter day before yesterday, and am now waiting—
      I am sitting up by the stove alone writing this. Love [to] you, dearest Mother, and
      to all—
      
   </p>

   <p id="nyp.00307_n1">1. Jeff's letter to Walt
      Whitman is not known. Writing to his mother on February 15 and 16, 1873, he
      begged her to travel to St. Louis: "It seems to be the one desire of [Martha's]
      life to have you come and see her" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
