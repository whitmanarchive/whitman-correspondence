   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00426_n14">1. This letter dates to March
      19, 1863. "March 19" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard Maurice
      Bucke dated the letter to the year 1863. Edwin Haviland Miller dated the letter
      March 19?, 1873 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:373). The quizzical "th"
      could be the abandoned word "Thursday": March 19 fell on Thursday in 1863. Or it
      could be the word "th[e?]" as part of an abandoned postscript. The letter
      coincided with the end of George Washington Whitman's ten-day furlough. Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in his 
      letter to Walt Whitman reported George's arrival in Brooklyn on "Sunday morning"
      (March 8) for a ten-day furlough. George departed from Brooklyn on Tuesday,
      March 17, two days before this letter. The date March 19, 1863 is
      certain.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00426_n1">2. In March 1863 George
      Washington Whitman (1829–1901) returned home to Brooklyn for the first
      time in sixteen months on a ten-day furlough, which ended on March 17. He
      returned to his regiment in Newport News, Virginia. George was the sixth child
      of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and he was ten years
      younger than Walt Whitman. He enlisted in the Union army in 1861 and remained on
      active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle
      of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of
      Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and
      began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and later a
      mason named French. George also took a position as inspector of pipes in
      Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">3. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00423_n3">4. Andrew Jackson Whitman
      (1827–1863) was Walter Whitman, Sr., and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son,
      and Walt Whitman's brother. Andrew developed a drinking problem that contributed
      to his early death, leaving behind his wife Nancy McClure Whitman, who was
      pregnant with son Andrew, Jr., and their two sons, George "Georgy" and James
      "Jimmy." For more on Andrew, see Martin G. Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 10:3 (1993),
      142–148.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00423_n4">5. Nancy McClure Whitman was
      the wife of Walt Whitman's brother, Andrew Jackson Whitman. James "Jimmy" and
      George "Georgy" were Nancy and Andrew's sons, and Nancy was pregnant with
      Andrew, Jr., when her husband died in December 1863. Andrew, Jr., died in 1868,
      and Georgy died in 1872. For Nancy and her children, see Jerome M. Loving, ed.,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00426_n11">6. Walt Whitman, in his  letter to Thomas Jefferson Whitman,
      reported his hope that "the bundle of George's shirts, drawers, &amp;c came safe
      by Adams Express. I sent it last Saturday." Adams Express, a packet delivery
      service, was noted for its fast delivery, trustworthiness, and its guarantee of
      privacy for shippers (see Hollis Robbins, "Fugitive Mail: The Deliverance of
      Henry 'Box' Brown and Antebellum Postal Politics," <em>American
         Studies</em> 50:1/2 [2009], 12–13). Robert Roper has traced the many
      references to these flannel shirts in the Whitman family's early 1863
      correspondence (<em>Now the Drum of War</em> [New York: Walker and
      Company, 2008], 204–206).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00426_19">7. According to the <em>Brooklyn City Directory</em> (1863), Gabriel Harrison was a
      photographer at 73 Fulton Avenue. He was a friend of Whitman's and took the
      daguerreotypes that Whitman used for the engraved portrait of himself that
      appeared in the 1855 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In
      addition to being an award-winning daguerreotypist, Harrison was also a writer,
      actor, painter, and stage manager, and he remained for Whitman one of the true
      artisan-heroes of the era.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">8. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r8">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n6">12. Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George

   <p id="duk.00426_n8">14. Charles Louis Heyde

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00426_n13">17. Because the letter dates to
      May 1863, the nickname "Sis" refers to Manahatta Whitman (1860–1886), the
      elder daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother, and
      his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. In later letters, Jessie Louisa
      Whitman (1863–1957), born in June, acquired the nickname "Sis" when
      Manahatta became "Hattie."<a href="#r17">[back]

   <p id="duk.00426_n12">18. Crullers are a "cake cut
      from dough containing eggs, butter, sugar, etc., twisted or curled into various
      shapes, and fried to crispness in lard or oil" (<em>Oxford English
         Dictionary</em>).<a href="#r18">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n13">19. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r19">[back]
