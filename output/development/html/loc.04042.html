   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04042_n1">1. This note is written at
      the top of a proof sheet entitled "Walt Whitman Last Night,"
      which Whitman had obviously placed in type before he gave his lecture. Although
      the letters are not extant, probably the poet sent similar notes to the editors
      of the Chicago <em>Tribune</em>, the Cincinnati <em>Commercial</em>, and to the Philadelphia <em>Press</em>.
      There is the possibility that Whitman prepared this copy but did not send it. At
      the bottom of the sheet Whitman appended a note: "<u>to
         printer</u> dont mind the different type."<a href="#r1">[back]
