      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you got my postal card. I am still about the same as then—or, if any different,
      
      it is on the side of relief &amp; improvement—I have the feeling to go out &amp; try to get
      around—have better spirits than I could expect—but on trial, the least exertion confuses
      my head, 
      &amp; overcomes me. But I am sitting here at present in my room, comparatively comfortable—&amp;
      feel every hope that I shall be able to give better account of myself next week. 
      I am still clear of the pronounced bad spells of seven or eight days ago—a great gain
      &amp; let-up. The weather here is fine.
      
   </p>

   <p>Isn't that Evangelical Alliance a pretty kettle of fish? I read the Tribune through
      every day.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>."
