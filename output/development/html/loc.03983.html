   </p>
   
   
   <p>I thought I would write a few lines to you and let you know how I am. I cannot get
      you off my mind somehow. I heard something that made me feel bad, and I saw that you
      did not want to bid me good bye when you went away yesterday. I will tell you what
      it was. I heard that you was going to Washington and stay and be gon fore some time, is it so? I thought it was very strange in you, in not saying
      
      
      
      anything to me about it. I think of it all the time, I cannot get my mind on my work
      the best I can do. I should like to come up to Camden next week, and stay all night
      with you if I could, but I suppose I can not do it. I wish you would write to me soon and let me know how you are. Things are
      verry dull down <u>here</u> to day, there isn't any Excursion to day and It is <u>quiet</u> and I don't like it very well. There was an Excursion here 
      
      
      
      yesterday, it was given by a <u>rich</u> man of Philadel. to the poor children of the ward in which he lived, there was over 200 on it. They
      appeared to enjoy it verry well. I was up there in the afternoon a little while. Mother<sup><a href="#n1039" id="r2">2</a></sup> got home all safe last night, she was home when I got there. Perhaps I will be up
      Wednesday night in the 6 train, I will if I can, if I do I will have to come back
      on the Earley train in the morning so I will be in time to help Mr.
      
      
      
      Sharp load the car's. I am sitting by the window and the flys are almost eating me up. We have been trying
      to kill them but seems to me the more we kill of them the more we have. Mr. Sharp
      got out of patience in trying so he took the <u>poison</u> out this morning. I have got to scrub the office out <u>this afternoon</u>, so you can imagin me down on the floor. Good <u>bie</u> write if it pleases you.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0590">1. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n1039">2. Susan Stafford, mother of Harry
      Stafford, a young man who Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's parents,
      George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near
      Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. For more
      on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G. Miller, "Stafford, George and Susan
