      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Mr Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I am here in these mountains and all around me nature in all her 
      lovliness
      
       stands forth. The far distant woods, the singing birds, the many different
      noted birds and the sparkling dew on the grass and shrubbery all tell to me the same
      tale A tale of peacefulness and isolation from the busy, busy, striving Cities To
      me every thing is as the picture of a dream—a pleasant dream—from which I shall
      soon awake—Time 
      flys
      
       by me on winged wheels and the length of my stay is being brought to an
      end. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Behind me rise high and [
      <span class="unclear">vapory?</span>]
      
       blue a lone
      Mountain to whose heights I aspire to climb and on its top to place an American
      flag—Such has been the custom here so to do for many many years. I will follow in
      the footsteps of my parents as in their young days they did the very same thing. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Having been told so many times at my mothers knee of how she did these things when
      she was young. It will be poetry now to me to do so myself Poetry is in the Soul
      and from the Soul and it delights my Soul to do these things over again as my
      parents did them. I see many friends and many who were friends of my Father and
      Mother. It has been 12 years since last I was here and to many I am a "regular
      suprise
      
      
      
      party" Hearing them talk of long ago makes me feel as if I were a living monument
      on
      the road of Time. A Zeus with compelling arm pointing backwards making man and woman
      alike review the past. Or an ordinary "finger post" marked, so many miles to Then.
      I
      have walked a great deal since I arrived here and enjoyed them very much. The
      climate is beginning to affect me now as it does all new comers. It makes one very
      
      drowzy
      
       and sleepy but in that it is very beneficial as it rests one and makes
      them fat—It is a case of sleep and grow fat instead of laugh  and grow fat. It takes several
      days to recover from the feeling and get acclimated but after that has been done one
      is ready for any thing—I am sorry to hear of your having been overcome by the heat
      and hope you have sustained no serious injury, I myself am well and now close with
      much love to you 
   </p>
