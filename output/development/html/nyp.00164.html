   </p>
   
   <p>It is with an aching heart that I address you this morning. I recd yours of the 2nd
      [This letter is currently lost] telling us of Oscars<sup><a href="#nyp.00164_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> condition last Wednesday. I was going to start right of to see him I would have come
      long ago but he thought not, so did you. this time I intended to go whether anyone
      thought best or not but the same eve Liut Perry came bringing us the sad news of his
      death but did not tell us any of the particulars
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr Whitman will you be so kind as to tell us all the particulars concerning Oscar
      was he expecting death to come so soon or did he leave any messages for us. the least
      thing from him will be interesting to me we were not expecting to hear of his death
      as all the news we got were favorable of late nor can we realise it yet we will try
      and submit to Gods will and feel that he does all things well  we hope our loss is
      for his gain. I feel that you was Oscars friend and will be ours and again we thank
      you and will ever feel grateful to you for the kindness you have shown. I hope to
      hear from you soon yours with respect
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00164_n2">1. "Oscar Cunningham, a
      young farmer from Delaware, Ohio, ... was wounded on May 3, 1863, in the Battle
      of Chancellorsville. Upon seeing him at Armory Square in June, Whitman was
      immediately struck by the beauty of the tall and fair soldier: 'Oscar H
      Cunningham bed 20 Ward K, Ohio boy, large, (told me he had usually weighed 200
      lb) fracture of leg, above knee, rather bad—(a fine, magnificent specimen of
      western manliness).' Almost a full year after Oscar's arrival at Armory Square,
      Whitman noted that Oscar's 'leg is in a horrible condition, all livid &amp;
      swollen out of shape—the chances are against him poor fellow.' On May 1, 1864,
      the doctors amputated Cunningham's right leg, and Whitman wrote on Oscar's
      behalf to his family, expressing new hope for Cunningham's recovery and telling
      them that it was unnecessary to make the long trip East. By June 3, however,
      Whitman told his own mother that the soldier he had visited for so long was near
      death: I have just left Oscar Cunningham, the Ohio boy—he is in a dying
      condition—there is no hope for him—it would draw tears from the hardest heart to
      look at him—his is all wasted away to a skeleton, &amp; looks like some one
      fifty years old—you remember I told you a year ago, when he was first brought
      in, I thought him the noblest specimen of a young western man I had seen, a real
      giant in size, &amp; always with a smile on his face—O what a change, he has
      long been very irritable, to every one but me, &amp; his frame is all wasted
      away. Cunningham died on June 4, 1864, and was one of the first soldiers to be
      buried in the new Arlington National Cemetery. (Martin G. Murray, "Traveling
      with the Wounded: Walt Whitman and Washington's Civil War Hospitals," <em>Washington History: Magazine of the Historical Society of
