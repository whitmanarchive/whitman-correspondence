      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have delayed writing to you longer than I intended to. We had a pleasant passage
      over, &amp; have been as happy as sight seers can expect to be. We keep pretty well
      &amp; take things easy. My first taste of the country was at Alloway, Burns'
      birth place. We spent a week here in a cozy little inn on the banks of the Doon,
      surrounded by one of the sweetest &amp; finest farming countries I ever beheld. From
      there we went up into the Highlands, where I did some
      
      
      mountain climbing: thence around
      to Edinburgh. From there we went down to Carlyle's country &amp; spent a week at
      Ecclefechan, arriving there the 1<u>st</u> day of June just as the first red clover was
      beginning to bloom. I walked a good deal about Ecclefechan &amp; shall write something
      about it &amp; weave in certain things I want to say of Carlyle. I enclose a daisy &amp;
      a spray of speedwell that I gathered from Carlyles grave. There is no stone yet
      marking his grave. I saw the graves of 8 "Thomas Carlyles." The "Carlyls" as the
      Scotch call them were a numerous race in this section. They were a stern savage set,
      not to be trifled with. One old Scotchman said they were "bullies." Then we went
      down into the Lake region for a few days;
      
      
      &amp; thence to London. Mr.
      Carpenter has been up &amp; spent a day &amp; a night with me. He has recently lost his
      father. He is well. We have been out to Mrs. Gilchrist's twice to tea She &amp; Grace
      are alone, Herbert being off in Wales, painting. They chided me for not bringing
      you, &amp; entertain hopes of seeing you yet. They are well &amp; have a pleasant cheery
      house. You would have a good time if you were to come. I have seen no one else in
      London &amp; do not expect to. Rossetti I hear is not well. We shall leave here
      to-morrow, or I shall, for Haslemere &amp; thence through some of the Southern
      Countries for a week; wife &amp; Julian will stay with an old acquaintance of ours at
      Brentford, near London. I presume we shall be home in August. June has been cold &amp;
      wet
       here: no
      heat, no warmth.
   </p>
   
   <p>Conway has an article on Emerson in the June Fortnightly Review, but it is hasty &amp;
      of not much account. I hope to hear yet that Osgood has not thrown up <u>Leaves of Grass</u>. I expect a letter from O'Connor every
      day. Drop me a line care of <u>Henderson Brothers, 51 Union Street,
         Glasgow</u> Scotland.
