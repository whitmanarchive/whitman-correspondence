      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have indeed been extremely sorry to hear firstly from the transmitted paper of July
      23 and then from your kind letter of July 31, that your prospects of recovering your
      health seem to have darkened forever. You are no old man, and I had always hoped
      that your giant frame at last should supersede the lurking enemy. Even yet I won't
      give up the hope. That you don't give up your literary activity is to me a good
      token!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>From Kristian Elster I have not heard myself in a very long
      time, and I don't wonder that he has not written to you. He is a true virginal
      nature with the shyness of a virgin. As he was nearly suffocated by the dullness and
      coarse materialism of the Norwegian Society, I pressed him for
      two years ago (when he had previously sent me some very fine articles for my
      periodical) to come for some months to Copenhagen. I introduced [him] to some of the
      leading literary men and in some rich families, but he did not come to them and I
      myself must fetch him in his lodging, when I would see him. It seemed to him to be
      an intrusion to pay a visit, when not expressly asked to come! This is the fruit of
      a lonely education in stern and harsh national surroundings. The Norsemen can be
      described in the shy ones and the impudent ones.
      Björnson and Ole Bull are of the
      last sort, Elster of the first. The meanest sort—as usual—has first
      produced <em>its</em> gifted men: when the better sort in its time has
      sprung into flowers, they shall all be forgotten. Then as truly as Denmark is at
      this moment doing the principal part of the intellectual work of the Scandinavian
      race, its accomplishment is kept back to Norway.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The intellectual work of the Scandinavian race! What a humiliating thought to us
      Danes, that Hans Christian Andersen shall be nearly our only 
      representant
      
       to the world. There are men in Denmark of such an intellectual greatness
      that Andersen was not reaching to their knees. The world did to his last days take
      the selfish old man for a child; the spirit of the Danish people is <em>no</em> child; it [is] a warrior with the sword in his hand
      bleeding from combats, when he fought one against seven, with great thoughts of his
      brow and stern resolution in his eyes! At last Andersen lived only among our rich
      Jewish families, who endured all his whims and harshness, hoping to be gilt by his
      frame. He was buried as he had lived. The King and the Crown Prince were in the
      church, reporters for foreign papers, also from America, swarmed everywhere; but
      there was no wet eye in whole assembly.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But our time shall come! Most probably America, in the next century, shall be the
      vanguard of humanity, its greatest leading power. But <em>your</em>
      eyes will not be open to see the outlines filled your bold hand has drawn. As 
      representants
      
       for mental power and intellectual vigor such people as Bret Harte and Mark Twain are fainting away into
      ridiculousness. <em>Ours</em> is the <em>next</em>
      future. You have no idea of the intellectual decay that in Germany is accompanying
      the political grandeur of the country. In June I met with professors and teachers
      of
      the university who in all earnest were Buddhists, believers of nothings, or properly
      spoken, believing that <em>nothing</em> is the true reality of the
      existence of world and man. <em>This</em> is the dark and black gulf
      that Goethe and Schiller decked with the
      flowers and branches of their genius. At present the flowers and foliage are fading,
      and the black fathomless abyss of despair opens its giant yawn to the horrified
      mind. The faith, the youth, the hope, the vigor of spirits, the soaring flight of
      lofty aspiration, is only to be found in Scandinavia. Martin Luther spoke the prophetic word: in the north is the place of refuge!
      The day of the fulfillment is near.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have never doubted that I could make myself understood to you, and a letter of
      business or concerning the usual affairs of human life I could most probably write
      without faults at all, when I did take pains with it. But all the striking
      expressions, all the elaborate work of the thought, is fading away beneath my
      feather, when treating more difficult matters in English. I am never saying exactly
      what I would say, and you know, my dear friend, that this is a great pain to anyone
      who is accustomed to clothe his thoughts in the garment of language. I shall be glad
      to receive your new books. A Danish philosopher defines a hero as a man who is
      holding on the possible against probability.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The Swede Peter Carl Rudolph
      Schmidt (1836–1899) was the editor of the idealist <em>For
         Idé og Virkelighed</em> ("For Idea and Reality") and had translated
      Whitman's <em>Democratic Vistas</em> into Danish in 1871 (see the
      letter from Schmidt to Whitman of ).
