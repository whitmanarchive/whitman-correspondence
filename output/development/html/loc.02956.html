      <br></br><br></br>Dear W.W.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The precious volume 'November Boughs'<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r1">1</a></sup> arrived last night and drew forth an exclamation of delight
      from me as I untied the package at the supper table. The portrait was a real surprise,
      &amp; I value very highly
      the portrait of E. Hicks,<sup><a href="#n0301" id="r2">2</a></sup> a <u>remarkable</u> face. A [
      <span class="unclear">god-smit?</span>]
       man of the old heroic stamp.
   </p>
   
   <p>The mélange of the vol. exhibits a range &amp; strength that I had not tho't
      to be quite so marked, when I read the pieces separately as they came out. The very
      <u>mass</u> is wonderful, considering that they emanate from a
      semi-invalid.
   </p>
   
   <p>I thank you deeply for the beautiful vol. &amp; for its inscription, &amp; the good nice Sunday-afternoon
      letter. I devoured the new poems &amp; prose pieces bit by bit, 
      stealhily
      
       to-day, having the book (disguised by cover) in my drawer, whence I took
      it out to read from time to time.
   </p>
   
   <p>I notice a deepening shade of the 
      sombre  
       
       &amp; of pathos throughout the <u>latest</u> bits of
      poetry. But it is better so: it completes your picture of a typical man—a man
      complete, clear through the "opiate" shades to the gates of death.
   </p>
   
   <p>The plaster bust I still hold  in trust. Mr. Sanborn<sup><a href="#n0915" id="r3">3</a></sup> accepted it for the
      Concord School.<sup><a href="#n3031" id="r4">4</a></sup> But as the School is closed for the following
      year, I suppose he neglects to call for it. I shall take occasion to speak of it
      (indirectly) some day, &amp; follow his directions. The bust shall surely go into <u>some</u> gallery, or I'll be busted myself. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope to write a notice of the 'Boughs' for the <u>Transcript</u>.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      affectionately &amp; admiringly 
      <br></br>your friend
      <br></br>W. S. Kennedy
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Sorry indeed to hear of O'Connor's<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r5">5</a></sup> bad state. We all need
      out'o'door life continually.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>P.S. I am so sorry to hear so much of your bad digestion &amp; lethargy. Don't you
      think you ought to take a railway sleeper for Florida this winter?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="n3999">1. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus

   <p id="n0301">2. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker from Long
      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his

   <p id="n0915">3. Franklin B. Sanborn
      (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
      he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
      the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
      reviewed <em>Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Boston
         Commonwealth</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00059.html">February 24, 1866</a>. He was editor of the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
      his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
      appeared without Sanborn's name in the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K. Walker,
