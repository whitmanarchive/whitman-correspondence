      ink shows through a little it does not obscure the reading any to hurt. Please do
      not forget to send me a copy (no doubt you have some printed as usual, a better yet
      if it would not be too much trouble to write of out for me—I should value an

      it that way—it is too awful—the hundreds of little children and women

      insignificance before the honor of it. I have written Harned<sup><a href="#n4146" id="r6">6</a></sup> to

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      dinner. For Whitman's thoughts about the dinner, see his , letter to William Sloane Kennedy and his , letter to Richard Maurice
      Bucke. See also Whitman's , letter to
      Horace Traubel, regarding the published volume of birthday speeches <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David

   <p id="loc.07306_n1">4. In his letter of , Whitman told Bucke that he sent a
      copy of the pocket-book edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. The
      poet had the special pocket-book edition printed in honor of his 70th
      birthday–May 31, 1889–through special arrangement with Frederick
      Oldach. See Whitman's , letter to
      Oldach. Only 300 copies were printed, and Whitman signed the title page of each
      one. The volume also included the annex <em>Sands at Seventy</em>
      and his essay <em>A Backward Glance O'er Traveled Roads</em>. For
      more information on the book see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> is described in the Sotheby &amp; Co
      (1935) and the American Art Association (1936) auction catalogues of his Whitman
      collection. The item is numbered 11 and 294, respectively.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="med.00874_n4">5. The Johnstown flood. In
      <em>The Commonplace-Book</em> Whitman wrote on June 1, 1889:
      "The most pervading &amp; dreadful news this m'ng is of the strange cataclysm at
      Johnstown &amp; adjoining Cambria County, Penn: by wh' many thousands of people
      are overwhelm'd, kill'd by drowning in water, burnt by fire, &amp;c:
      &amp;c:—all our hearts, the papers &amp; the public interest, are fill'd
      with it—the most signal &amp; wide-spread horror of the kind ever known in
      this country—curious that at this very hour, we were having the dinner
      festivities &amp;c—unaware." Browning, now the Philadelphia representative
      of the New York <em>World</em>, was instructed by Julius Chambers
      to ask the poet for "a threnody on the Johnstown dead," which became "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00052.html">A
         Voice from Death</a>" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.59.html">Wednesday, June 5, 1889</a>). The poem was first published in the <em>New York World</em> on June 7, 1889.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n4146">6. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel (1856–1914), was
      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

         Whitman's Friend and Literary Executor</em>, ed. Peter Van Egmond (Hartford:
      Transcendental Books, 1972).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n4284">8. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
