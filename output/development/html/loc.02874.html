      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Glad am I when the time comes round for writing to you again—though I can't
      please myself with my letters, poor little echoes that they are of the loving,
      hoping, far journeying thoughts so busy within. It has been a happy time since I  received the paper
      with the joyful news you were back at Washington, well on your way to recovery able
      partially to resume work—scenting from afar the fresh breeze &amp; sunshine of
      perfect health—by this time, not from afar, perhaps. The thought of that makes
      dull days bright [
      <span class="unclear">&amp;
         bright</span>]
       days glorious to me too.—I noted in the New York Graphic
      that a new edition of "Leaves of Grass" was called for  —sign truly that America is not so
      very slowly now absorbing the precious food she needs above all else? Perhaps dear
      Friend, even during your lifetime will begin to come the "proof you will alone
      accept,—that your country absorb you as affectionately as you have absorbed
      it." I have had two great pleasures since I last wrote you. One is that Herby has read with a large measure of  responsive delight
      Leaves of Grass quite through, so that he now sees you with his own eyes &amp; has
      in his heart the living growing germs of a loving [
      <span class="unclear">admiration that will grow with his
         growth</span>]
       &amp; strengthen every fibre of good in him—Also he read
      &amp; took much pride in my "Letters" now shown him for the first time. Percy has had a fortnight's holiday with us,
      [
      <span class="unclear">and looks
         better</span>]
      
       in health though still
      not altogether as I could wish. He says he is getting such good experience, he would
      not care just yet to change his post even for better pay. Music is his greatest
      pleasure—he seems to get more enjoyment out of that than out of literature,
      &amp; is acquiring some practical skill. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To–day (Feb. 25th) is my birthday, dearest Friend—a day my children
      always  make very
      bright &amp; happy to me: and on it they make me promise to "do nothing but what I
      like all day." So I shall spend it with you,—partly in finishing this letter,
      partly reading in the book that is so dear to me—for that is indeed my soul
      coming into the presence of your soul— filled by it with strength &amp; warmth
      &amp; joy.—In discouraged moods, when oppressed with the consciousness of my
      own limitations, 
      failures, lack of many beautiful gifts, I say to myself "What sort of a bird with
      unfledged wings are you that would mate with an eagle? Can your eyes look the sun
      in
      the face like his? Can you sustain year long, lifelong flights upward? Can you
      [
      <span class="unclear">nest?</span>]
       in dizzy rocks overhanging dark,
      tempestuous abysses? Is your heart like his, a great glowing sun of Love?" Then I
      answer "Give me  Time.
      I can bide my time,—a long long growing &amp; unfolding time. That he draws me
      with such power, that my soul has found the meaning of itself in him—the
      object of all its deep, deathless aspirations in comradeship with him, means, if
      life [
      <span class="unclear">is not a mockery
         clean</span>]
       ended by death, that the germs are in me, that through cleaving
      &amp; loving &amp; ever striving up &amp; on I shall grow like him—like but
      different—the correlative— What his soul needs &amp; desires;  And if when I reach
      America he is not so drawn towards me,—if seeing how often I disappoint
      myself, needs must that he too is disappointed, still I can hold bravely, lovingly
      on to this inextinguishable faith &amp; hope—with the added joy of his
      presence sometimes winning from him more &amp; more a dear friendship yielding him
      some joy  &amp;
      comfort—for he too turns with hope, with yearning, towards me—bids me be
      "satisfied &amp; at peace" So I am, so I will be my Darling. Surely surely, sooner
      or later I shall justify that hope satisfy that yearning. This is what I say to
      myself &amp; to you this 46th birthday Have I said it over [
      <span class="unclear">&amp; over</span>]
       again?
      That  is because it is
      the under current of my whole life.—The "Tribune" with Proctor's "Lecture on
      the Sun" (&amp; a great deal besides that interests me)
      came safe. A masterly lecture. And two days ago came the Philadelphia paper with
      Prof. Morton's speech—deeply interesting. And as I read these things, the
      feeling that they have come from, &amp; been read by, you turns them  into Poems for me.

   <p>W. Rossetti's marriage is

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
