   <p>It is now about noon, &amp; I have just come over to the office, and have put up the window
      
      for a few moments, to stand &amp; get the fresh air, &amp; then put it down again. Right opposite
      
      the window—in the President's grounds a man in his shirt-sleeves is raking up the
      grass 
      that has been already cut on a ¾ acre patch—so you can see spring has advanced here—the
      trees are quite green—

   <p>Mother, I have had the second application of electricity to-day, quite a good application
      by Dr. Drinkard—he rubs the handles over my leg &amp; thigh, for perhaps twenty minutes—the
      shock is very perceptible—it is not painful at all, feels something 
      like pressing a sore—I feel as I said before, that it will be beneficial to me, 
      (though there are different opinions about it)—I feel better to-day than yesterday—I
      think, mother dear, there is no doubt at all that I progress surely though very slowly,
      
      (&amp; with an occasional bad spell)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Did you read in the morning papers to-day about the fight with the Modocs out in California—&amp;
      Col. Mason—I think (but am not sure) it is Jule Mason<sup><a href="#med.00420_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—it is quite interesting—I am going to work for a couple of hours now at my work in
      the office books—I am feeling quite comfortable this afternoon.

   <p id="med.00420_n2">2.  Whitman was mistaken. It
      was Colonel E. C. Mason, not his old friend Julius Mason. The warfare with the
      Modocs lasted from November 29, 1872, to October 3, 1873; see Keith A. Murray,
      <em>The Modocs and Their War</em> (Norman: University of
      Oklahoma Press, 1959), 318–319.<a href="#r2">[back]
