      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend, 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have (yesterday) sent a P.O.O for £2 for your 2 vols.<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r1">1</a></sup> They are ordered by Edward T. Wilkinson, 13 Micklegate, York—to whom please send
      them. He is a haberdasher in a large way of business—a very straight &amp; true man. I
      hear from <u>Vines</u><sup><a href="#n1042" id="r2">2</a></sup> that your books have arrived. He &amp; <u>Thompson</u> (to whom you sent before) are lecturers at
      
      
      
      Cambridge, <u>Haweis</u> is a popular London preacher, <u>Templeton</u> is working music in London—organizing cheap concerts &amp;c.— and <u>Teall</u> is teaching science at Nottingham. Your other two vols went to <u>Carlile</u> a solicitor at Hull. So you see the kind of audience that you have.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I want to say how splendid I think your 'Children of Adam.' I was reading those pieces
      again the other day, and of course they
      
      
      
      came back upon me, as your things always do, with new meaning. The freedom, the large
      spaces you make all round one, fill me with continual delight. I begin to see more
      clearly the bearing of it all on Democracy: that thought surges up more &amp; more as
      the end &amp; direction of all your writings. I don't know whether it is so. But this
      immense change that is taking place is absorbing to me now, and your writings seem
      the only ones that come close to the great
      
      
      heart of it and make it a living thing to one with all its fierce passions &amp; contradictions
      and oceanic sort of life. I wish I could say what I mean. <u>But it is to thank you</u>. There is one thing that I never doubt for a moment—and that is your deepest relation
      to it all.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am very well &amp; happy. My term's work is over and I am going away for a month, to
      Cambridge &amp; to Brighton. I should like to describe to you
      
      
      the life of these great manufacturing towns like Sheffield. I think you would be surprised
      to see the squalor &amp; raggedness of them. Sheffield is finely situated, magnificent
      hill country all round about, and on the hills for miles &amp; miles (on one side of the
      town) elegant villa residences—and in the valley below one enduring cloud of smoke,
      and a pale faced teeming population, and tall chimneys and ash heaps covered with
      squalid children picking them over, and dirty alleys, and courts
      
      
      and houses half roofless, and a river running black through the midst of them. It
      is a strange &amp; wonderful sight. There is a great deal of distress just now—so many
      now being out of work—and it is impossible to pass through the streets without seeing
      it obvious in some form or other. (A man burst into floods of tears the other day
      when I gave him a bit of silver). But each individual is such a mere unit in the great
      crowd and
      
      
      they go and hide their misery away—easily enough.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0141b">1. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1042">2. Sydney Howard Vines
      (1849–1934) was among Edward Carpenter's circle of Whitman admirers in
      England. On November 13, Carpenter sent Whitman—in a letter now
      lost—Vines's request for books. On , Whitman sent the books (<em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and <em>Two Rivulets</em>) and a post card to Vines. Whitman also
      sent a letter to Carpenter on , noting,
      "have to-day mailed Mr Vines' books." At that time, Vines was Fellow and
      Lecturer in Botany at Christ's College, Cambridge, and later was named
      Sherardian Professor of Botany at Oxford. Vines's copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> inscribed by Whitman, "Sidney H. Vines from the
      author," was among the books offered for sale in the Spring 2001 catalog of
      Bertram Rota, Ltd., an antiquarian bookseller in London.<a href="#r2">[back]
