      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir, 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>You will be surprised perhaps to receive a note from one whose name even you do not
      know, but I have long had you down in my heart as one of my friends, and will tell
      you all about how I came to write to you now. Some time ago, Mrs. J. T. Trowbridge<sup><a href="#loc.00881_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> — who is a friend of yours too, I believe — gave me "Leaves of Grass" to read, and
      told me about you, and since then, I have never thought of you as a stranger. Last week I had a letter from my friend Miss M. E. Rice who
      is helping nurse the wounded soldiers in Armory Square Hospital. She told me you were
      often in the Hospital, and so today, after writing to her, I couldn't help keeping
      on, and enclosing a little note for you. But you mustn't think I wholly like your
      book. Often when I am reading it I take the words right home to my heart, and feel
      stronger and better for them, but sometimes, I am a little angry, and wish I had you
      by my side that I might tell you what I think and hear what you had to say in self-defense. But that [
      <span class="unclear">only?</span>]
       as we sometimes disagree with those we love best, you know, and I shouldn't be writing
      to you now if somehow or other the "Leaves of Grass" hadn't woven themselves into
      so fresh a garland in my mind as to make me wish to thank you for them. Now that the
      war is over, and peace is fast coming out of disorder and conflict, and there will
      be fewer sick and wounded soldiers to claim your time and care, I hope you will find
      new and still more beautiful "Leaves," for those of us who recognize and love their
      truth and beauty. In the meantime, don't be offended at the liberty I have taken in sending you this note. I am passionately fond
      of beauty in all its manifestations, but whoever gives me beautiful thoughts, is my
      friend forever, though I may never see his face, and this must be my excuse now. I
      hardly dare ask you, to send me a reply because I know, how fully your time must be
      occupied, but it would be very pleasant to have a few lines from you. Let that be
      just as you wish however, and believe me, 
   </p>
