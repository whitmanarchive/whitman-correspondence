      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been looking for you the last two days &amp; nights—but I have about given you
      up now. 
      I have been kept in pretty close, as we have had real winter here, snow &amp; bad weather,
      
      &amp; bad walking—I have been quite alone, as my brother &amp; sister went off to Delaware
      
      on Wednesday on a Christmas visit, to return to-morrow, Saturday—I am about the same—My
      strength still keeps quite 
      
      
      encouraging—I think is better than any time yet—my walking no better, &amp; still a good
      deal of distress in the head—but, as I said in my letter of Monday last,<sup><a href="#loc.01653_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> (did you get it Tuesday?)—I somehow feel a little more like myself 
      than any time since I was taken down—your last letter was quite a treat—so much about
      Washington, &amp; folks, one thing &amp; another—As I write I sit here in the parlor—we have
      had an awful time from the fire going out in the heater, &amp; making it up again—there
      is so much complicated machinery about one of these heaters with all the late improvements—give
      me my old stove &amp; wood fire yet—It is snowing by fits here this morning.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
