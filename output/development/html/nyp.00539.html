   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00539_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      Answ'd Feb 1, 1885 | Jan. 26 1885. It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving
      Service | Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Camden | Jan | (?) | 6 PM |
      1885(?) | N.J.; Washington, Rec'd. | Jan | 27 | 730 AM | 1885 | (?). O'Connor
      dated this post card correctly.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00539_n2">2. The <em>Springfield Republican</em> reprinted on January 24, from the New York <em>Mail and Express</em>, a jocular account by Henry Peterson in
      which he took exception to Whitman's descriptions of animals. Peterson was a
      friend of O'Connor (see the letters from O'Connor to Whitman of  and ).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00539_n3">3. Richard Maurice Bucke
      visited Whitman from December 2 to 5, and Burroughs joined them on December 4
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00539_n4">4. "Of That Blithe Throat of
      Thine" appeared in the January issue of <em>Harper's Monthly</em>.
      Whitman sent the poem to the magazine on October 17, 1884, and asked $30
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Henry M. Alden, the editor, rejected "After the
      Supper and Talk" on . "Washington's
      Monument, February, 1885" appeared as "Ah, Not This Granite, Dead and Cold" in
      the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> on February 22. "Death of General
      Grant," with the title "As One by One Withdraw the Lofty Actors," was sent on
      April 2 at the "request" of the editor of <em>Harper's Weekly</em>
      and was printed on May 16 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). It appeared as "Grant"
      in <em>The Critic</em> on August 15.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00539_n5">5. Whitman did not inform
      O'Connor of domestic details. On January 20 the Lays moved out of 328 Mickle
      Street, and on January 25 he began to have his breakfasts at the home of Mrs.
      Mary Davis at 412 West Street. For almost five weeks Whitman lived alone until
      Mrs. Davis became his housekeeper on February 24 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r5">[back]
