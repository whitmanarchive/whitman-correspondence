   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George M. Williamson was a New York
      book collector who contacted Whitman several times about purchasing manuscripts,
      and later published <em>Catalogue of A Collection of Books,
         Letters, and Manuscripts written by Walt Whitman, in the Library of George
         M. Williamson, Grand View on Hudson</em> (New York: The Marion Press, 1903).
      Other items in Williamson's collection, which was sold at auction in 1908,
      included George Washington's copy of <em>Don Quixote</em>, a
      presentation copy of Longfellow's "Evangeline," Hawthorne's annotated copy of
      <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, and "a very remarkable collection
      of Walt Whitman's works" (<em>The George M. Williamson
         Collection</em> [Anderson Galleries, Inc., 1908]).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04492_n1">1. After a later exchange with
      Williamson about purchasing manuscripts (see the letter from Williamson to
      Whitman of October 6, 1888), Whitman remarked to Horace Traubel: "I would like
      to humor Williamson but don't see how I can do it. He will have to content his
      'happy owner' soul with patience: I can give him no hope. That whole mania for
      collecting things strikes me as an evidence of disease—sometimes of
      disease in an acute form: though I know Williamson for an exceptional man in a
      bad crowd. And indeed, that is what makes a remarkable matter more
      remarkable—that a man such as we know Williamson to be should care a damn
      whether he was the happy owner of a manuscript—any manuscript—or
      not. Well, give him my love: that is real: and if he is satisfied to be the
      happy owner of my love he owns it—tell him so—and welcome, welcome"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      [1906–1996], 9 vols., 2:442). In 1891, however, Whitman sent Williamson
      manuscript drafts of several poems, including "Old Age's Ship and Crafty
      Death's" and "A Twilight Song."<a href="#r1">[back]
