      <br></br>Boston 
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Aug 17/60
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>  
   
   <p>You will accept our
      <u>hearty</u> thanks for your kindly advice about the S.P.—You can rely upon our keeping it secret<sup><a href="#loc.00578_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Perhaps Mr. Clapp told you of our offer to take it September 1st. We rec'd a letter
      to day from him stating he intended to visit us Monday or Tuesday to make some arrangement
      with us—if possible.
   </p>
   
   <p>Now as you have been so kind as to give us a valuable hint, will you please write
      us per return mail stating what you know of the affairs of the S.P.—that is if it
      can be done without trenching upon your friendly relations with Mr. Clapp? Is the
      paper in debt; if so to whom; are there any liabilities incurred, which would make
      it subject to attachment if sold to and owned by parties not formerly connected with
      it;—what are Mr. Howland's claims, and of what nature.<sup><a href="#loc.00578_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>  Does he help edit the paper? These questions are asked with a view to our being
      the sole owners of the Press with Mr. Clapp for editor.
   </p>
   
   <p>The tone of his letter indicates a determination to make a trade with us of <u>some</u> kind, and therefore we wish to have any statement of his affairs he may make corroborated
      by others. If you have no objections to answering our queries we would esteem it a
      favor to hear from you by <u>return mail</u>.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your suggestion as to our discerning the ownership and responsibilities of the paper
      we regard as the only practical thing that can be done, toward relieving Mr. C. from
      his difficulties. Of course we should not want it unless he was its <u>Editor</u> and we could be its <u>business</u> managers.  <u>We</u> can make it <u>pay</u> (we think) in a very short time—Beside we are deeply interested in sustaining any
      journal that dares in these days of literary flunkeyism to be independent, and make the literature of
      a country what it should be.
   </p>
   
   <p>Now if Mr. C. can obtain a business party to do the <u>business</u> of the paper, (T &amp; E or some other), what a flourishing paper could be got up. But
      T &amp; E do not want to be subjected to any liabilities connected with the past of the
      S.P. and therefore proceed with caution before operating.
   </p>
   
   <p>We wrote to Mr. C. some days ago making an offer, but now we shall act having in view
      your suggestion.
   </p>
   
   <p>About the L of G.—Our Mr. E. is in the country, to return tonight or tomorrow. He
      will write you at length about the Cheap Edition as he has it in charge<sup><a href="#loc.00578_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Will Mr. Clapp use the notice of L of G in the Cincinnati Daily Press?<sup><a href="#loc.00578_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> If not please re-mail it to us when you have done with it. We have heard of the "Dial"
      notice, but could not get a copy here. We have written to the Editor for a copy.<sup><a href="#loc.00578_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>
      <u>We</u> too wish you could be with us in Boston for we have <u>so</u> much to say; and our "fanatic" wants to get under the refreshing shelter of Walt's
      spirit; he does not ask Walt to talk, but only for the privilege of looking into those
      eyes of calm, and through them to enter into that soul, so deep in its emotions, so
      majestic in all its thought-movements, and yet so simple and childlike.<sup><a href="#loc.00578_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup> Yes, Walt Whitman: though men of the world and arch-critics do not <u>understand</u> thee, yet some there be among men and women who <u>love</u> thee and hold thy spirit close by their own.
   </p>
   
   <p><span class="indent">"Among the men and women, the multitude, I perceive are picking me out by secret and
         divine signs—</span><br>
      <span class="indent">* * * *</span><br> 
      <span class="indent">Some are baffled—But that one is not—that one knows me."<sup><a href="#loc.00578_n8" id="r7">7</a></sup>
         </span><br></p>
   
   <p>And so Dear Walt, would we love to seek you and learn to know you. And have we not known you?—</p>
   
   <p>We will try the Smithsonian House when we are obliged to represent the "Hub" in Gotham.
      Either Mr E or T will be in New York soon on business and will then see you, unless
      that you first come to Boston. Frank regretted his missing you. Perhaps the miss in
      this case <u>was</u> a mile.
   </p>
   
   <p>We do not care one single damn for the Miss Nancys of Bookdom but shall continue to
      publish and <u>sell</u> Leaves of Grass "so long" as Walt will have us.

   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Dear Walt,  I wrote you in the name of T &amp; E a longer letter than I intended. Somehow
      I could not stop. I felt such a wondrous geniality, that I enjoyed looking at your
      handwriting and imagined you were before me instead of the letter.
   </p>
   
   <p>My dear little wife wants to write you a letter, and will when the domestic gods are
      propitious, so that she can talk with the great Poet as she would like. She has had
      much ill health, but is now much better.
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish you could visit our home. The country is delightful. You would laugh and grow
      fat to see our blessed Jamaica Plain, and enjoy its beauties.—Come and see us if you
      can.
   </p>
   
   <p>There now, some business comes in that I must attend to so I close</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thayer and Eldridge was
      the Boston publishing firm responsible for the third edition of Walt Whitman's
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00578_n2">1. Thayer and Eldridge sought
      Whitman's advice on the prospect of purchasing Henry Clapp, Jr.,'s <em>New-York Saturday Press</em>, which Clapp founded in 1858.
      Whitman and Clapp most likely met in Charles Pfaff's beer cellar, located in
      lower Manhattan. The <em>Saturday Press</em> was instrumental in
      promoting Whitman's poetry and celebrity; over twenty items on Whitman appeared
      in the <em>Press</em> before the periodical folded in 1860.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00578_n3">2. Edward Howland was a
      journalist, essayist and reformer. Howland helped back Clapp financially when he
      founded the <em>Saturday Press</em> in 1858.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00578_n4">3. Whitman and Thayer and
      Eldridge contemplated issuing a "Cheap Edition" of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> for $1; with the proposed release of this cheaper <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, the price of the "fine" edition would be
      raised from $1.25 to $1.50.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00578_n5">4. The <em>Cincinnati Daily Press</em> was a
      daily Ohio newspaper published by Henry Reed from 1860 to 1862 (formerly the <em>Penny Press</em>).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00578_n6">5. Thayer and Eldridge refer to
      an August 1860 article in the <em>Dial</em>.
      <a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00578_n7">6. In an , letter to Whitman, Thayer calls
      himself "your old 'fanatic.'" Thayer's allusion to "our 'fanatic'" in this
      August 1860 letter most likely refers to himself.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00578_n8">7. The lines Thayer cites (with
      the exception of one error) appear in the 1860 <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> as "Calamus 41."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
