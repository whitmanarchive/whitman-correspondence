   <p>Worse and worse! Rained all last night and has rained pouring all day, still coming

      that he considers you better. Guess you will have to turn Ed. Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r4">4</a></sup> out once a day for a good long walk (whenever you can best
      spare him) I judge from what you say that he is suffering from being too closely
      confined and from not having enough to do. If he c<u>d</u> get a
      cord of wood a day to saw (and would saw it) I would guarantee him against heartburn

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07290_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey U.S.A. It is postmarked:
      London | PM | JA 9 | 89 | Canada; Camden N.J. | JAN | 11 | 6 AM | [illegible] | Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n4144">3. Dr. Walsh was the brother of
      William S. Walsh (1854–1919), an American author and editor of <em>Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</em>. Richard Maurice Bucke
      arranged to have him accompany Dr. William Osler to see Whitman, since Bucke
      believed it would be useful to have a younger doctor examine the poet. See
      Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.35.html">Wednesday, December 5, 1888</a>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">4. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.07562_n3">6. Whitman's poem "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00006.html">My 71st Year</a>" was published in <em>Century Illustrated
         Magazine</em> in November 1889.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n6000">8. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
