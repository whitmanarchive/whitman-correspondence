   <p>The weather remains serene. A charming hazy, cloudy, windy, autumn day. I am trying
      to get on with my annual report but it moves slowly—however I have time and I
      shall no doubt come out of it as usual in due course. All looks well with the meter,<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      we had a first class business man &amp; capitalist to see it this week. We offered
      him a share with us for a certain sum, and for the benefit of his advice and
      assistance. He consider'd the meter such a big thing that he proposed to associate
      a
      more active business man still than  himself and a man with more capital and more access to the great
      money centres. He has written to this man to come up from Montreal to look into the
      matter. I think it quite likely we may all make all the money we want out of it.

   <p>How are things with you and the new vols? I hope to have a copy of the "Complete
      Works"<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r3">3</a></sup> very soon now—the "N.B."<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r4">4</a></sup> in its new dress will be heartily welcome
      too
   </p>
   
   <p>Has Osler<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r5">5</a></sup> been over to see you yet? He must be back in Phila by
      now?
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you are not suffering too much—I know well you are not having a good
      time. But I am <u>sure</u> it will be all right at last

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: LONDON | PM | SP 19 | 88 | CANADA; CAMDEN, N.J. | SEP | 21 | 6AM

   <p id="loc.07230_n2">2. Bucke and his brother-in-law
      William John Gurd were designing a gas and fluid meter to be patented in Canada
      and sold in England.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">3. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n3999">4. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n4302">5. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on
      Osler, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitman-dev.unl.edu/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_202.html">Osler, Dr. William (1849–1919)</a>," <em>Walt
