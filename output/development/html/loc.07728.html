   <p>My thorn first writes me a scrawl saying she had a pleasant call on you.  After receiving
      in (once somewhat melancholy card saying that "they all came" in on you, preachers &amp; all,
      I felt rather sorry I asked her to go. But I'm glad she did. She visits always in
      Philad. at house of her friend Mrs. Leslie Miller. 'Lel' the Husband runs a city school
      of design up there near Girard College, or nearer the synagogue on Broad St. Well
      he used to be a progressive man when young &amp; in Boston, wore slouch hats, <u>long hair </u>&amp; read Whitman. But he has grown contempibly conforming, conventional, since going
      to Philad, married, &amp; 2 child<u>n</u>.  He drew those pictures of yr home for my book; but takes the blackguard view of
      you. My dame laid him out flat after calling on you. She can do such things, is keen
      as steel. She writes me he will never mention you again to her.  He told me once (he
      is realy good fellow at heart) that he actually saw you in a livery stable, several
      times!!!  I wanted to ask him if that was not the place for an artistling to be occasionally,
      too, &amp; and if Rosa Bonheur &amp; Meissonier wd n't be apt to be seen a great deal in liver stables.
   </p>
   
   <p>When a poor librarian 'tother day thrust that gigantic snob R.G. White's pitiful perody of L of G. in my face &amp; thot he had floord me, he said he ahd heard that Edwin Arnold
      had been calling on you &amp; tried again to like L. of G. &amp;— <u>could</u>n't—aw!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
