   <p>Excuse the delay—I have rec'd the draft for 10 pounds, 10 shillings, &amp; have
      drawn the money. As I understand it, the plan is to make a selection from my Poems
      &amp; put them in a Volume of your "Canterbury" series, to be called <u>Walt</u>
      <u>Whitman's</u>
      <u>Poems</u>,—you to select—&amp; perhaps to write
      Preface or Biographical notice, or what not—I am willing—on the sole
      &amp; specific condition that it is not to come for sale to this country, without
      further &amp; written permission from me.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="pri.00009_n1">2. Ernest Rhys
      (1859–1946) wrote on : "Let me
      say simply in a young man's way to you who are an old man now, how dearly and
      earnestly I think of you across the sea to-night, remembering the Past, looking
      on to the great to-morrow, for perhaps of all young men you have helped me most
      powerfully &amp; perfectly." On  Rhys
      proposed a one-shilling edition of Whitman's poetry in <em>The
         Canterbury Poets</em> series. On  Rhys wrote for the third time after waiting "for a reply
      so far in vain," and included the payment from Walter Scott, the English
      publisher of <em>The Canterbury Poets</em>. On Rhys's letter
      Whitman wrote: "the little English selection from L. of G. is out since, &amp;
      the whole edition (10,000) sold." For more information about Rhys, see Joel
      Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
