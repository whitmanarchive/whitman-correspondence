      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been out halting around for a walk, as it is quite pleasant today—But I believe
      
      I have overdone the matter, as I have a pretty bad feeling the last hour or two both
      
      in the head &amp; left side,—&amp; as I sit here writing,—So your <u>limited express</u> seems to be 
      a real success—if it keeps up as well as it has begun I have no doubt it will increase,
      
      &amp; be patronised, &amp; become a permanent institution—(I had got the idea, somehow, at
      first, 
      that the same crew went <u>through</u> from Wash. to New York, &amp; so was some 
      in hopes of seeing you in Philadelphia)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>No change in my condition or prospects—the young man, Walter Godey, still works as
      my substitute 
      in the Solicitor's office—I havn't had any word from Eldridge in two months, nor from Mrs. O'Connor 
      in some time—(have you been up there?) Do you see Hinton or Tasistro?—My sister has
      just called me to my dinner—so I will close for this time.
      
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01631_n1">1. This and the letter from
      Whitman to Ellen M. O'Connor of , were
      obviously written on the same day. The allusion to the Ashtons, who had recently
      lost a child (see the letter from Whitman to Doyle of ), conclusively establishes the year.<a href="#r1">[back]
