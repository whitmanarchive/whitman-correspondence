      No copies of the <em>Citizen</em> are extant before July 10,
      1869; it is not known precisely when "A Carol of Harvest for 1867" was
      reprinted. (William Livingston Alden, associate editor of the New York <em>Citizen</em>, wrote to Whitman on , , and . Whitman also corresponded
      with Alden on , in reference to
      another piece.) <br><br>
      "A Carol of Harvest for 1867," first appeared in the <em>Galaxy</em>. On August 1, 1867, William Conant Church, from the office
      of the <em>Galaxy</em>, wrote to O'Connor: "It seems to me
      that this glorious harvest of 1867, sown &amp; reaped by the returned
      soldiers, ought to be sung in verse.…Walt Whitman is the man to chaunt
      the song. Will you not ask him to do it for The Galaxy?" (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.). The editors, in a letter to Walt Whitman on
      , considered "A Carol of
      Harvest, for 1867" (later titled "The Return of the Heroes") "to rank with
      the very best of your poems." For images and a transcription of "A Carol of
      Harvest, for 1867" as it appeared in the September 1867 edition of the <em>Galaxy</em>, see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00192.html">"A Carol of Harvest, for 1867"</a>.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00276_n3">2. There are extant no
      letters from Walt Whitman to his family for the latter part of the year, though,
      as "A Check list of Whitman's Letters" makes clear, he wrote frequently. There
      were no startling developments. While Jeff was in St. Louis, Martha lived with
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, and her children ("the young fry department," as Walt
      Whitman's mother termed them on )
      continued to annoy their grandmother. George spent some time in Philadelphia in
      November on a job that Moses Lane evidently had obtained for him; for Lane, see
      Whitman's  letter to Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman. Jeff returned to Brooklyn in December, and, on , Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      reported that Jeff was taking his family to St. Louis.<a href="#r2">[back]
