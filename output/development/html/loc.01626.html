      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I felt bad enough to hear of the death of Bill Barnes<sup><a href="#loc.01626_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—&amp; in such a sudden, cruel way—poor young man—he has had a reckless unsatisfactory
      life—many deficiencies &amp; very shiftless—all of which I understood perfectly well—but
      I had an affection for him after all—Have I not heard that he had a wife &amp; child?
      which, (if so,) he has left—but was parted from quite a while ago—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Pete, so your shirts came all safe, &amp; they fit you, do they?—good—The blue shirt
      (did I write?) is to wear <u>over</u>, loose—it is made large for that purpose—I like the looks of them, the blue shirt
      collar turned down low with a nice black 
      silk neck handkerchief, tied loose—over a clean white shirt without necktie—I think
      they are very becoming to young working-men—I sent 3 Graphics to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nash—when
      you hear, tell me if they came safe.—I send you some papers to-day—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—There is nothing new with me, or my condition—My principal malady is about the same,
      
      (no worse)—but I have had for three or four days a wretched cold in the head, 
      sore throat, most lost my voice for two days—every thing bad enough—am better rather
      to-day, begin to speak so I can be understood—shall be all right soon—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—As I write, it is now between 11 and 12 a.m. Friday—it is very mild, sunshiny forenoon—I
      am sitting here in the parlor,—looks south, looks down a pleasant street, West street,
      
      full view, makes quite a nice view for me to sit &amp; look out—the letter carrier 
      comes around in about an hour from now, &amp; takes my letters to P.O.—I have become sort of acquainted with most of the carriers, ferry men, 
      car conductors &amp; drivers, &amp;c. &amp;c.—they are very good indeed—help me on &amp; off the cars,
      here &amp; in Philadelphia—they are nearly all young fellows—it all help along—Well Pete, dear loving boy, I will bid you good bye for this week.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
