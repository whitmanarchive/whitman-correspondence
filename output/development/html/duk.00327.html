   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00327_n100">1. The letterhead of the
      stationery used in this letter presents a sketch of a Union Soldier standing at
      attention and holding a rifle over his left shoulder. Beside him stands the
      Union banner and behind him is a military camp. The words "<em>On
         Guard</em>" are printed beneath. In the letter Whitman speaks briefly of the
      battles of South Mountain (September 14, 1862 to September 15, 1862) and
      Antietam (September 17, 1862).<a href="#r1">[back]
