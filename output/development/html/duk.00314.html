      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I wrote you last when we 
      arived
      
       at Hateras Inlet nearly a month since but 
      dont
      
       know as you received it as I hear the 
      leters
      
       did not leave there 
      untill
      
       we left to come here, which was on Wednesday last, &nbsp;this island is on
      Palmico<sup><a href="#duk.00314_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Sound about 45 miles from Hateras and is about 12
      miles long and 4 wide &nbsp;we left Hateras with a fleet of about 70 vessels &nbsp;only 15 or
      16
      of which was fighting crafts &nbsp;the rest were tow boats old steamboats and schooners,
      &nbsp;we
      had about 13000 Infantry on board the transports and came to anchor near hear on
      Thursday afternoon &nbsp;on Friday Morning we got under way &nbsp;the gunboats taking the lead
      and
      as soon as we got within range the gunboats opened fire on the Batteries on the shore
      here, and they blazed away back, it was a fine sight &nbsp;the shells bursting all around
      the
      batteries and sending up a column of sand 20 feet high and the Batteries throwing
      shot
      and shells like blazes &nbsp;the Staten Island Ferry boat Hunchback which had some heavy
      guns
      on board was shot through and through but she anchored and stuck to it like a good
      fellow &nbsp;they kept it up 
      untill
      
       dusk and then hauled off for the night About 5 O Clock in the afternoon our
      regiment landed &nbsp;one of the gunboats throwing shell to cover us &nbsp;one of the Mass 
      regts
      
       landing just about the same time, we were on 
      boad
      
       of an old stern wheel steamboat which took us up so close that we jumped on
      shore &nbsp;we had to wade about 200 yards through mud and water up to our knees and then
      found a spot not very dry but we 
      stoped
      
       there for the night &nbsp;we built fires and tried to dry ourselves as well as we
      could &nbsp;took our supers of hard crackers and then laid down for the night. About 11
      O
      Clock it 
      comenced
      
       to rain not very hard but enough to make it very unpleasant &nbsp;I stuck it out
      until my blanket got wet through, and then got up and stood around the fire until
      morning &nbsp;we had breakfast of good crackers, put more crackers in our haversacks and
      then
      fell in for a march &nbsp;we moved off in two Brigades &nbsp;we being the second numbering all
      told about 7000 men with a battery of 5 howitzers &nbsp;we struck directly into the woods
      and
      soon heard the firing 
      comenced
      
       on the right of the first Brigade &nbsp;we were in a wagon path and all around us
      was a thick wood
      almost as thick as the woods around Deer Park<sup><a href="#duk.00314_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &nbsp;we kept on,
      the first Brigade driving the enemy 
      untill
      
       we got into a thick swamp where the mud and water was over the top of my boots
      and the bushes was so thick that we had the greatest difficulty in getting through
      &nbsp;we
      kept on however 
      untill
      
       we drove them chock into their 
      Batery
      
       which was one of the 
      celabrated
      
       masked 
      Bateries
      
       we have heard so 
      mutch
      
       about &nbsp;our regiment worked around on their right flank through a thicket that
      you would think it was 
      imposible
      
       for a man to pass through &nbsp;it was might trying to a fellows nerves as the
      balls was flying around pretty thick &nbsp;cutting the twigs off overhead and knocking
      the
      bark off the trees all around us, but our regiment behaved finely and pressed on as
      fast
      as possible &nbsp;we were under fire about an hour and a half before our regiment dare
      fire a
      shot for fear of shooting our own friends as we could not see 10 yards on either side.
      As soon as our 
      regt
      
       got sight of the 
      Batery
      
       Gen Renno<sup><a href="#duk.00314_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> who is our Brigadeer General gave the
      order to charge and away we went &nbsp;the water flying over our heads as we splashed through
      it &nbsp;I was in my position on the left flank of our 
      regt
      
       when I
      heard the order to charge so that when I reached the Battery our colors and the flag
      of
      the 9th New York and the 21st Mass were planted there &nbsp;ours were there first however
      but
      it was mighty tight between us and the others &nbsp;when the other 
      regts
      
       came in you can bet there was some tall shouting &nbsp;but there was nary a rebel
      in sight for as soon as they saw us start on a charge they started to run, one of
      the
      rebels lay there dead by his gun &nbsp;another lay badly wounded &nbsp;a few feet further in
      the
      bushes lay an old man with beard perfectly white, dead, here and there heaps of
      knapsacks haversacks and clothes guns and 
      amunition
      
       &nbsp;I picked up this paper and envelope inside the Battery and as I wanted a pair
      of drawers I found a new pair and a lot of hankerchiefs which I lost again &nbsp;we soon
      formed again and started after the rebels &nbsp;quite a number of 
      whome
      
       had broke for the shore about a mile off &nbsp;the way was pretty well strewn with
      blankets an coats thrown off by the rebels as they ran. a few of them escaped in boats
      but we got 40 or 50 there &nbsp;among the rest was Mr. O Jennings Wise<sup><a href="#duk.00314_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> son of Gov Wise of Virginia who was badly wounded and I
      believe 
      dided
      
       to day. he came to the Island yesterday morning with 600 of the noted Wise
      Legion &nbsp;he was a fine looking young fellow and plucky, we took these prisoners to
      a
      house near by and started off in the woods to look for more game and we found it,
      &nbsp;after
      traveling about an hour we found two dead rebels lying in the woods and farther on
      lay
      another just dying &nbsp;the top of his head being shot off &nbsp;a little way from these we
      met a
      dozen rebels with a white flag &nbsp;we took care of them and soon met another party with
      a
      flag &nbsp;they said they came from a large force and wanted to make terms for a 
      surender
      
       &nbsp;our general told them 
      unles
      
       they made an unconditional 
      surender
      
       at once he would order his forces to fire but they had had enough for one day
      and stacked their arms and wilted without a 
      strugle
      
       &nbsp;they numbered about 1600 men and had cleared a space of a couple of hundred
      acres of land in the woods and erected splendid barracks for I should think 20,000
      men
      &nbsp;the buildings have floors and fire places and shingle roofs &nbsp;I have not counted the
      buildings but should think there was 75 or 80 &nbsp;some 25 or 30 of which are about 100
      feet
      by 50 and a good many first rate log houses and a large hospital Building &nbsp;quite a
      quantity of stores were found in some of the buildings consisting of bacon, rice,
      crackers &nbsp;all of which we took 
      peacable
      
      
      
      posession
      
       of and we have slaughtered hogs enough in the woods to keep us all in fresh
      pork last night and today with a small stock for tomorrow &nbsp;we are living now like
      fighting cocks and prisoners have been 
      comeing
      
       in and giving 
      themselvs
      
       up and squads of them have been taken by our pickets all day so that we must
      have some 2500 to night &nbsp;I have seen 1 or 2 Colonels and lots of captain and other
      Officers among them &nbsp;they have been working here the prisoners say for the last 5
      months 
      puting
      
       up these buildings and I give them credit for 
      haveing
      
       built tip top quarters &nbsp;the loss of our regiment was remarkable small &nbsp;I think not
      over 10 killed and 10 or 12 wounded &nbsp;I think the loss on our side not more than 40
      killed and 70 or 80 wounded &nbsp;it is a miracle to me that our loss was so small when
      I
      think how the bullets 
      wized
      
       around our heads. The enemy had a great advantage in knowing the ground and
      could pick his position while we had to follow without knowing were we were going
      &nbsp;they
      thought they would tole us up to the 
      Bateries
      
       and then slaughter us as they did at Bethell<sup><a href="#duk.00314_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &nbsp;they
      say they did not think we would go in that water and fight &nbsp;the 
      Batery
      
       was made of turf and had 4 guns &nbsp;we 
      whiped
      
       them fair and square on their own ground and they say we are a good deal
      smarter than they thought we were. It was rather a sickening sight to see the wounded
      brought along the road but I expected sutch things so that it did not effect me mutch
      and after a while we would pass them lying in the bushes and think nothing of it &nbsp;I
      was
      as calm and cool during the whole affair as I am at any time and I was perfectly
      surprised to see how well our troops acted &nbsp;our Generals too Renno and Foster<sup><a href="#duk.00314_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> acted first rate &nbsp;Burnside<sup><a href="#duk.00314_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> and
      Pratt<sup><a href="#duk.00314_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> I believe was not on shore &nbsp;they were atending to
      the forts on shore &nbsp;Pratts Brigade I believe did not land 
      untill
      
       the fleet silenced some of the 
      Bateries
      
       &nbsp;the fleet went to work yesterday morning about the same time that we&nbsp;did
      &nbsp;knocked tar out of some of the Batteries on the shore and scared the rebels so that
      they left others before the fleet fired a shot into them &nbsp;I went down to one of their
      Batteries this afternoon and was surprised to see how large and well 
      aranged
      
       it was &nbsp;it was made of turf &nbsp;the parapet which shields the 
      guners
      
       being about 15 ft thick and 8 or 9 feet high with embrasures to rain the guns
      out &nbsp;it mounted 10 guns &nbsp;2 of them being 32 pound Parrot guns rifled and the others
      heavy 
      smoothe
      
       bore guns &nbsp;I could see from there three other Forts &nbsp;one they say just like
      the one I was in &nbsp;another 
      mutch
      
       larger and mounting 18 large guns and I believe there are some others that I
      have not seen &nbsp;some of them were silenced by the fleet and I 
      supose
      
      
      they it was no use to
      try to hold the others as we were in the rear of them and we would have been at them
      if
      they had staid. &nbsp;So Mammy I think we done a pretty good days work yesterday marching
      15
      or 16 miles and fighting with boots filed with water for 4 hours. &nbsp;
      Wel
      
       Mammy how are you all and whats the news &nbsp;are you and Mat and the baby and all
      the rest 
      wel
      
       &nbsp;write to me as soon as ever you can and tell me all the news &nbsp;I wish Walt if
      he is home, or Jeff would send me some papers &nbsp;often it is a great treat to get a
      sight

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00314_n100">1. Completing one hundred
      days' military duty, the men of the Thirteenth Regiment were mustered out of
      service on August 6, 1861. More than half of them, however, joined other
      military units being formed when the war appeared to be far from over. On
      September 18, 1861, George Whitman re-enlisted as a private in the Fifty-First
      Regiment of New York Volunteers (known as the Shepard Rifles) for a period of
      three years. The next day Whitman was promoted to the rank of sergeant major by
      Colonel Edward Ferrero, the regiment's first commanding officer. About October
      29, 1861, Whitman's regiment left New York for training duty at Annapolis,
      Maryland. While there Whitman became ill and had to spend a few weeks
      recuperating at a private residence in the area. On January 6, 1862, not long
      after Whitman's return to his regiment, the Fifty-First Regiment, as a part of
      the Burnside Expedition, sailed for Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The objective
      of this land-sea expedition was to capture certain Confederate positions on the
      coast of North Carolina. The chief results of the campaign were the seizures of
      Roanoke Island, New Bern, and Fort Macon. The expedition reached Fort Monroe on
      January 10, 1862, and Hatteras Inlet about the middle of the same month. After
      some two weeks of weighing anchor there waiting for the rest of the Union
      vessels to arrive and for the weather to improve, Burnside's troops attacked the
      Confederate forces at Roanoke Island on February 7, 1862. In this, the first
      extant letter written after the time of his re-enlistment, George Whitman
      describes the first of many battles he was to survive throughout the Civil
      War.<a href="#r1">[back]
