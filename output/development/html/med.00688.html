   </p>
   
   
   <p>What could you do, towards helping me in the matter by these two pages?—badly copied,
      but I can't write them out—I have sent duplicates of the two pp to Watson Gilder<sup><a href="#sjs.00012_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; said I requested you to see him soon as convenient.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am ab't as usual, except the locomotion business is worse, making a bad drawback, rendering
      me indeed at times practically helpless. I rec'd your letter—I thought Stedman's article full as good as could be expected<sup><a href="#sjs.00012_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Marvin call'd here yesterday, but I was absent &amp; didn't see him—

   <p id="sjs.00012_n1">2. Burroughs on November 2,
      1880, informed Whitman of Stedman's difficulties in getting his article printed
      in <em>Scribner's Monthly</em> over the objections of Holland, the
      editor, and observed: "The article is candid &amp; respectful &amp; that is all
      we can ask. . . . it seems to me that the adverse criticisms in the paper are
      all weak &amp; ineffectual, &amp; that he is truly at home only when he is
      appreciative. How gingerly he does walk at times to be sure, as if he feared the
      ground underfoot was mined" (T.E. Hanley Collection, University of Texas).
      Interestingly, Whitman did not comment on the following passage in Burroughs's
      letter: "Dr Bucke is a good fellow, but between me &amp; you, I am a little shy
      of him: I fear he lacks balance &amp; proportion &amp; that his book will not be
      pitched in the right key. But I hope I do him injustice."<a href="#r2">[back]
