   <p>It is the <em>same publishing</em>, only under a different name. The
      man who runs Rees Welsh's business, (the chief mate of the ship) and who first
      proposed &amp; put through the bargain last June with me—<em>David McKay</em>—has formally 
      bo't
      
       out &amp; assumed R W's miscellaneous &amp; publishing &amp; secondhand
      books business—&amp; is now &amp; henceforth the publisher of 
      L of G
      
       and 
      S D—drops into Rees Welsh's shoes—It is just as well—&amp; is
      indeed to me <em>no</em> change—for really my doings have been
      with 
      McK
      
       all along from the beginning<sup><a href="#nyp.00453_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—S. D.
      
       sales <em>rather</em> sluggish—(1500 were printed,
      towards 400 remain on the shelves in 23 Ninth St.)<sup><a href="#nyp.00453_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have 
      rec'd
      
       a long letter from Ezra H Heywood—dated Princeton, 
      Mass:<sup><a href="#nyp.00453_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Heywood has been arrested by
      Comstock—part at least of the <em>cause</em> appears to be
      sending printed slips by mail with "to a common prostitute" and "a woman waits for
      me"—supplements to Heywood's paper "the Word"—(I believe I will just
      enclose H's letter—slips &amp; all)—My impression is that <em>Comstock's chief object is to get, (by snap judgment probably) a
         judicial decision on which he can base a show to go before the P. M.
         General</em>, (as per the late decision of P.M.G. in such questions)—the
      hearing is to come off before U.S. Commissioner Hallett in Boston, Nov 16—(As
      to the vehement action of the Free religious &amp; lover folk, in their conventions,
      papers &amp;c in my favor—and even proceedings like these of Heywood—I
      see nothing better for myself or friends to do than quietly stand aside &amp; let it
      go on)—what do you think?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I write, it is a cloudy moist warmish Sunday, 10¼ a. m. pleasant—quiet
      here—I am up in my 3d story, south-front room, writing this—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is a long &amp; supercilious notice of 
      S. D.
      
       in 
      N. Y.
      
       World, Oct 30, I wonder if written by Hurlbert<sup><a href="#nyp.00453_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      himself?—an emanation of that New York nest of little malignants, (Stoddard,
      little Winter, and half a dozen more)—The Boston Herald some weeks since (Oct:
      15) had a lengthy and very warm notice, very judicious extracts (Sylvanus Baxter,
      author)<sup><a href="#nyp.00453_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup>—the best I have seen from the book's
      own standpoint (which of course is every thing)—Are you then going to make a
      brochure of the Tribune letters?<sup><a href="#nyp.00453_n6" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      <em>Good</em>, if so—Shall I furnish you with more detailed and
      verbatim data of the Osgood transaction &amp; correspondence—or have you them
      sufficiently?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Where is Ashton?<sup><a href="#nyp.00453_n7" id="r8">8</a></sup> Is he there in W. &amp; do you see him?
      If so tell him I have not forgotten him—&amp; that I send him &amp; Mrs. A. my
      love—In a late note I 
      ask'd
      
       you, if eligible, to send me Charley Eldridge's address<sup><a href="#nyp.00453_n8" id="r9">9</a></sup>—☛ Do you know what <em>ducks
         &amp; drakes</em> are? Well, 
      S. D.
      
       is a rapid skimming over the pond-surface of my life, thoughts,
      experiences, that way—the real area altogether 
      untouch'd, but the flat pebble making a few dips as it flies &amp; flits
      along—enough at least to give some living touches and
      contact-points—I was quite willing to make an immensely <em>negative</em> book.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am holding my own in the recovery of my <em>half state</em> of
      health—am contemplating some change of base, (residence,
      domicile—sometimes I have thought of coming to Washington, settling there,
      getting a lot &amp; small house in fee simple)<sup><a href="#nyp.00453_n9" id="r10">10</a></sup>—Have you sent Dowden's letter to Dr Bucke? I got a letter from Dr
      Channing<sup><a href="#nyp.00453_n10" id="r11">11</a></sup> asking me to lecture in the Tilton
      sisters'<sup><a href="#nyp.00453_n11" id="r12">12</a></sup> course this winter in Boston—but I
      cannot lecture at present—besides I shall certainly not do any thing to
      identify myself specially with free love<sup><a href="#nyp.00453_n12" id="r13">13</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00453_n13">1. This letter is addressed:
      Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service Bureau | Treasury | Washington | D C. It is
      postmarked: Camden | (?) | 12 | 6 PM | N.J.; Washington, Recd. | Nov | 13 | 430
      AM | 1882 | 2.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00453_n1">2. See the letter from
      Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00453_n2">3. Whitman constantly gave
      out erroneous figures. Only 1,000 copies of <em>Specimen Days</em>
      were printed in 1882 (see Whitman's letter to Anne Gilchrist of ). On December 1, 925 copies had
      been sold. Yet <em>The Critic</em> reported on October 21 that the
      book had been sold out before publication.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00453_n3">4. Heywood's letter was
      published as "An Open Letter to Walt Whitman" in a broadside distributed by
      <em>The Word</em> (copy in Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). Heywood informed Whitman that Benjamin R. Tucker, editor
      of the Boston <em>Globe</em>, was openly advertising <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in defiance of the post office. On
      the last page of Heywood's letter, which was sent to O'Connor, Whitman
      wrote: "I don't want this back again—Have you any thing to
      Suggest?—the more I think of it, the more I am convinced that is
      Comstock's game, (<em>see my letter</em>)" (Henry W. and
      Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library).<br><br>
      With this letter Whitman enclosed <em>The Truth Seeker</em> of
      November 4, "Whispers of Heavenly Death," and "Talks with Trelawney," dated
      August 4, who was quoted as finding in <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> "the material of poetry, but not poetry itself" (Berg).
      Mounted in the lower corner of Whitman's letter is a newspaper advertisement
      of Miss Leslie Hinton's appearance in <em>Little
         Sunshine</em>.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00453_n4">5. William Henry Hurlbert
      (1827–1895) was editor of the New York <em>World</em> from
      1876 to 1883. The review of <em>Specimen Days</em> in the
      newspaper began: "So painfully impressed is Mr. Whitman with the idea that every
      deed and experience of a man's life, nay, every sight and sound and touch and
      taste and smell, should be recorded that it is strange he has not sooner written
      his autobiography." Yet the <em>World</em> had printed on June 4,
      during the Boston fracas, some highly sympathetic reminiscences of Whitman by
      Thomas A. Gere, reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke, <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883], 32–34.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00453_n5">6. For Whitman's
      contributions to Baxter's review, see the letter from Whitman to Baxter of .<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00453_n6">7. O'Connor also planned
      to include <em>The Good Gray Poet</em>; see Bucke's letter to
      O'Connor, dated August 4 (The Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
      According to Bucke's letter to O'Connor on October 14, the latter decided
      not to reprint his pamphlet (The Library of Congress). On March 21, 1883,
      O'Connor explained to Burroughs that the project had been delayed because of
      "my cares and griefs."<br><br>
      O'Connor's third letter to the New York <em>Tribune</em> on the
      Boston censorship was refused by Reid; if possible, it was more choleric and
      longwinded than his published communications (see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New
      York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931], 226–231). Apparently O'Connor forgave
      the editor of the <em>Tribune</em>, for, in replying to
      O'Connor on October 14, Bucke wrote: "I think as you do that Reid did well
      by you and that we should be satisfied" (The Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00453_n7">8. J. Hubley Ashton was
      Assistant Attorney General when Whitman was employed in that office.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00453_n8">9. On  O'Connor gave Eldridge's address as the
      Internal Revenue Service Office in Boston.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00453_n9">10. On November 9 Whitman
      sold his lot at 460 Royden Street for $525 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Feinberg
      Collection).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00453_n10">11. O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, Dr. William F. Channing (see the letter from Whitman to Ellen M.
      O'Connor of ). According to
      O'Connor's letter to Whitman on , Channing
      had offered to reprint at his own expense <em>The Good Gray
         Poet</em> (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906], 1:54).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00453_n11">12. According to Heywood's
      letter to Whitman on November 5, Josephine S. Tilton, "the persistent Socialist,
      once imprisoned for her Faith," was selling copies of <em>Leaves
         of Grass</em> on the streets of Boston.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00453_n12">13. On May 28 and 29, the
      Free Love League adopted the following resolution: "That effort to suppress Walt
      Whitman's poems for their alleged obscenity, because officious exponents of 'law
      and order' lack wit to understand them, shows the continued lascivious stupidity
      voiced by pulpits and courts, the religio-political lewdness still mistaken for
      culture and purity . . ." (Boston Public Library; Roger Asselineau, <em>L'évolution de Walt Whitman</em> [Paris: Didier, 1954],
      252n).<a href="#r13">[back]
