      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sirs
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of 10th just rec'd<sup><a href="#upa.00207_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—If you desire to cease to
      be the publishers of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> unless I make the
      excisions required by the District Attorney—if this is your settled
      decision—I see indeed no other way than "some reasonable arrangement for
      turning the plates over" to me—What is the 
      am't
      
       of royalty due me, according
      to contract, from the sales altogether? &amp; what is your valuation of the
      plates?
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00207_n1">1. Osgood &amp; Co. wrote to
      Whitman on : "We have laid before the
      District Attorney the alterations proposed by you. They are not satisfactory. .
      . . As we said at the outset we do not wish to go into court in connection with
      this case. Therefore as your views seem to be irreconcilable with those of the
      official authorities there seems no alternative for us but to decline to further
      circulate the book. We should be open to any reasonable arrangement for turning
      the plates over to you." On  the publisher
      informed Whitman that the royalty due him was $405.50 and that the cost of the
      plates was $475. In return for a receipt for the royalty, the firm was willing
      to turn over to Whitman the plates, the steel portrait and 225 copies of the
      book in sheets. As Whitman did not reply, the firm wrote again on . The poet arranged better terms in the final
      settlement (see the letter from Whitman to Osgood &amp; Company of ).<a href="#r1">[back]
