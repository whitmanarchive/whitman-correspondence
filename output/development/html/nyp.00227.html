   </p>
   
   <p>I answered your letter koughnsiquenlighly<sup><a href="#nyp.00227_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> you owe me one, unless you think that sending a fellow some note paper would be sufficient
      answer. I had several thoughs then, one was that I made such a poor fish at it, that you wanted me to try over
      again and see if I could not do better and then I thought that you had had some <em>milk</em> in your coffee which had been so strong that you imagined you had said something.
      there is something I am certain of and that is, a peice of blank paper is not half as interseting as one with writing on it. I would have stood on my dig some time longer if George
      had not brought some religious remarks to bear, something about "doing good for evil"
      and when a fellowed pluged you in the snoot instead of hitting back give him another try at the other side,
      I thought I would take note paper as it would not take so many words to fill up
