   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00757_n1">1. In 1883 Whitman arranged
      with David McKay, his Philadelphia publisher, to print Bucke's <em>Walt Whitman</em> (1883). The poet personally supervised publication,
      including proofreading. The typesetting of Bucke's biography was completed on
      March 31 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
      Bucke generated some of the text, but Whitman controlled every detail, altering
      the proofs at will. On , Bucke wrote: "I
      open and read these parcels of proof in fear and trembling (you must go as easy
      as you can, you are the terrible surgeon with the knife &amp; saw and saw the
      patient). You left out my remarks on 'Children of Adam', I believe they were
      good but I acquiesce—your additions are excellent as they have been all
      through." On  Bucke was pleased with the
      book he and Whitman had produced: "I believe it will do, and if it will the
      Editor will deserve more credit than the Author—I am really surprised at
      the tact and judgement you have displayed in putting my rough M. S. into shape
      and I am more than satisfied with all you have done." Bucke, however, was not
      quite so pleased with Whitman's high-handed treatment of his book as his letters
      to the poet indicate. For in a letter on August 19 to O'Connor, who on August 16
      objected to "several omissions and commissions," Bucke wrote: "I do not care to
      go into these matters by letter but when you come [to Canada] I will make every
      thing clear to your comprehension" (Library of Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]
