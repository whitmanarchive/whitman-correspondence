      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This not so much if at all an exposure of anything [illegible] facts, thoughts, perhaps <u>idle</u> [illegible] with a lot [
      <span class="unclear">of?</span>]
       [illegible] to take [
      <span class="unclear">up.?</span>]
       [illegible] to [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">put?</span>]
       [illegible] list—lessness [illegible] to be better [illegible] all. <u>Charity</u>, not for you, [
      <span class="unclear">but?</span>]
       <u>for myself</u>, is the <u>motive</u>, as this is (forenoon of Monday, May 8,) a day when the fields are too much <u>soaked with rain</u> for out-door farming business, and the man is <u>lonesome</u>. (Now, if there were living near me, <u>such people</u> that I could take my Walt Whitman books with me, and by reading to them, or having
      them read for themselves, [
      <span class="unclear">rather?</span>]
       jump up and shout "glory, glory, hallelujah" like the good follks [
      <span class="unclear">do it?</span>]
       [illegible] pass the day well. [
      <span class="unclear">But it is?</span>]
       [illegible] so much [
      <span class="unclear">different?</span>]
       [illegible] I am a poor, [illegible]—as for styling myself [
      <span class="unclear">"philosopher," I?</span>]
        [illegible] that, and let you see [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">you have?</span>]
       guessed well if you have taken interest in the matter enough to <u>be guessing</u>—<u>it is not a term ever applied by others to me</u>, and has very seldom been used by me, 'till writing to you—a <u>nom de plume</u>—sometimes when I am talking to myself I use the title—also some years ago when I
      saw in a newspaper mention of a character (perhaps), a "J.N. the Philosopher" I thought
      it might be some one's mischief [
      <span class="unclear">concerning?</span>]
       myself on account of [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">drastic?</span>]
       manner in [
      <span class="unclear">conversations?</span>]
       [illegible]ality of ways [illegible] and my[illegible]sh to se[illegible] 
      
      
      
      they might fall into wrong hands, and being so frank or communicative—you see—
   </p>
   
   <p>[
      <span class="unclear">Possibly, possibly, you will?</span>]
       like to know how I like [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">it does me?</span>]
       great good to see [
      <span class="unclear">the <u>full</u>?</span>]
       [illegible]—a very proper [illegible] most <u>convincing</u> [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">open?</span>]
       [illegible] has [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">open eccentricity?</span>]
      , but for comfort, [
      <span class="unclear">very nice?</span>]
       [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">)—the intercalations?</span>]
        are good—I judge the new issue was printed from <u>old plates</u> still in your possession (printing and mis-printing all the same). How much would
      it cost to print for me about 6 copies of the full-length picture?
   </p>
   
   <p>When the two books came to the post-office, I read to the P.M., an old man of large
      body, brain, and general solidity, and a consistent Union man, the "Song of the Banner
      at Day-Break"—it <u>seemed</u> to please him powerfully.
   </p>
   
   <p>I tell you [
      <span class="unclear">fear not! "the Philosopher"?</span>]
       is a fine reader—[
      <span class="unclear">voice a little husky and nasal?</span>]
       at times, and [
      <span class="unclear">teeth awful bad, but the whole ?</span>]
       to bring [
      <span class="unclear">forth what lies slumbering is further?</span>]
       back than lips [
      <span class="unclear">or teeth. If I were a rich?</span>]
       man I would print [
      <span class="unclear">in great?</span>]
       [
      <span class="unclear">big?</span>]
       [
      <span class="unclear">big type, that?</span>]
       <u>Song</u>, for wide distribution at the Centennial, and if you pestered me about infringement
      of copy-right, I would pull your beard.
   </p>
   
   <p>In "Two Rivulets" I see nothing but what is good.</p>
   
   <p>The Passage to India and the Strong Bird &amp;c were not new to me—I had them before.
      Democratic Vistas was new—thinking of <u>lending the book</u> among the most suitable people around me (people perhaps too poor to buy for themselves
      [illegible] I have <u>marked</u> about [illegible] as condensed [
      <span class="unclear">expression?</span>]
       [illegible] of e[illegible]bol 
      
      
      a good deal in other places—your books tho' are bad books for [
      <span class="unclear">marking?</span>]
      —so many marks to make, the [
      <span class="unclear">object?</span>]
       [
      <span class="unclear">is defected?</span>]
      . I dont want my your books [illegible] but I like to lend them [illegible]—sending [
      <span class="unclear">out?</span>]
      [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">to come?</span>]
       into [
      <span class="unclear">the fact of the?</span>]
      [illegible] Not being a [illegible] have been any [
      <span class="unclear">enthusiast about flags of any sort?</span>]
      , or disposed to pronounce any (either) cause <u>certainly</u> just or holy, but I much admire all your "Flag and Union and Soldier and Hospital
      writings—I wouldnt give 10 cents for life-size paintings of Grant, Sherman, Lee, Johnston, Davis and
      [
      <span class="unclear">infinitures?</span>]
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>I wish you would sometime take up Democratic Vistas (for me)and read (Conscience)
      Page 62 and then bottom of Page 69—please read <u>all</u> of it (<u>for me</u>). All of Dem Vistas.
   </p>
   
   <p>Concerning <u>that Exposition</u>, and people coming or <u>not</u> coming to it, I see that I can get (or have) the means to come and pay <u>my</u> own [
      <span class="unclear">way?</span>]
      , first and last. As a matter of <u>policy</u>, here [
      <span class="unclear">is considerations?</span>]
      . A man with a large family, in resolving to spend, ought to think not merely of his
      <u>principal</u>, but of his <u>income</u>; think of the easiness, or the <u>difficulty</u> and <u>slowness</u> of <u>replacing</u> what he may spend. The principle of <u>self-denial</u> and paternal solicitude says for me to consider what good can I make it do my family
      if I make that visit to Phila.?
   </p>
   
   <p>Under some circumstances it may do much good—they [
      <span class="unclear">they wish me to do so?</span>]
      —I might please them [
      <span class="unclear">a great deal by this relation?</span>]
       of what I should [
      <span class="unclear">see—?</span>]
       [illegible]nd the [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">instruct?</span>]
      
      
      
      them, give all a taste for reading, and in time "elevated sentiments". Of course the
      crowding, and [illegible] and multitude of sights and [
      <span class="unclear">sounds would ?</span>]
       [illegible] a wild man very much, and [illegible] a distinct [
      <span class="unclear">remembrance of any ponderable part?</span>]
      . [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">kept and?</span>]
       freely [illegible] I know [
      <span class="unclear">under favorable conditions?</span>]
       the chance to see and talk with (just, lone, solitary) Walt Whitman would be half
      of my pleasure. And again, if I could write, speak, act, or look so as to win any
      considerable bit of kind notice, or useful suggestions from you, I know it would afford
      a great pleasure certainly, and <u>perhaps</u> be a valuable <u>moral stimulant</u> and elevator to the family. Put this against the [
      <span class="unclear">outlay?</span>]
      . I wish to [
      <span class="unclear">find the best book for?</span>]
       them, and to inspire them with [
      <span class="unclear">pride?</span>]
      , that they [
      <span class="unclear">may be worthy?</span>]
       [
      <span class="unclear">wise and?</span>]

   <p>[
      <span class="unclear">All stubbornly at my own expense.?</span>]
       As I write this, I am [illegible] to come there. I swear I wont if you say I shall not see you,
   </p>
   
   <p><u>But if</u> I could come at my convenient time, and hire lodging close to Walt, and step in for
      a week at your convenient times, and beard the (reticent) lion in his den, and make
      him give me a great deal of information and <u>good advice</u>, it might pay us here finely.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.
