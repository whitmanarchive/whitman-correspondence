   <p>It is just possible I have sent you a note of acknowledgment before—but I
      think not as I have been ill. (I suppose Pearsall Smith<sup><a href="#n4979" id="r1">1</a></sup> was the cause of your sending it to me.)

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4979">1. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
