      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A short time ago while on a visit to New York I happened one evening to find your
      <u>Leaves Of Grass</u> in Mr. Bayard Taylor's<sup><a href="#n0889" id="r2">2</a></sup> library: and taking it with me to my room at the hotel I spent a night of glory and
      delight upon it  How it happened that I had never read this book before . . is a story
      not worth the telling; but, in sending the enclosed bill to purchase a copy (which
      please
      
      
      
      mail to the above address) I cannot resist the temptation to render you also my grateful
      thanks for such large and substantial thoughts uttered in a time when there are, as
      you say in another connection, so many "little plentiful mannikins skipping about in collars and tailed coats." Although I entirely disagree with you
      in all points connected with artistic form, and in so much of the outcome of your
      doctrine as is involved in those poetic exposures of the person which your pages so
      unreservedly make, yet I feel
      
      
      sure that I understand you therein, and my dissent in these particulars becomes a
      very insignificant consideration in the presence of that unbounded delight which I
      take in the bigness and bravery of all your ways and thoughts. It is not known to
      me where I can find another modern song at once so large and so naïve: and the time
      needs to be told few things so much as the absolute personality of the person, the
      sufficiency of the man's manhood <u>to</u> the man, which you have propounded in such strong and beautiful rhythms. I beg you
      to count me among
      
      
      
      your most earnest lovers, and to believe that it would make me very happy to be of
      the least humble service to you at any time
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0888">1. Sidney Lanier (1842–1881) was
      a Southern poet and musician who fought for the Confederacy and eventually
      became a professor at Johns Hopkins University. See his , letter to Whitman. For more infromation about Lanier,
      see Lawrence I. Berkove, "Lanier, Sidney (1842–1881)," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="n0889">2. Bayard Taylor (1825–1878),
      translator of Goethe's <em>Faust</em>, journalist, and traveler,
      sent his "Picture of St. John" to Whitman on . He commended Whitman's "remarkable powers of expression" and
      "deep and tender reverence for Man." His letter of  was even more unreserved in its praise. Later
      Taylor's response to Whitman was to change dramatically. In <em>The Echo Club</em> (2d ed., 1876), 154–158, 168–169, Taylor
      burlesqued Whitman's poetry. William Sloane Kennedy lists him among Whitman's
      "Bitter and Relentless Foes and Villifiers"; see <em>The Fight of
         a Book for the World</em> (West Yarmouth, MA: The Stonecroft Press, 1926),
