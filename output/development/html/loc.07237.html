   <p>Your letter of 8th<sup><a href="#loc.07237_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> which came to hand last evening gave me great pleasure for I
      judged by the tone of it that you are decidedly better than you have been since that
      bad turn in June. If you can only hold your grip now! I am glad you have at last
      sold the horse &amp; phaeton<sup><a href="#n4172" id="r3">3</a></sup>—it is much better so. Yes, I do not know what we
      should all do without Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup> he is a grand fellow and sticks to
      his guns like an old soldier. Nothing new here about meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> or anything else.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4172">3. In September 1885, Whitman received
      a horse ("Nettie") and a phæton as a gift from a group of prominent
      friends, and he used the horse and carriage for three years. A photo is

   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
