   <p>Am sitting here toward 8—nothing very new—Am so-so, heavy-headed feeling &amp; the same
      old insuperable inertia—was out this afternoon in the wheel chair, the sun half-out
      in starts &amp; rather cool—Supper of rice &amp; mutton stew—I continue my non-mid-day
      meal or dinner—appetite fair—as I sit here my nurse Warren<sup><a href="#loc.00668_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> is down stairs
      practising on his fiddle—

   <p>Sunday 3 p m—Nothing amiss today—but dull dark rainy weather—am <em>pottering</em> over an
      article prose essay "<em>Old Poets—and other Things</em>," probably to be offer'd to <em>N[orth]
         A[merican] Review</em><sup><a href="#loc.07745_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—as they have ask'd me to write something for them—bowel
      action—had a good currying two hours ago—breakfast oysters, toast &amp; tea—y'r
      letters rec'd—am floating along carried idly, by the momentum of things I
      suppose—<em>stupidity</em> may be a strong word but it suggests if not describes my cond'n
      these times—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.00668_n4">2. Frederick Warren Fritzinger
      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,
      535).<a href="#r2">[back]
