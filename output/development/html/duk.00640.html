   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00640_n10">1. This letter dates to
      March 17, 1869. The calendar date, 17, and day of the week, Wednesday, are
      in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, but Richard Maurice Bucke dated the
      letter to the month February in the year 1869. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed
      with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). However,
      George Washington Whitman's satisfaction upon his receipt of a bank draft
      from Walt Whitman in this letter conflicts with George's frustration at not
      receiving a bank draft just before his departure in Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's  letter to Walt.
      Therefore, February 17, 1869 is an impossible date for this letter.<br><br>
      This letter dates to a month later, March 17, 1869, which is corroborated by
      Louisa's  letter to Walt and by
      Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's letter to Walt the following week. Louisa
      in her letter from two days earlier requested on George's behalf that Walt
      forward "five or six hundred." George also asked Walt to send a telegraph
      acknowledgment upon receipt of Louisa's letter because he had to depart for
      a foundry soon (see her  letter
      to Walt). According to this letter, George received Walt's telegraph
      dispatch just before he was to depart for Philadelphia, and he was pleased
      that he could expect a bank draft from Walt. A week later, Jeff had received
      a letter from Louisa (not extant) in which she explained that Walt has
      "stepped in" to assist George after his "troubles in getting money for the
      house" (see Jeff's  letter to
      Walt). Because this letter notes George's receipt of the telegraph dispatch
      and his relief that a "draft came to day" (March 17), Walt's actions during
      the past two days (telegraph dispatch and bank draft) are consistent with
      the requests that Louisa made on George's behalf in her March 15 letter.
      Jeff's March 25 letter to Walt confirms this series of events from March 15
      to 17, 1869.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00640_n8">2. Walt Whitman's March 15?,
      1869 letter is not extant. Because Edwin Haviland Miller dated this letter from
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman February 17, he dated Walt's missing letter February
      15, 1869 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 2:361).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00640_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      asked Walt Whitman to send a telegraph dispatch to acknowledge receipt of Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's  letter.
      George, according to the same letter, was to depart for the R. D. Wood Foundry
      site in Camden, New Jersey, to inspect the "new main" for Moses Lane, chief
      engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00640_n3">4. The <em>Brooklyn Directory</em> (1871) lists two Lotts as lawyers, Abraham and John
      Z., at 13 Willoughby Street. A man named Lott is also mentioned concerning title
      troubles for a property that George Washington Whitman sold to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's Atlantic Street neighbor Margret Steers (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00640_n5">6. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      had described George Washington Whitman's efforts to get a loan with his partner
      Smith's house as collateral in her  letter to Walt Whitman. Walt described George's partner Smith as
      "a natural builder and carpenter (practically and in effect) architect," and he
      advised John Burroughs that Smith was an "honest, conscientious, old-fashioned
      man, a man of family . . . . youngish middle age" (see Walt's  letter to John Burroughs).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00640_n7">7. George Washington Whitman
      offered Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman a mortgage on Smith's house, valued at
      $3,000, as collateral or, if Smith's house were sold, to repay Jeff's loan. Jeff
      began sending George monthly installments of $200. However, some confusion
      ensued about the relationship between this set of loans for $3,000 on Smith's
      house and an original $1,000 loan in two installments that Jeff and George had
      agreed upon when Jeff visited in December 1868 (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
       letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00640_n13">8. Edwin Haviland Miller
      suggested that this reference to something disagreeable in the office of the
      attorney general was related to Richard Maurice Bucke's description of
      "dastardly official insolence" from a high-ranking government official in the
      year 1869. See John Burroughs, <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, As Poet
         and Person</em> (New York: Redfield, 1871), 123; Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:80, n. 12.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n5">9. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
      later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
      Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
      pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
      correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
      poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
