   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00169_n1">1. This letter dates to April
      29, 1863. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter only Wednesday. The
      executors did not assign a date, and Edwin Haviland Miller appears not to have
      been aware of the letter (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:373). The letter must follow George Washington Whitman's  letter to his brother Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman. George, writing from Lexington, Kentucky, described
      his regiment as "encamped at Winchester about 16 miles from here" and reported
      that he had sent $350 to his mother. According to Louisa's letter, Jeff received
      a letter from George the previous Monday, and she echoed George's statement on
      his location and the amount of money sent. Therefore, Jeff received George's
      April 22, 1863 letter two days before this letter was written. George forwarded
      pay for soldiers in his regiment on April 19: his role in the process is
      corroborated in an April 23, 1863 letter in the <em>New York
         Sunday Mercury</em>. Also, Louisa addressed two matters from Walt Whitman's
      most recent letter: he sent shinplasters (currency of a small denomination) and
      inquired whether Henry D. Howell had visited (see his  letter to Louisa). Louisa acknowledged Walt's letter
      here. Therefore, this letter dates to the Wednesday that followed George's April
      22, 1863 letter to Jeff and Walt's April 28, 1863 letter to Louisa: April 29,
      1863.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n3">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son

         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00169_n3">3. The term shinplasters refers
      to paper money of a small denomination issued by the United States government
      from 1862 to 1878. According to Walt Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, "Mother, you rec'd a letter
      from me, sent last Wednesday, 22d. of course, with a small quantity of
      shinplasters."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n6">4. Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George

   <p id="tex.00169_n5">5. Mrs. Piercy was the wife of
      Henry R. Piercy, who operated sulphur baths at 5 Willoughby Avenue, Brooklyn.
      Walt Whitman in his  letter to Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman wrote, "I think it would be well for me to write a line to
      Mrs. Piercy, . . . so that you could take the baths again."<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="duk.00422_n2">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="tex.00169_n7">7. George Washington Whitman
      wrote to Thomas Jefferson Whitman on  from Lexington, Kentucky.<br><br>
      George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until
      the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of
      Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of
      Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn
      and began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and
      later a mason named French. George eventually took up a position as
      inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on George,
      see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00586_n3">9. Adams Express, a packet
      delivery service, was noted for its fast delivery, trustworthiness, and its
      guarantee of privacy for shippers. The Whitmans used Adams Express to transfer
      larger sums of money both during and after the war, but Walt Whitman generally
      sent his mother smaller sums via the postal service. George Washington Whitman
      was repaying in installments a loan that Walt had made to him when George was
      struggling financially in his speculative housebuilding business. For Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's account of George's loans from Walt and from his brother Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman, see her  letter to
      Walt. For more on Adams Express, see Hollis Robbins, "Fugitive Mail: The
      Deliverance of Henry 'Box' Brown and Antebellum Postal Politics," <em>American Studies</em> 50:1/2 (2009), 12–13.<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="tex.00169_n13">12. A special correspondent
      from the New York Fifty-first Volunteers to the <em>New York
         Sunday Mercury</em> signed as "Greenback." In his April 19, 1863 letter from
      Winchester, Kentucky, Greenback wrote, "Captain Whitman is ordered to Cincinnati
      to send the boys money by express" (April 23, 1863, [7]). The pseudonym
      "Greenback" may be a pun: Captain Whitman, the one sending the greenbacks
      (dollars) to New York, may be the special correspondent whose letter is printed.
      The <em>Sunday Mercury</em> was a weekly newspaper published from
      1839 to 1896.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">13. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York

   <p id="duk.00425_n5">14. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided
      in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a
      French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for
      his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah.<a href="#r14">[back]

      of the word "somewhere" are visible in the image. The letter is pasted into a
      manuscript book, and the final letters on the edge closest to the binding in the
      page image are often obscured. Most of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman manuscript
      letters in the bound volume entitled <em>Walt Whitman: A Series of
         Thirteen Letters from His Mother to Her Son</em>, held at the Harry Ransom
      Center, have obscured text on at least one page. Text from this page was
      recorded based on an examination of the physical volume, which allowed more text
      to be recovered.<a href="#r15">[back]

   <p id="tex.00169_n17">16. Andrew Jackson Whitman
      (1827–1863) was Walter Whitman, Sr., and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son,
      and Walt Whitman's brother. Andrew was seriously ill from tuberculosis, and the
      family struggled with a series of health crises before Andrew's death in
      December 1863. For more on Andrew, see Martin G. Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>

      June 1862. Howell had seen Walt in Washington, and Walt inquired whether Howell
      had visited his mother in Brooklyn (see Walt's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman).<a href="#r18">[back]
