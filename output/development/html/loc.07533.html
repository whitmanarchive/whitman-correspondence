   <p>Of late I have two or three times occupied spells of hours or two hours by running
      over with best &amp; alertest sense &amp; mellowed &amp; ripened by five years your
      1883 book (biographical &amp; critical) about me<sup><a href="#loc.07533_n6" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; L of G—&amp; my very
      deliberate &amp; serious mind to you is that you <em>let it stand just
         as it is</em>—&amp; if you have any thing farther to write or print book
      shape, you do so in an <em>additional</em> or further annex (of say
      100 pages to its present 236 ones)—leaving the present 1883 vol. intact as it
      is, any verbal errors excepted—&amp; the further pages as (mainly) reference
      to and furthermore &amp;c. of <em>the original vol.</em>—the
      text, O'C[onnor]'s<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r3">3</a></sup> letters, the appendix—every page of the 236 left as
      now—This is my spinal and deliberate request—the <em>conviction</em> the main thing—the details &amp; reasons not put
      down.<sup><a href="#loc.07533_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>

   <p>Dr Osler<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r5">5</a></sup> has call'd—evidently all right—I have a good deal of pain (often sort of
      spasmodic, not markedly violent) in the chest &amp; "pit of the stomach" for the last
      three days. O says it is nothing serious or important—&amp; prescribes a mustard
      plaster—lately we have a sort of cold wave &amp; I shouldn't wonder if that was behind
      it—(I have the mustard plaster on now)—It is bright &amp; sunny—rather cool—I have
      rec'd a long letter from Sidney Morse<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r6">6</a></sup> from Chicago<sup><a href="#loc.07533_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup>—no special news—Mr Summers,<sup><a href="#n6158" id="r8">8</a></sup> M
      P from England, has just call'd &amp; we've had a talk<sup><a href="#loc.07533_n4" id="r9">9</a></sup>—a nice fellow (how much more &amp;
      more the <em>resemblance</em> between the cultivated Englisher and Americaner)—I have been
      reading Miss Pardoe's "Louis XIIII"<sup><a href="#loc.07533_n5" id="r10">10</a></sup>—I wonder if as a sort of foil to the Carlyle
      reminiscences (T[homas]'s and J[ane]'s)—the same sort of business in another sphere
      &amp; land—Your letters come &amp; are always welcome—As I close I am sitting in my big
      chair in my room 1½ p m quiet &amp; measurably comfortable—

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n2002">3. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is

   <p id="loc.07533_n2">4. Bucke replied on : "I note all you say about my
      'W. W.' Your wishes will be religiously respected. I did think of considerable
      changes (for I am certain the book will sell by &amp; by) but was never set on
      them and less so lately. Yes, I shall leave it stand as it is and add under a
      later date what else I may have to say."<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n4302">5. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on

   <p id="n0862">6. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,

   <p id="n6158">8. The Irishman William Summers
      (1853–1893) was a member of the British Parliament, junior whip of the
      Liberal Party, and strong proponent of Irish home rule. He visited Whitman on
      September 26, 1888. His account of the visit was published in <em>The Pall Mall Gazette</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00539.html">October 18, 1888 </a>. Whitman said of the visit that "Summers hit me
      hard. He made a grand show-up—had fine ways—was young, strong,
      optimistic" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.74.html">Wednesday, September 26, 1888</a>).Summers came with a letter of
      introduction from Mrs. Costelloe dated September 1; see also Horace Traubel,
      With Walt Whitman in Camden (New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915), 2: 384-385,
      390-391. Of Summers' article in Pall Mall Gazette, "A Visit to Walt Whitman," on
      October 18, Walt Whitman observed: "It is good --pretty good: nothing to brag
      of, but passable" (Horace Traubel, With Walt Whitman in Camden [New York:
      Mitchell Kennerley, 1914], 3: 14).<a href="#r8">[back]

         Seventeenth Century</em> (1855), 2 vols., are now in the Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection. Walt Whitman made the same point on September 28, 1888 to Traubel:
      "Here is another world—. . . opposite to the gloominess, irascibility, of
      Carlyle and his extreme dissatisfaction with the condition of the world" (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.76.html">Friday, September 28, 1888</a>). Carlyle's <em>Reminiscences</em> appeared in 1881.<a href="#r10">[back]
