      <br></br><br></br>Dear Lewy,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I thought I would write you a few lines to-day—I suppose you rec'd a letter from me
      eight or nine days ago<sup><a href="#loc.00887_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I hope this will find you in good health &amp; spirits—I wrote to you not to go about
      too much, &amp; eat &amp; drink too freely, &amp; I must repeat the caution—a fellow can keep
      himself in good condition by a little care &amp; prudence—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, Lewy, the presentation to Dr Bliss<sup><a href="#loc.00887_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> came off last Saturday evening—it was in ward F—the beds were all cleared out, the
      sick put in other wards—the room cleaned, hung with greens &amp;c., looked very nice—the
      instruments were there on exhibition the afternoon. I took a view of them, they were in four cases, &amp; looked very fine—in the evening they were
      presented—speeches were made by one &amp; another—there was a band of music &amp;c—I stopt about 20 minutes, but got tired, &amp; went off among the boys that were confined to
      their beds—the room was crowded, &amp; every thing passed off right I heard—
   </p>
   
   <p>Lewy, we have had the hottest weather here I ever experienced—it has been now about
      ten days, &amp; no let up yet—Yesterday &amp; last night was the hottest, no rain for some
      time &amp; the air prickly &amp; burning—Still I am enjoying very good health, thank God—better
      this last week than I have had for two or three months—I have some thought of going on to New York for a short time, as I have not been home now
      in eight months, but if I do, I shall pretty surely return here before long—Lewy,
      the draft has been put through here in Washington the past week—they drafted lots
      of secessionists &amp; quite a good many darks—(I wonder if it wouldn't be a good plan
      to draft all of both them kinds)—I don't hear any particular war news—the Army of
      the Potomac is down around Warrenton—there are conscripts arriving there to fill up
      the reg'ts, more or less every day—it will be a great &amp; sudden change of life to many,
      especially such weather as this. —I believe I told you in my last letter about the strange way the baby was born in
      the Chaplain's—well the baby is alive &amp; growing like a pig, &amp; the father Mr Lane is
      getting well, Mrs Lane ditto—Dr Bliss is just going off on a furlough—the Chaplain
      &amp; wife have left on a furlough—Taber<sup><a href="#loc.00887_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; the rest in ward K are all right—there have been quite a good many deaths in hospital
      the past week or so, the heat is bad for the poor wounded men—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, Lewy, I must now wind up—I send you my love, my darling son &amp; comrade, &amp; request
      you to write me soon as convenient, how you are getting along &amp; all about things—I
      will write again before very long, till then good bye &amp; God bless you, dear son—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Lewis Kirke Brown (1843–1926) was
      wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on August 19, 1862, and lay
      where he fell for four days. Eventually he was transferred to Armory Square
      Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in February 1863. In a diary in the
      Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on February 19, 1863, as "a most
      affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come and sit by him." Because the
      wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on January 5, 1864. Whitman was
      present and described the operation in a diary (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection
      of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out
      in August 1864, and was employed in the Provost General's office in September;
      see Whitman's 
      . The following
      September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief
      of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until his retirement
      in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was prepared by Brown's
      family and is now held in the Library of Congress.) Brown had written from
      Judiciary Square Hospital on , and

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00887_n1">1. See Whitman's letter from 
      . Whitman had not
      received the letter Brown wrote on August 10, 1863.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00887_n2">2. The <em>Washington
         National Republican</em> of August 10, 1863 carried a two-column account of
      the presentation of five cases of surgical instruments to Bliss. Chaplain
      Jackson (see Whitman's letter from August 1,
      1863) declared with
      fervor: "We all love you, sir, for the kindness and urbanity with which you have
      always treated us."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00887_n3">3. J. A. Tabor seems to have been a
      patient at Armory Square Hospital. On July 18, 1864, Brown wrote to Whitman: "I
      suppose you herd that J. A. Tabor was killed. . . . in the wilderness the second
      days battle. I seen some men out of his company &amp; they say that he fell dead
      when he was shot" (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public
      Library).<a href="#r3">[back]
