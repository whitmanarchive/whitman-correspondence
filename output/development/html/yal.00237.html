   <p>I could not conveniently come to the West Phil: Depot—I have just written to
      Johnston leaving the hall, &amp;c to his selection (the night too, if
      necessary)—I am averse to a first class hall—(I shall certainly be on
      hand, if alive &amp; able, but the thing is yet a <u>prospecting</u>, &amp; we are not at all sure what we shall find.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am as usual—was over to Phila: last evening to a nice dinner party, all men,
      artists, &amp;c, Horace Furness, (a good fellow)—his brother Frank,
      architect<sup><a href="#yal.00237_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>—my friend Forney<sup><a href="#yal.00237_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Kirke,<sup><a href="#yal.00237_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> (of

      intention of going south or to California—Love to all inquiring Wash'n
      friends—

      The envelope for the letter bears the address: <u>John
         Burroughs</u> | care J B Marvin | Internal Revenue Bureau | Washington
      | D C. It is postmarked: Philadelphia | Mar | 27 | (?).<br><br>
      Joseph B. Marvin, one of Whitman's Washington friends, had visited Whitman on
      February 24 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). Marvin had been co-editor of <em>The
         Radical</em> in 1866–1867. Later he was employed in the Treasury
      Department in Washington.

   <p id="yal.00237_n3">2. That this letter was
      written in 1879 is confirmed by an entry in Whitman's Commonplace Book and by
      the reference to the New York lecture.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00237_n4">3. Furness (1833–1912)
      was the distinguished editor of the Variorum Shakespeare, and was one of the
      honorary pallbearers at Whitman's funeral. See also Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (New York: Mitchell
      Kennerley, 1914), 3:520. Frank Furness designed the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine
      Arts and was the teacher of Louis Sullivan, who described his mentor in <em>The Autobiography of an Idea</em> (New York: Press of the
      American Institute of Architects, 1926), 190–196.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00237_n5">4. John W. Forney
      (1817–1881) established the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in
      1857, the Washington <em>Sunday Morning Chronicle</em> in 1861,
      and the <em>Daily Morning Chronicle</em> in 1862. In 1878 he
      founded the Philadelphia <em>Progress</em>, a weekly magazine to
      which Whitman contributed; "The First Spring Day on Chestnut Street" appeared in
      the <em>Progress</em> on March 8, 1879 (<em>Specimen
         Days</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall [New York: New York University Press, 1963],
      188–190). During the Washington years Whitman's self-puffs had frequently
      appeared in Forney's newspapers. Later in 1879 the publisher accompanied Whitman
      to Kansas (see the letter from Walt to Louisa Whitman of ).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="yal.00237_n6">5. John Foster Kirk (not
      Kirke) (1824–1904) was editor of <em>Lippincott's
         Magazine</em> from 1870 to 1886.<a href="#r5">[back]
