      <br></br><br></br>Dear Abby,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Every thing here goes on pretty much the same with me. My health has been good since
      I last saw you. 
      It is very monotonous here, &amp; I sometimes feel like pulling up stakes in desperation—Abby,
      I have little to write about, only I wanted to write you something—I hear from you
      occasionally 
      by mother's letters—What a good girl Helen is, to go and make those nice calls on
      mother<sup><a href="#pml.00029_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I am grateful to her for so doing, 
      &amp; hope she will continue always—the same good affectionate Helen—&amp; indeed I am sure
      she always will be—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is very hot weather here—to-day it is 96 or '7—I am sitting here at my desk in
      the office—there is quite a breeze pouring in the window, but it is a warm wind—half
      our clerks are away on vacation. I shall leave Washington soon after the middle of
      August—then I will see you all, &amp; we will have some good talks.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Good bye, dear Abby—I send my love to Emily,<sup><a href="#pml.00029_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; all—The O'Connors are well—Jenny<sup><a href="#pml.00029_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> grows like every thing.
      
   </p>

      Affectionately

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pml.00029_n1">1. According to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's letter of , Helen
      Price had visited her on the preceding day. Probably Walt Whitman wrote because
      Helen was "wondering all the time why you dont write to her" (The Trent
      Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special
      Collections Library).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="pml.00029_n2">2. Walt Whitman did not
      refer to his mother's report that "
      emmily
      
       will be married this fall" (The Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke
