      <br></br><br></br>To Walt Whitman—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The reason of my writing this letter is because I have not got even a short letter
      from you to [illegible] you got one which I wrote about a month ago. Maybe the old man has been
      away from home—I will not permit myself to fear you [
      <span class="unclear">had?</span>]
       been bad sick. This is a
      pleasant morning, this Thursday, March 14. Temperature agreeable even to a still or
      [
      <span class="unclear">idle?</span>]
      
      person—no wind, a good deal smoky, birds chirping, children playing noisily
      and sweeping the yard. My boy is running my plow—preparing ground for our
      usual cotton crop—somehow there seems never to be much use for us to raise anything
      else—people buy too much of our other produce with <u>promises</u> which they do not comply with.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It looks like that I ought to be happy today—a home, my own—family
      healthy—no debts—not an enemy (brooding over injuries or insults) in the
      whole world—entire trust or confidence of everybody except such as <u>may</u> think <u>he must</u> be a bad man
      who denies "God".—Well, health will not last always; most of us must (as I
      state it) "be dragged to death [
      <span class="unclear">through?</span>]
       much of suffering" sometimes—maybe I [
      <span class="unclear">will get?</span>]
       off like my "papa"
      and his mother ([
      <span class="unclear">years
         apart?</span>]
      ) as if by lightning stroke. Other troubles spring up along the
      path for the majority—life is and must be a [
      <span class="unclear">fight,?</span>]
       a warfare, and a
      race,—then why should other—good people—Gods
       people despise us who say it is not good and beautiful that we should have
      to fight two fights and run two races at once? I have dreamed that the law we are
      under now is enough.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>What a variety of people on this earth! Living, last year and this, on my other farm
      (B)<sup><a href="#loc.02419_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> is
      an old man (perhaps 60 or 62) a local Methodist preacher, hot tempered; exceeding
      plucky for <u>war or work</u>; <u>neat</u>,
      stylish, or dressy and luxurious so far as able; pretty good common sense, somewhat
      reflective; can only [
      <span class="unclear">be?</span>]
      
      scrupulous God-ward, not perhaps, [
      <span class="unclear">such?</span>]
       man-ward,
      time and again clipping off profits or [
      <span class="unclear">more?</span>]
       of dues to creditors by neglect, refusal or
      "inability" to make final settlement. Now <u>the curious</u> is
      this,—he seems to think that preaching God and preaching worship and preaching
      dainty, formal, ceremoniousness is all that is morally good or grand—without
      saying so, seems to think that J. N.'s  truthfulness
      (always), unparalleled disinterestedness, candor, childlike simplicity, 
      practising
      
       and advocating frugality, plainness, moderation, self-denial, philo[illegible] content, plain
      speaking, are just about [
      <span class="unclear">worth?</span>]
       nothing or next to nothing. Do you share my astonishment? I
      have been too tender and kind to [
      <span class="unclear">impress?</span>]
       upon him that a preacher or Christian's [
      <span class="unclear">example?</span>]
       can't be worth much
      because people

      room—not very valuable—two farms—160, ⅓ cleared and
      cultivated—80, ¼ worn out and washed away, ¼ good and mellow for old
      Orthodox—he is poor (if proud and apostolic) and I sincerely pity him, but I
      think stubborn Orthodox people must themselves be hard-hearted—I have 40 acres
      timbered "ridge" land (I said our ridge, 11 miles long, splitting our long
      narrow valley was 150 feet high, that may be [

      when I go to its peaks—or ravines. I took that wild spot for my temple and to get

      two or three 
      
      [illegible] seeing yours, I [
      <span class="unclear">then?</span>]
       said [illegible] I could <u>write
         the</u>
      [illegible] as written—I thought, [illegible]
      <u>it</u> ought [
      <span class="unclear">to be?</span>]

      certainly this is not something I have been dreaming—<u>I

   </p>
   
   
   <p> About two weeks ago I walked, late one afternoon, 3 miles, to have a reading of some
      hours with our "best" school-teacher—we sat up some hours, with another young
      man of some intelligence, and read J. B.'s "Before Beauty—Before
      Genius—and a little in "Emerson" and "Whitman"—I did not take along your
      [
      <span class="unclear"><u>heavy</u>?</span>]
       works—just J.B.s book and War
      "Memoranda"—what think you? Two years ago this (kindly) "pedagogue" said he
      saw a Southern Newspaper then said <u>you were cruel to rebel
         prisoners</u> in the war. I <u>then</u> told him, perhaps
      the <u>paper</u> was only rebutting your Memoranda statements of
      Southern cruelties, by <u>it</u> stating how <u>we</u> suffered in <u>Northern</u> prisons—maybe <u>you</u>
      were sometimes <u>a little rough in conversation</u> with our hot-headed
      fools. I [
      <span class="unclear">wish to?</span>]
       keep
      J.B.s book, and I sent part pay ($1) in my Feb-letter. I said maybe you
      wished me to consider <u>myself</u> subtly, discreetly,
      beautifully, generously complimented in the <u>name</u> and several places of
      <u>the text</u> of <u>our</u> Two
      Rivulets??

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.
