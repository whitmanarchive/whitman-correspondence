      This postcard bears the address, "Pete Doyle, | M street South bet 4Â½ &amp;
      6th | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Philadelphia | Jul | 31(?)| 12 M
      | Pa.; Carrier | Aug | 1 | 8 AM."<br><br>
      The dating of this postcard as well as the notes and letters to Doyle on
      August , ,
      , and ,
      1874, depends in part on Whitman's habit of writing on Fridays. However, as
      evidenced in Whitman's  letter
      to Ellen O'Connor and his 
      letter to John and Ursula Burroughs, both of which were conclusively written
      in 1874, Whitman's "alternations" were especially marked during the summer
      of this year, and despite his "natural buoyancy" he was frequently depressed
      by the inability of his once healthy body to triumph over his
      ailments.<a href="#r1">[back]
