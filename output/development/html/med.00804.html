   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Donaldson
      (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
      introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
      the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
      carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt
         Whitman, the Man</em> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see

         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      letter are drawn from a catalog put out by George J. C. Grasberger, Inc. The
      location of this manuscript is presently unknown. Whitman had supper with the
      Donaldsons on December 4—"a very enjoyable evening, warm
      hospitality—fine children" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). Irving described a visit to Camden in <em>The Theatre</em>, 5 (April 1885), 178–179.<a href="#r1">[back]
