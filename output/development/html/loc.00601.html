   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Bethuel Smith, Company F,
      Second U.S. Cavalry, was wounded in 1863. He wrote to Whitman on , from the U.S. General Hospital
      at Carlisle, Pennsylanvia, "I left the armory hospital in somewhat of A hurry."
      He expected, he explained on ,
      to rejoin his regiment shortly, and was stationed near Washington when he wrote
      on . He wrote on , that he was in a camp near
      Mitchell Station, Virginia, where "the duty is verry hard." He was wounded again
      on June 11 (so his parents reported to Whitman on ), was transported to Washington, and went home on furlough on
      July 1. He returned on August 14 to Finley Hospital, where, on , he wrote to Whitman: "I would like
      to see you verry much, I have drempt of you often &amp; thought of you oftener
      still." He expected to leave the next day for Carlisle Barracks to be mustered
      out, and on , he wrote to Whitman
      from Queensbury, New York. When his parents communicated with Walt Whitman on
      , Bethuel was well enough to
      perform tasks on the farm. Smith was one of the soldiers to whom Whitman wrote
      ten years later; see Whitman's letter to Bethuel Smith, December 1874 (Edwin
      Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em>, 6 vols. [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:318–319).
