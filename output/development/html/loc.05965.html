      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your paper was received
      yesterday and was very much pleased with the
      Contents and also with your kindness in sending it.
      I saw in the paper the death of Mrs Johnson. I was
      very much surprised to see it and felt very sad about it
      although a stranger to me I never met one so lady
      like and pleasing as she was and made the remark
      several times what an entertaining hostess she was I thought
      she must have made your visit very pleasant for you
      while there. I am glad that your health is better
      than it has been. Our little Walter has been very sick
      since I saw you we were afraid we would lose him
      but is just well now all the rest are well, send
      there love to you hoping to see you soon.
      
   </p>

      this summer.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05965_n1">1. In an entry in his
      Commonplace Book on September 2, 1878, Whitman wrote the following note: "Mrs
      Sarah E Brown ?Bowen | Woodside L I | N Y | (infant little Walter)" (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839â€“1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). It seems likely, however, considering Whitman's
      uncertainty about the last name in this entry, that the sender of this letter
      was the same Mrs. Walter Bownes who sent a letter to Whitman dated .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
