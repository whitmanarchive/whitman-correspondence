   <p>We have had (glum &amp; dark yet) a severe storm &amp; blow &amp; destruction
      hereabout but I believe I am as serene as ever &amp; getting on
      comfortably—had a present of some plump sweet partridges<sup><a href="#loc.07552_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—&amp; half one for my breakfast—went
      well—I suppose you rec'd the <em>Critic</em><sup><a href="#loc.07552_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> and <em>American</em> sent last
      night—I believe the books,<sup><a href="#loc.07552_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> printing &amp;c. are going to eventuate
      satisfactorily from my point of view &amp; plans—no cyclone of
      success—but no special mishap—wh' is a great victory considering my
      wreck'd bodily condition—

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
