   <p>Thanks for kind letter &amp; the bit poem—like a real star-twinkle.<sup><a href="#nyp.00450_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> I continue sick but move slowly toward recuperation. The
      liver begins to act. It has not been an <em>engorgement</em> or any
      thing like it. The basic situation I take to be this—that just now the liver
      is the seat of, &amp; concentrates, that <em>markedly defective
         enervation</em> which my paralysis of 
      '73
      
       to 
      '7
      
       &amp;c. has left me for life. The doctor comes every day—(old
      school, but receptive &amp; progressive—believes more in drugs &amp; medicines
      than I do, but so far his diagnosis seems thorough, &amp; his doses are justified by
      results)—About that Heywood, Boston, arrest, mustn't there be some
      mistake?<sup><a href="#nyp.00450_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> The Chainey affair certainly settled the U.
      S. mail part—but the 
      Mass:
      
       statutes on printed "indecency" are sweepingly stringent I believe. Do
      you know that Rand &amp; Avery refused to <em>print</em> an edition
      of 
      L of G.
      
       for me, after the Osgood row?—afraid of indictment—Where is
      Charley Eldridge's address?

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00450_n3">1. This letter is addressed: Wm
      D O'Connor | Life Saving Service Bureau | Treasury | Washington | D C. It is
      postmarked: Camden | Oct | 29 | 6 PM / N.J.; Washington, Recd. | Oct | 30 | 4 30
      AM | 1882 | 2.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00450_n1">2. O'Connor included in his
      letter of  an extract from a newspaper
      entitled "L'Etranger," a poem not too unlike Whitman's own statements about
      adhesiveness (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953], 4:323).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00450_n2">3. Ezra H. Heywood
      (1829–1893), a radical reformer and an advocate of free love, was arrested
      on October 26, 1881, because he printed "To a Common Prostitute" and "A Woman
      Waits for Me" in <em>The Word</em> and attempted to mail the
      journals. On , O'Connor noted a
      newspaper report of Heywood's arrest: "I don't like Heywood's ways, and I don't
      like the Free-Love theories at all, but he has his rights, which these devils
      trample on" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.50.html">Monday, March 11, 1889</a>). See also the letter from Whitman to O'Connor
