   </p>
   
   
   <p>If you carefully write out the extracts I send you, &amp; punctuate them correctly,
      &amp; <em>read them slowly &amp; carefully</em>, it will be a success
      I am sure—
   </p>
   
   <p>George D Prentice<sup><a href="#nyp.00426_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> was a great Kentucky editor &amp;
      writer—Coleridge was an Englishman—both dead—I hope you will read
      the piece yourself—that is part of the trade <em>that has got to
         be begun &amp; gone through with</em>—read very slow, &amp; mind the
      pauses—I want the extracts return'd to me as they were wrote out for me by a
      lady friend I think a great deal of—Pluck up courage &amp; go ahead—
