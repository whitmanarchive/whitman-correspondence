      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Just a few lines to acknowledge the rec<u>t</u> this afternoon of
      yr very kind p.c., to thank you very cordially for it + to say how heartily glad I
      am to hear that your health was still so good—considering.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You must take extra care of yourself during the cold weather as nothing is more
      dangerous to such as you than a chill or a slight attack of bronchial catarrh. I am glad to hear that
      the celluloid negative reached you safely. I am copyrighting the photo: in England
      in your interest
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Thank you for your kind promise to send me copies of the <u>N. E.
         Mag.</u> + the Phila. Mag. containing article [illegible] to the arrival of which I shall look forward with
      pleasure.
   </p>
   
   <p>As I know that J. W. W.<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r1">1</a></sup> w<u>d</u> like copies
      would it be troubling you too much to send him one of each + I will remit the cash
      for all on receipt?
   </p>
   
   <p>I called at his office today but did not see him + I have sent him a facsimile
      (traced) copy of y<u>r</u> p.c. I am writing this in a patient's house
      where pen + ink are not available, while waiting the advent of a tardy "little
      stranger" as I do not wish to miss the mail tonight.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope this will find you in improved health + "with jocund heart still beating in
      your breast."
   </p>
   
   <p>I cannot write more at present.</p>
   
   <p>Again thanking you for y<u>r</u> kindness + with best love to
      you
   </p>

   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>P.S. I have had two more letters from Edmund Mercer. He says he has written to
      you
   </p>
   
   <p>P.P.S. Just got home in time to post this—"<u>it's a
         boy</u>" + a sturdy little chap he is with a voice like a clarionet!
   </p>
   
   <p>I send you a copy of a nice little edition of "Auld Lang Syne"—"something
      for a token"
