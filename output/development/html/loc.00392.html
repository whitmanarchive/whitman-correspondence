      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just now received yours of the 1st.<sup><a href="#loc.00392_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> I should have written to you before but when I left home a week ago yesterday Mother
      said she would write to you that day, and I believe she did, its singular that you
      have not received it
   </p>
   
   <p>Everything remains abt. as usual with us Walt. Mother has taken the house and rented the lower part to a
      Mr "John Brown"<sup><a href="#loc.00392_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> @ $14 per month Mat and I keeping the same rooms as before.<sup><a href="#loc.00392_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> Andrew has been very sick but was getting better on Sunday when I was home. His disease
      commenced by a very violent pain in the side, kept up and made worse by an ignorent Dr. and those around him.<sup><a href="#loc.00392_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> Mother visited him most every day and kept his courage up
   </p>
   
   <p>I am truly glad Walt, that you are comfortably situated and the more so that you are
      having things done to suit you in the way of publishing your book. I quite long for
      it to make its appearence. What jolly times we will have reading the notices of it wont we. you must expect
      the "Yam Yam Yam" writer[s] to give you a dig as often as possible but I dont suppose
      you will mind it any more than you did in the days of your editorship of the B.[rooklyn]
      Eagle<sup><a href="#loc.00392_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> when the Advertiser['s] Lees<sup><a href="#loc.00392_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup> used to go at you so roughly &nbsp;Do you remember those days Walt.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was at home as usual last Sunday but there was nothing new &nbsp;we miss you very much
      of course. Mother speaks very often of her small family now and talks of one room
      and bedroom &amp;c &nbsp;Mattie remains the same, she has plenty to do and talks of getting
      a girl to do housework. I'm getting to be quite a family man aint I.<sup><a href="#loc.00392_n8" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>When do you suppose you will get through and come home. Mother has heard from you
      several times and it does her a great deal of good.<sup><a href="#loc.00392_n9" id="r8">8</a></sup> you must write her often and let me hear from you again before long. I shall write
      to you again presently, now as you will perceive I am rather hard up for something
      to write about.
