   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0818">1. Not much information is known about
      Thomas B. Freeman other than that he was a young man in whom Whitman took an
      interest. Freeman notes that he was "born the first year of the war," which
      would make him roughly 16 years old at the time of his first letter to Whitman.
      The poet mentioned sending Freeman material on several occasions (most likely a
      copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, a newspaper piece by Whitman
      that appeared in the Philadelphia <em>Times</em>, and a copy of
      <em>Drum-Taps</em>). See <em>Walt Whitman:
         Daybooks and Notebooks</em>, ed. William White (New York: New York
      University Press, 1978), 1:32, 36, and 56.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02111_n1">2. This letter is endorsed, in
      Whitman's hand: "from Tom Freeman | May '77."<a href="#r2">[back]
