      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just this moment received your letter dated last Monday evening—dear mother,
      I have not seen any thing in any paper where the 51st is, nor heard any thing, but
      I do not feel any ways uneasy about them, I presume they are at Knoxville, Tennessee<sup><a href="#loc.00815_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Mother, they are now paying off many of the regiments in this army—but about George I suppose there will be delays in sending money &amp;c—dear mother, I
      wish I had some money to send you, but I am living very close by the wind—Mother,
      I will try somehow to send you something worth while, &amp; I do hope you will not worry
      &amp; feel unhappy about money matters—I know things are very high—Mother, I suppose you
      got my letter written Tuesday last, 29th March, did you not?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been going to write to Jeff for more than a month—I laid out to write a good
      long letter, but something has prevented me, one thing &amp; another—but I will try to
      write to-morrow sure—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I have been in the midst of suffering &amp; death for two months worse than ever—the
      only comfort is that I have been the cause of some beams of sunshine upon their suffering &amp; gloomy souls &amp; bodies too—many of the dying I have been with
      too—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, mother, you must not worry about the grocery bill &amp;c, though I suppose you will
      say that is easier said than followed—(As to me I believe I worry about worldly things
      less than ever, if that is possible)—Tell Jeff &amp; Mat I send them my love—Gen Grant
      has just come in town from front—the country here is all mud again—I am going to a
      spiritualist medium<sup><a href="#loc.00815_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> this evening, I expect it will be a humbug of course, I will tell you next letter—dear
      mother, keep a good heart—
   </p>

      <br></br>Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>How is Californy?—tell Hat her uncle Walt will come home one of these days, &amp; take her to New York
      to walk in Broadway—poor little Jim,<sup><a href="#loc.00815_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> I should like to see him—there is a rich young friend of mine wants me to go to Idaho
      with him to make money<sup><a href="#loc.00815_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00815_n1">1. In his letter of  from Annapolis, Maryland, to his
      mother, George traced the itinerary of the Fifty-first Regiment: "When I last
      wrote you [March 6] from Nashville Tenn. we were just about leaving that place
      for the front. Well we went to Knoxville by way of Chattanooga, stopped at
      Knoxville a day or two, and then were ordered to a place called Mossy Creek,
      about 40 miles beyond Knoxville. The next day after we arrived at the Creek we
      were ordered to bout face and travel over the same ground again back to this
      place. We arrived here yesterday having been nearly two weeks on the journey,
      our Regt. came nearly all the way by Rail Road."

   <p id="loc.00815_n2">2. The celebrated medium,
      Charles H. Foster. Whitman referred to the seance again in his letter from . Foster's
      career is described by George C. Bartlett, <em>The Salem Seer:
         Reminiscences of Charles H. Foster</em> (New York: United States Book
      Company, 1891), and by Arthur Conan Doyle, <em>The History of
         Spiritualism</em> (New York: George H. Doran Company, 1926) 2:30–34.
      Note also Whitman's interest in Mrs. Hatch in his June 20, 1857 letter to Sarah
      Tyndale. See Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1961–77),
      1:42–44).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00815_n4">3. Whitman is possibly
      referring to Captain John Mullan. See the letter from  for more
      information. Apparently
      Mrs. Whitman's letter to which this is an answer is not extant.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.00815_n3">4. Jim was a newphew to
      Whitman and the son of Andrew Jackson Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
