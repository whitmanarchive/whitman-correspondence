      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am perched up high on the side of Malvern Hill in a rediculous little red. brick
      house, and out of the window I see a great plain being splashed with rain. I am
      paying a visit—it is a vacation—to Benjamin Jowett,<sup><a href="#loc.03823_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> the Head of my college, a venerable and dreadful person
      in whose presence we all  tremble at Oxford. But here he is very good, and talks about the
      old times when England was full of venerable abuses. It makes one realize how much
      your generation—my father's generation—has done for progress, I only
      hope we young ones will do half as well. I hear of you from Alys,<sup><a href="#n7014" id="r2">2</a></sup> she is our great tie with America now. I have put myself into the machine
      at Oxford, and 
      shall not be turned out for about two years, then I hope to see America again.
   </p>
   
   <p>My father<sup><a href="#n4979" id="r3">3</a></sup> is extremely well, and enjoying life. Mrs.
      Costelloe<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> has got a pair of spectacles, and is as
      strong as she ever was. Whenever I go away from London Ray Costelloe<sup><a href="#n3137" id="r5">5</a></sup> grows visibly in the meantime. I met the other day a great  friend of yours,
      Mr. Yorke Powell,<sup><a href="#loc.03823_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> he is coming over to see you sometime.
      He spoke of "November Boughs"<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r7">7</a></sup> with enthusiasm, some of the
      prose he set in an examination at Oxford. If I were at home I am sure all would send
      love—as I do—from your friend

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03823_n2">1. Benjamin Jowett (1817–1893) was elected 
      master of Balliol College in 1870, which he turned into the leading college in Oxford.
      He fostered a network of friends that included Tennyson, Browning, Sir Robert Morier,
      and Florence 
      Nightingale. He had a great interest in advancing young men's lives and reforming
      his university, and was 
      remembered for his fond friendship and sometimes overbearing nature (Peter Hinchliff
      and John Prest, "Jowett, 
      Benjamin," <em>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</em> [2006]).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n7014">2. Alyssa Whitall "Alys" Pearsall
      Smith (1867–1951) was born in Philadelphia and became a Quaker relief
      organizer. She attended Bryn Mawr College and was a graduate of the class of
      1890. She and her family lived in Britain for two years during her childhood and
      again beginning in 1888. She married the philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1894;
      the couple later separated, and they divorced in 1921. Smith also served as the
      chair of a society committee that set up the "Mothers and Babies Welcome" (the
      St Pancras School for Mothers) in London in 1907; this health center, dedicated
      to reducing the infant mortality rate, provided a range of medical and
      educational services for women. Smith was the daughter of Robert Pearsall and
      Hannah Whitall Smith, and she was the sister of Mary Whitall Smith
      (1864–1945), the political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n4979">3. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">4. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="loc.03823_n3">6. Frederick York Powell (1859–1904) was a lecturer 
      and tutor of Christ Church at Oxford and became the Regius Professor of Modern History.
      He focused on Icelandic 
      scholarship, English history, modern French poetry, and helped to found the <em>English Historical 
         Review</em> (Oliver Elton, <em>Frederick York Powell: A Life and a Selection from His Letters
