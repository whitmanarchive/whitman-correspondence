      <br></br>Hartford,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">May 24/89.
      
      <br></br><br></br>To Walt Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You have lived just the seventy years which are greatest in the world's history &amp;
      richest in benefit &amp; advancement to its peoples. These seventy years have done
      much more to widen the interval between man &amp; the other animals than was
      accomplished by any five centuries which preceded them.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>What great births you have witnessed! The steam press, the steamship, the steel ship,
      the railroad, the perfected cotton-gin, the telegraph, the telephone, the
      phonograph, the photograph, photo-gravure, the electrotype, the gaslight, the
      electric light, the sewing machine, &amp; the amazing, infinitely varied &amp;
      innumerable products of coal tar,
   </p>
   
   
   <p>2</p>
   
   <p>those latest &amp; strangest marvels of a marvelous age. And you have seen even
      greater births than these; for you have seen the application of anaesthesia to
      surgery-practice, whereby the ancient dominion of pain, which began with the first
      created life, came to an end in this earth forever; you have seen the slave set
      free, you have seen monarchy banished from France, &amp; reduced in England to a
      machine which makes an imposing show of diligence &amp; attention to business, but
      isn't connected with the works. Yes, you have indeed seen much—but tarry yet a
      while, for the greatest is yet to come. Wait thirty years, &amp; <u>then</u> look out over the earth! You shall see marvels
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>3</p>
   
   <p>upon marvels added to these whose nativity you have witnessed; &amp; conspicuous
      above them you shall see their formidable <u>R</u>esult—<u>M</u>an at almost his full stature at last!—&amp; still
      growing, visibly growing while you look. In that day, who that hath a throne, or a
      gilded privilege not attainable by his neighbor, let him procure him slippers &amp;
      get ready to dance, for there is going to be music. Abide, &amp; see these things!
      Thirty of us who honor &amp; love you, offer the opportunity. We have among us 600
      years, good &amp; sound, left in the bank of life. Take 30 of them—the richest
      birth-day gift ever offered to
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>4</p>
   
   <p>poet in this world—&amp; sit down &amp; wait. Wait till you see that great
      figure appear, &amp; catch the far glint of the sun upon his banner; then you may
      depart satisfied, as knowing you have seen him for whom the earth was made, &amp;
      that he will proclaim that human wheat is worth more than human tares, &amp; proceed
      to reorganize human values on that basis.
