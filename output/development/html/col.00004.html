      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Tennyson,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>It is a long time since my last to you.<sup><a href="#col.00004_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I have however mailed you once or twice pieces of mine in print which I
      suppose you rec'd. Jan. '73 I was taken down with illness—some three months,
      afterward was recovering at Washington, when called here by the death of my
      mother—&amp; from that time becoming worse, I have given up work &amp; remained
      here since.<sup><a href="#col.00004_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I had paralysis from cerebral anemia.<sup><a href="#col.00004_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> 
   </p>
   
   <p>I rec'd your last letter, &amp; the good, good photograph—which I have looked at
      many times, &amp; sometimes almost fancied it <u>you</u> in person
      silently sitting nigh. To-day, a cloudy &amp; drizzly Sunday, I have taken it in my
      head, sitting here alone &amp; write—follow the inner mood—(a tinge of
      Quaker blood &amp; breed in me)—though really without any thing to say, only just
      to write to you.
   </p> 
   
   <p>It is pleasant here, right on the banks of the noble Delaware, opposite Philadelphia.
      The doctors say I shall yet come round, &amp; I think so too. I do not fail in flesh,
      color, spirits—appetite &amp; sleep pretty
      good—am up &amp; dressed every day, &amp; go out a little—but very lame
      yet.
   </p>

      Truly your friend—
      <br></br>WW
      
   </p>
   
   To Tennyson, May 24 '74.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.
