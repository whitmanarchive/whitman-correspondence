      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt:
      
   </p>    
   
   <p>I got your letter of the 6th, a postal card of the 11th,<sup><a href="#loc.03347_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> divers newspapers, and day
      before yesterday the handsome magazine with the pen-an-ink portrait—a
      beautiful piece of work, but a bad likeness—in fact, a caricature, which I
      hope, as Voltaire<sup><a href="#n4296" id="r3">3</a></sup> said of the "Letter to Posterity," is a
      letter that will never reach its address. He has given you a wad for a mouth and
      made you squint like one of George Borrow's<sup><a href="#n4295" id="r4">4</a></sup> gipsies. Drat  his
      imperence!
   </p>
   
   <p>I have had it on my mind for a month to write, but have had a bad time. I thought
      of
      you anxiously during the abominable swelter of August, and felt rejoiced when the
      cool spell came, hoping it would do you good, though I got a cold out of it, by ill
      luck, which pulled me back considerably.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter was very comforting. I shall hope to hear good news of you. I sent your
      messages to Dr. Channing,<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>
       Grace<sup><a href="#n6143" id="r6">6</a></sup> and
      Stedman.<sup><a href="#n1043" id="r7">7</a></sup> No news has reached me about the calendar, but I
      hope it is all right. Grace is expected here in a few days.
   </p>
   
   <p>Who is it writes of you so friendlily in the editorial notes of <u>Lippincott</u>?
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall hope all good things for <u>November Boughs</u>.<sup><a href="#loc.07454_n2" id="r8">8</a></sup> I wish it
      were further along.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been using the spare hours when I have felt less weak and woe-begone than I
      usually do, and less weighted down with office work, to scratch  off in pencil a
      defence of Donnelly's<sup><a href="#n4108" id="r9">9</a></sup> book for the N. A. Review, if I can only
      get it in. It has been a bad task, but a duty, for the reviewers have been
      outrageous.
   </p>
   
   <p>My hope and heart are high for you. If the weather will only let up!</p>
   
   <p>Good bye. I find that I can't write much, as I hoped to when I began. As the Indian
      said to Roger Williams<sup><a href="#n4297" id="r10">10</a></sup> when they landed at Seekonk, "What
      cheer, brother, what cheer!"—meaning, all cheer!<sup><a href="#loc.03347_n3" id="r11">11</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03347_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street, | Camden, | New Jersey. It is postmarked: Aug
      31.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03347_n2">2. O'Connor may be referring to

      letter of August 11, 1888 may not be extant.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4296">3. François-Marie Arouet
      (1694–1778), primarily known by his pen name Voltaire, was a French
      Enlightenment writer, historian, and philosopher. Voltaire often used satire to
      criticize the Catholic Church and governmental censorship.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4295">4. George Henry Borrow
      (1803–1881) was an English author, best known for <em>The
         Zincali</em> (1841), <em>Lavengro: The scholar, the gypsy, the
         priest</em> (1851), and <em>The Romany Rye</em> (1857), all of
      which are novels based on his experiences traveling across Europe. Borrow's
      writing is particularly fascinated with Gypsie life and culture.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00945_n5">5. William F. Channing
      (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
      Whitman stayed at his home in October, 1868.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6143">6. Grace Ellery Channing
      (1862–1937) was a writer and editor. She was the niece of William D.
      O'Connor. In 1894 she married artist Charles Walter Stetson, soon after his
      divorce from Channing's lifelong friend, writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman. After
      her initial refusal to ever read Whitman's work, Channing became enthralled by
      the poet's words and, in 1887, had the idea of creating an illustrated calendar
      with excerpts from <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. The illustrations
      would be made by Walter Stetson. The project was never realized. For more on the
      calendar project, see see Joann Krieg, "Grace Ellery Channing and the Whitman
      Calendar," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 12:4 (1995),
      252–256. Channing published her own volume of Whitman-inspired poetry
      titled <em>Sea-Drift</em> in 1899.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1043">7. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07454_n2">8. Whitman was working on his
      book <em>November Boughs</em> at this time, and it was published
      in October 1888 by Philadelphia publisher David McKay. For more information on
      the book, see James E. Barcus Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4108">9. Ignatius Loyola Donnelly
      (1831–1901) was a politician and writer, well known for his notions of
      Atlantis as an antediluvian civilization and for his belief that Shakespeare's
      plays had been written by Francis Bacon, an idea he argued in his book <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in Shakespeare's
         Plays</em>, published in 1888.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4297">10. Roger Williams (c.1603–1683)
      was an English Reformed theologian and founder of the colony of Providence
      Plantation in 1636. Williams was also an early abolitionist, and advocated for
      fair treatment of foreign and indigenous peoples in the British colonies. For
      more on Williams, see James P. Byrd Jr., <em>The Challenges of
         Roger Williams: Religious Liberty, Violent Persecution, and the Bible</em>
      (Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 2002).<a href="#r10">[back]

   <p id="loc.03347_n3">11. : When Roger Williams was exiled by the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his unorthodox
      views, 
      he began to build a settlement on the Seekonk River in the winter of 1635–1636, but
      was told by Colony authorities that he needed to cross the 
      Seekonk to be outside Colony jurisdiction. When he and his followers arrived on the
      south side of the river, so the story goes, he was greeted by a group of 
      Narragansett natives, who shouted "What Cheer Netop!" "Netop" meant "friend," and
      "What Cheer" was a common English greeting of the time, 
      asking "what good tidings do you bring?" Williams would soon found the settlement
      of Providence.<a href="#r11">[back]
