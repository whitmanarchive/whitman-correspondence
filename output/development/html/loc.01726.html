   <p>You may and doubtless will think very strange of a perfect stranger writing to you,
      but I have read all I could ever find of your writings and have studied and admired
      you more than all of the others on the top of Gods green Earth to gether and seeing an article in the N.Y. Herald a few days ago regarding
      your misfortune. I wish to say I should like to subscribe
      
      
      
      to your forthcoming book (as I understand through the press you are about to publish
      one.)
   </p>
   
   <p>I often think of a passage in your "Leaves of Grass" when you say it is wonderful
      how we "affect each other without ever seeing each other" and have sometimes felt
      an almost irresistible impulse to come where you are and talk with you face to face.
   </p>
   
   <p>I think you will understand my motive well enough to think this emanates from a sincere
      feeling of admiration of your genius. of all the original writers (if there be such
      thing as an original writer) I think you are the
      
      
      most original. You have inspired me with thoughts most sublime <u>to myself</u> and I devoutly thank you accept this humble tribute in the same spirit which has
      prompted it is the wish of your devoted admirer

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Hine (1827–1871) was a portrait and
      figure painter best known for his nude figure entitled <em>Sleep</em>. Hine did an early oil painting of Walt Whitman, the engraving
      of which served as the basis for Stephen Alonzo Schoff's engraving of the poet
      for <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860).
