      Nothing notable with me—still sort o' moping.—I am sitting here in the little front
      room—it is snowing roundly outside &amp;
      wind east—Just got a letter from Morse<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r4">4</a></sup>—he seems to be all right<sup><a href="#nyp.00689_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup>—he
      is in Richmond Indiana yet—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am not doing any thing particular—idly eking out the time—I send some
      letters that have come &amp; the "Preface" proof—but not papers or
      books—cold, cold here—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00689_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Ernest Rhys | care W S Kennedy | Belmont | Mass:. It is postmarked: Camden (?) |
      Jan [18] | 6 AM | 88; Philadelphia, Pa. | Jan | 17 | 12 M | 1888 |
      Transit.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00689_n2">2. Rhys arrived in the
      United States early in December 1887 and apparently spent most of the month in
      or near Camden. He was with Whitman at a Christmas dinner at the home of Mr. and
      Mrs. Thomas B. Harned. Whitman noted: "Ernest Rhys here daily—his talks
      &amp;c. ab't English matters &amp; people" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles
      E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">3. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0862">4. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00689_n3">5. On December 22, 1887,
      Morse, "who has been here the last seven or eight months, started this evn'g by
      western RR. for Richmond Indiana" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). At this time Thomas Eakins was doing his famous
      portrait of the poet.<a href="#r5">[back]
