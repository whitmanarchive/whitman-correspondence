   </p>
   
   <p>Sir I rec'd a letter from Mr William [
      <span class="unclear">H.?</span>]
       Bascom<sup><a href="#loc.00868_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      [
      <span class="unclear">242 F?</span>]
       Street stating that
      our testimony did not [
      <span class="unclear">agree?</span>]
       with the company rolls in regard to my son Henry F Doore's death, he
      and Clarence F belonged to the 31 Maine Co. H. J. S. Harlow was their Capt. he was
      mortally wounded the 30th of Sept. 1864 the same day that Henry was there were only
      thirteen of that company that went into the charge only five came out. I don't know
      as
      there was any officer higher than a corporal left that was then with them, they had
      four
      days fighting which ended the third day of Oct. Henry was reported missing in
      action the 4 of Oct. I suppose the list was made up the 4 of Oct. they either made
      a
      mistake or else did not know exactly about it. Clarence was the only one that saw
      him
      after he was wounded the rebs nearly surrounded them they were scattered and running
      for
      their lives. Henry was mortally wounded. Clarence stopped with him a minute or two
      the
      rebs were so near he had to leave him. I am very sure that there has been a record
      of
      him at the Adjutant General's office that would agree better with ours will you take
      the
      trouble to go there and ascertain what you can about it, and tell Mr. Bascom. I thought
      that would be evidence enough, perhaps better than I could get here, there is one
      private that I suppose knows Clarence came back without him the 30th of Sept. but
      I
      think he is now about 30 or 40 miles off the traveling very bad now
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall have to take an other piece of paper I thought I should write only a few lines
      and that would be enough. I need the pension money very much. Clarence's health is
      very
      poor has not been able to study much nor attend to any kind of business. Mr. Bascom
      desired me to return his letter with the evidence required if you find sufficient
      evidence (please ask Mr. Bascom if he wants me to send his letter back) if you will
      take
      the trouble to assist me about this matter I shall be very much obliged.
   </p>

      very respectfully yours
      <br></br>in haste
      <br></br>Charlotte St. Clair
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>my best wishes to you and Mrs. O'Connor<sup><a href="#duk.00436_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I will send this directed to Mrs O'Connor as I don't know exactly how to direct to
      you please write as soon as you find out what you can.<sup><a href="#loc.00868_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I
      thought perhaps I could write to you and get an answer before I could get the
      evidence required here. Mr Abbot offered to assist me if necessary if he is there
      perhaps he can use his influence in my favour. he gave me a free pass home and
      appeared very friendly I don't think it strange that that mistake was made as the
      company was in such a condition I will close again it is about midnight so good
      night
   </p>
   
   <p>haven't forgotten the many favours I have already rec'd from you</p>
   
   <p>Clarence hasn't got quite over his fall but is so that he goes about some the rest
      of
      us are as well as usual

   <p id="duk.00436_n3">2. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor
      was the wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Walt Whitman's
      staunchest defenders. Walt may have mentioned a potential visit by Nelly and her
      daughter during his May visit to Brooklyn, though whether a visit came near this
      time is not known from his or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters. Walt Whitman
      dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington years, and he spoke
      often in his letters of their daughter Jean (called "Jenny" or "Jeannie").
      Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break off their friendship in late
      1872 over a disagreement about Reconstruction policies and the role of
      emancipated slaves, Nelly would remain friendly with Whitman. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00868_n3">3. For a time Whitman lived
      with William and Ellen O'Connor, who, with Eldridge and later Burroughs, were to
      be his close associates during the early Washington years. William D. O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an
      abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. He had been an
      assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> before he
      went to Washington. O'Connor was an intelligent man who deserved something
      better than the various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his
      death. The humdrum of clerkship, however, was relieved by the presence of
      Whitman whom he was to love and venerate—and defend with a single-minded
      fanaticism and an outpouring of vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been
      equaled. He was the first, and in many ways the most important, of the adulators
      who divided people arbitrarily into two categories: those who were for and those
      who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised O'Connor in the preface to a
      posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born sample here in the 19th
      century of the flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood. Thrice
      blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York,
      D. Appleton, 1910] pp. 513).<a href="#r3">[back]
