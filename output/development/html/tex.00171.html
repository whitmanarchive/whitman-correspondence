   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."
   </p>

<div class="editorial_notes">
   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00171_n9">1. This letter dates to May 30,
      1869. The executors did not mark this letter with a date, and Edwin Haviland
      Miller did not list it in his calendar of letters (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:367). Based on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's belief that Emily
      Price had married recently, this letter dates to the year 1869. The month, May,
      can be inferred from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter "M" and her  letter: "i suppose you know Emily
      price is going to get married." However, the date of Emily Price's marriage is
      not certain. In her  letter to Walt
      Whitman, Louisa wrote, "i beleive they think emmily [Price] will be married this
      fall." That later letter cannot be easily reconciled with this one, but perhaps
      the marriage was delayed several months without Louisa's being aware of the
      postponement. Despite that complicating difficulty, this letter's date in May
      corresponds to the appointment of a new Brooklyn Water Board.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00613_n1">2. Walt befriended Peter Doyle
      (1843–1907), a horsecar conductor in Washington, around 1865. Though
      Whitman informed Doyle of his flirtations with women in their correspondence,
      Martin G. Murray affirms that "Whitman and Doyle were 'lovers' in the
      contemporary sense of the word." Doyle assisted in caring for Whitman after his
      stroke in January 1873. See Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00155.html">"Pete the Great: A Biography of Peter Doyle."</a><a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n5">3. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
      later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
      Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
      pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
      correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
      poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00171_n7">4. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      "harpers" refers either to <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_titles/per.00041.html"><em>Harper's Monthly</em></a> or to <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_titles/per.00162.html"><em>Harper's Weekly</em></a>. The former, designed to
      promote Harper and Brothers' reprints of British novels, debuted during the
      summer of 1850 and began publishing poems by Whitman in 1874. The latter, <em>Harper's Weekly</em>, debuted in 1857. Walt Whitman's poem
      "Beat! Beat! Drums!" appeared in the September 28, 1861 issue of the newspaper,
      and two poems by Whitman were first published in the periodical in the 1880s.
      Though designed like its sister monthly to promote British reprints, <em>Harper's Weekly</em> was notable for its Civil War coverage
      and began publishing American writers in the ensuing decades.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n11">5. Helen Price was the
      daughter of Abby and Edmund Price. Abby Price and her family, especially her
      daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman and his mother, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman. Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform
      movements. Price's husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and
      the couple had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in
      1852, at 2 years of age). In 1860, the Price family began to save Walt's
      letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman were included in Richard Maurice
      Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1883), and she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters to
      her mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00171_n3">6. Emily "Emma" Price was the
      daughter of Abby and Edmund Price. The date of her marriage is difficult to
      determine. According to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman, Emily was expected to marry a
      man named Law, an "artist in the cheap picture line." This letter seems to
      confirm her marriage in late April or early May 1869. She married a man named
      Edward Law (b. 1844?), an engraver (see <em>United States Census.
         1880.</em>, New York. Brooklyn, Kings). However, another letter from summer
      1869 states that "emmily will be married this fall" (see Louisa's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00171_n6">7. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      refers to Henry Clapp, Jr., (1814–1875), one of Walt Whitman's close
      friends and a leading figure among the bohemians with whom Whitman gathered at
      the Pfaff's restaurant and beer cellar in lower Manhattan. Clapp was the editor
      of a short-lived but influential literary weekly, the <em>New-York
         Saturday Press</em>. For an extended profile of Clapp, see , ed., Edward Whitley.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00171_n18">8. Only the first three
      letters of the word "york" are visible in the image. The letter is pasted into a
      manuscript book, and the final letters on the edge closest to the binding in the
      page image are often obscured. Most of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman manuscript
      letters in the bound volume entitled <em>Walt Whitman: A Series of
         Thirteen Letters from His Mother to Her Son</em>, held at the Harry Ransom
      Center, have obscured text on at least one page. Text from this page was
      recorded based on an examination of the physical volume, which allowed more text
      to be recovered.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00171_n10">9. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      wrote "i beleive thats name" in reference to "lessee farlands." The word
      "lessee" may be a name, but it could also refer to the proprietor of the
      boarding house. The <em>Brooklyn Directory</em> (1871) lists two
      close names that may be boarding houses, a widow Ann Farlan and a clerk Matthew
      Farlands, and the directory lists thirty-five surnames from "McFarlan" through
      "McFarlane." The term "lessee" usually refers to the tenant, but Thomas Gunn
      Butler also used it to refer to a proprietor, which may indicate its currency to
      refer to tenants in Brooklyn slang (<em>The Physiology of New York
         Boarding-Houses</em> [New York: Mason, 1854], 117). In another letter about
      Clapp in connection with Helen Price, Louisa wrote that he was at or going to
      "falanks, Jersey" (see her  letter
      to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00171_n12">10. Walt Whitman said of Clapp,
      "Poor fellow, he died in the gutter—drink—drink—took him down,
      down" (Horace Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.148.html">Wednesday, July 8, 1891</a>, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [New York: Rowan and Littlefield, 1961], 8:312).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">11. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00575_n9">12. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
      adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
      he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
      St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Jeff
      Whitman. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta "Hattie"
      (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" (b. 1863). In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to join Jeff after he had assumed the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in 1867. For more on Mattie, see
      the introduction to Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r12">[back]
