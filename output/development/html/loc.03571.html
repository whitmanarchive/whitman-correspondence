   </p>
   
   <p> I have been too long in acknowledging the receipt of a
      newspaper containing the short poem about the Arctic singing bird.<sup><a href="#med.00762_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> It is really a thing to give thanks for—a piece of
      verse that shows poetry at its greatest. Would it be too great a favour to ask for,
      if I begged you to let me have it in your own handwriting? 
   </p>
   
   <p> I suppose D<u>r</u> Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> sent you a letter I wrote him about D<u>r</u> Karl
      Knortz<sup><a href="#uva.00476_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; his judgment on my translation, which
      letter I asked him to forward to you. Since then I wrote to D<u>r</u> K. explaining my views,
      and asking him if he would revise the M.S. without impairing its literality. I have
      not yet had an answer to this proposal. If he would take it up in the manner I
      suggest a really good thing might be made of it. I should earnestly like to see it
      fairly afloat &amp; before the public in Deutschland. 
   </p>
   
   <p> We are settled now pro tem in the County Wicklow  on the lower slopes of the Wicklow
      mountains &amp; about two miles from the sea, which we have a good view of from the
      windows. We are within easy reach, by train, of Dublin. Which is advantageous for
      me
      as I am coming forward in the political line &amp; belong to the Dublin Young
      Ireland Society<sup><a href="#loc.03571_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup>. Our President, John O'Leary,<sup><a href="#loc.03571_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> is a splendid fellow—a lion-like old man with long
      full grey beard, jet black 20 years ago, when he was sent to penal servitude for the
      Fenian rising in '65.<sup><a href="#loc.03571_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> He was released after 6 years on
      condition of not returning to Ireland till '85. He is now trying to instil a
      spirit of toleration with the rather narrow and bitter patriotism of the National
      League. He and O'Donovan Rossa<sup><a href="#loc.03571_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup> were fellow prisoners! so
      strangely do men's paths diverge. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I wonder if you have seen Irving act.<sup><a href="#loc.03571_n5" id="r8">8</a></sup> I used to admire
      him very much, &amp; hear he has improved lately. I have seen his Hamlet 12
      times—and each time with new interest.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="uva.00476_n1">3. Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="loc.03571_n1">4. Young Ireland was an Irish
      nationalist movement. Originating in the 1830s, it garnered a strong base in
      Dublin and had a lasting influence on subsequent separatist endeavors.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03571_n2">5. John O'Leary
      (1830–1907) was an Irish separatist who had been involved in the 1848
      Young Ireland uprising in the village of Ballingarry, South Tipperary, and was
      exiled in 1871. W. B. Yeats famously memorialized him with the line "Romantic
      Ireland's dead and gone; it's with O'Leary in the grave" ("September
      1913").<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03571_n3">6. Rolleston is likely
      referring to the Fenian Rising of 1867, a short-lived Irish nationalist revolt
      in Ireland as well as Canada. Its leaders were later executed by Great Britian
      and became known as the "Manchester Martyrs."<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="loc.03571_n4">7. Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa
      (1831–1915) was an Irish nationalist leader and activist of the Irish
      Republican Brotherhood. He is perhaps most remembered for the eulogy given by
      Pádraig Pearse upon Rossa's death.<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="loc.03571_n5">8. Sir Henry Irving
      (1838–1905), born John Henry Brodribb, was a well-known British stage
      actor and inspiration for Bram Stoker's <em>Dracula</em>. Both
      Stoker (1847–1912) and Irving visited Whitman in Camden in 1884, where the actor and
      Whitman talked "a good while and seemed to take to each other mightily" (Thomas
      Donaldson, <em>Walt Whitman the Man</em> [New York: Francis P.
      Harper, 1896], 55).<a href="#r8">[back]
