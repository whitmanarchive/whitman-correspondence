      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I wrote you a few days since about Mattie</p>
   
   <p>The next day I saw in one of the papers here that you were confined to your room with
      sickness—is this true?<sup><a href="#loc.00462_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I have written mother again this morning—there is no particular change in Mattie—I
      have been able to take her out for about an hour's drive for the last three days—this
      helps her more than anything else
   </p>
   
   <p>In writing you I spoke to you about coming on—I also mentioned it to Mother—since
      then I have wondered if—supposing you to feel pretty good—you could'nt come by way of Philadelphia and bring Mother with you &nbsp;Mat seems to want to see you
      two so very very much
   </p>
   
   <p>I will write or telegraph you if any change occurs before I hear from you</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00462_n1">1. In the "Personal"
      column for February 4, 1873, the <em>Missouri Republican</em>
      tersely noted, "Walt Whitman is ill with paralysis." Walt Whitman's sad letter
      of February 8 made clear both his affection for Mattie and the serious nature of
      his illness: "Dear, dear, dear, sister Matty—O how I have been thinking of you,
      &amp; shall all day—I have not now the use of my limbs to move from one room to
      the other—or else I should come on immediately to St. Louis...Your unhappy,
      sorrowful, loving brother" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961-77],
      2:196).<a href="#r1">[back]
