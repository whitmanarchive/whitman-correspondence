      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, I am sitting here in the parlor again writing my weekly letter—as I write, the
      rain is pouring &amp; it is a thick &amp; dark day enough—I am feeling pretty bad, but it
      seems to be mostly from a severe cold in the head—anyhow I am having one of my bad
      spells, of which I have gone through so many—had a bad night last night—but have eat
      my breakfast this morning, &amp; have no doubt 
      I shall feel better before many days. Pete, I rec'd your letter &amp; the Herald 
      last Monday all right. Did Mr &amp; Mrs. Nash get the 3 Graphics I sent them?—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been out most every day the past week, &amp; been across the river to Philadelphia—it
      has been a very pleasant week, &amp; I have enjoyed sailing across the Delaware, 
      &amp; the splendid sunsets most every evening—it is my greatest enjoyment—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Pete, all you write about folks &amp; things in Washington is interesting to me—it will
      be read, every thing you scratch down, as I sit here a great deal of the time, 
      (&amp; time is dull &amp; lonesome, at the best)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My pieces I have written (I believe I mentioned about it,) have not yet appeared 
      in the Magazine<sup><a href="#loc.01627_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—but the money has been paid me for them, &amp; they are in type, &amp; I have read the proofs—I
      will either send them to you, when printed, or send you word, so you can get them
      yourself—Did I send you <u>both</u> my letters about the Capitol in the <u>Graphic</u>?<sup><a href="#loc.01627_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I believe I did, but if not I can yet—I send you to-day's Phil. <u>Press</u>—nothing special in it—Well, good bye for this time, dear loving boy,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p>
   
    
   
   <p>Pete, how about running on here to see me for a day or two?—Couldn't you come, 
      convenient, say latter part of next week? If you can, I will fix the time—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
