   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman began his correspondence with
      soldier Byron Sutherland on . In
      April 1870, Sutherland was teaching in Jamestown, N. Y. In reply to Walt
      Whitman's request for further information about his life, the former soldier
      observed on : "You remember me in
      1865 a green vain(?) lad of Eighteen—without, even, an imperfect knowledge of
      the rudimentary English branches, I came home from Washington and applied
      myself, as soon as possible, to school and to study . . . My life since we
      parted that July day upon the Treasury steps, has been one of hard work and
      little recreation—I find on looking back to that time, that I am not so pure or
      trusting—that the world isint quite so fair and beautiful as it seemed then—That
      the world is not precisely a green pasture for unsophistocated human lambs to
      skip in—That I like dreaming less, and work or excitement better—That I have
      lost a great deal of Ambition, and gained a like quantity of stupidity— That I
      dont know nearly so much as I once supposed I did."
