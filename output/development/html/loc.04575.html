      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>For the last two weeks I have been expecting to hear from you every day, and I did
      hope to have seen you before this time.<sup><a href="#loc.04575_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> A week ago I supposed that you had gone East but as I have not received a copy of
      "Leaves of Grass" from you I now begin to think that perhaps you have not got on as
      well as you expected and that you are still ill in St Louis.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If this is the case it may be that you are short of money—if you are and will let
      me I will gladly send you a hundred dollars.<sup><a href="#loc.04575_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> This you may look upon as a loan (to be paid by ten copies of "Leaves of Grass"),
      or a gift, or (more justly) as a small instalment of the infinitely greater debt than that which I owe you. In any case, look at it
      as you please, I hope you will not refuse to take the money if you have any [illegible] need of it at all.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Could I be of any use to you there I will ask at once for a weeks leave of absence
      (which I know I can get) and go at once to St Louis
   </p>

      I am affectionately yours

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04575_n2">1. On , Whitman had written Bucke from
      St. Louis: "Have been absent from Camden the last five weeks—been over the
      Plains &amp; up in the Rock Mountains—gave out about two weeks ago &amp;
      have been quite sick ever since (principal trouble with my head) but am
      recovering—only received yours (of Sept 22) today—will send the book
      from Camden as soon as I get back—shall stay here twelve days WW."<a href="#r1">[back]

      Bucke of November 12, 1879, declining the money is listed as lost (<em>Walt Whitman: The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland
      Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 3:433).<a href="#r2">[back]
