      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The days go along with me pretty much after the old sort, though I 
      dont
      
       get my strength yet, nor feel as well as I did in the fall &amp; early
      winter—I busy myself writing some &amp; reading a little—am doing quite
      well with my books, &amp; have been all winter—when the weather permits I try
      to get out, but my strength soon fails me—has been so now five or six weeks
      &amp; gets no better, but I am in hopes things will take a turn—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Has been a pleasant Sunday here, coolish but sunny and calm—O how I wished I
      could put in the whole day down at G—but I think of coming down next Friday to
      stay two or three days at any rate—a friend of mine here about my age, died
      suddenly yesterday, Judge Woodhall—I thought him the best man in
      Camden—do you know Mrs Gilchrist has been very sick indeed, five or six
      months? &amp; is not over it yet—I got a long letter from her last
      week—Susan I am afraid this is not a very lively letter—I have just had
      my supper, &amp; feel as well as usual, &amp; have no trouble particular to worry me, but I
      am sitting here up in my room alone, &amp; have been all day, &amp; feel kind of
      dull &amp; companionless—
   </p>
   
   <p>Susan I suppose you got the letter I sent you about
      twelve days ago—I also sent one to Harry about a week ago which he has not
      yet acknowledged—Well it is ½ past 8, &amp; the moon is shining, &amp; I
      will go out &amp; put this miserable letter in the box, &amp; then take a few
      minutes walk around, &amp; see if it makes me feel any livelier—How is George
      getting along?—Harry told me he was having a pretty good
      winter—has he drunk up the little bottle of Whiskey? Well there wasn't more
      than two or three good drinks any how—I shall be down next Friday in the
      4½ afternoon train to Kirkwood, if it don't storm pretty bad
   </p>
