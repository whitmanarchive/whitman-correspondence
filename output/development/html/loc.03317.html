   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.03317_n2">2. The two Rhys-letters that
      Whitman is referring to are not extant. In his  letter to Whitman, Rhys writes: "Your letter of the 15th with the
      'Additional Note' was not long in following the other."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00797_n1">3. This is referring to
      Whitman's lecture entitled "The Death of Abraham Lincoln." He first delivered
      this lecture in New York in 1879 and would deliver it at least eight other times
      over the succeeding years, delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He
      had published a version of the lecture as "Death of Abraham Lincoln" in <em>Specimen Days</em> (1882–83). For more on the lecture,
      see Larry D. Griffin, "'Death of Abraham Lincoln,'" <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, ed.,
