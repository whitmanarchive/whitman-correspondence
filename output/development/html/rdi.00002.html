      <br></br><br></br>My dear Dr. Channing:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I yesterday received your kind note. I gladly accept your invitation &amp; hospitality.<sup><a href="#rdi.00002_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> 
      My leave of absence continues for some time yet, &amp; I should probably like to visit
      you 
      for a few days, just subsequently to the middle of October—But I will write you a
      day or two before I come.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send my best respects &amp; love to Mrs. Channing. As I write we are having a rainy,
      
      dark sulky Sunday—after a rainy night. I am well &amp; quietly enjoying holiday.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish you &amp; wife to read my last piece<sup><a href="#rdi.00002_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> in <em>The Broadway</em> 
      London Magazine for October. You can get it at any good bookstand.
