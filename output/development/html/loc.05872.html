      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="loc.07751_n2">3. On January 8, Whitman
      sent "A Death-Bouquet" to Franklin File of the New York <em>Sun</em> for which he received $10 (<em>The
         Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839-1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). See <em>Prose Works 1892</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall, 2 vols. (1963-1964),
      in <em>Collected Writings</em>, 671n. It appeared in the
      Philadelphia <em>Press</em> on February 2. See Whitman's  letter to Bucke.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.00668_n4">4. Frederick Warren Fritzinger
      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,
      535).<a href="#r4">[back]
