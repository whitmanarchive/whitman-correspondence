      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I got your postal of yesterday this morning<sup><a href="#loc.03324_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> and was greatly gratified to hear from
      you. I have wanted badly to write to you for three weeks past, but have really felt
      too sad and anxious to do so, besides being quite crushed with the dead heat we have
      been having, and sick with obstinate bowel trouble and my enfeebling lameness. I
      have felt that you and I were brothers in misfortune—I hope in all other and
      better ways too.
   </p> 
   
   <p>Words cannot tell how badly I feel at your confinement to bed and to the house for
      so
      long, and I enter into the irksomeness of it, combined as it is with
      strengthlessness and general illness. But I hope  the spirit will still surge strong
      in you to resist and endure—it is about all there is for us in life after a
      certain age is reached. My belief in your getting better is invincible, for your
      stamina is indomitable. If you can only get through this hot weather! It is our
      common enemy, and the worst. Everyone appears to be affected by it badly; even the
      
      well, and how much more the ailing!
   </p> 
   
   <p>I had two previous cards from you, one of June 17, and one of June 23.<sup><a href="#loc.03324_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> The proofs
      were read with much pleasure, and despatched to Dr. Bucke,<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> as
      you wished.<sup><a href="#loc.03324_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> I was sorry you left in the one about the Red Emperor,<sup><a href="#loc.03324_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup> but find some
      consolation in the sweet assurance that he is finally damned, and  can trouble the
      earth no more! Many of the pieces are very beautiful, especially the one about the
      nirwana sunset. I think the title very fine.
   </p> 
   
   <p>When you sent the proofs, you wrote that you had been better all day—relieved
      from the prostration, and added that there had been a thunder-storm. See what
      atmosphere does for one! I think another storm is brewing today, and hope so, for
      I
      know it will give you relief.
   </p>
   
   <p>I heard from our all-good Bucke the last of June, and owe him a letter.</p>
   
   <p>I heard recently from Donnelly<sup><a href="#n4108" id="r7">7</a></sup> at London. His book is much
      abused by the English press, as by ours, but in private circles, among  lettered and
      cultivated people, it gains great headway. Dr. Bucke is not convinced (no wonder
      since a part of the secret was withheld.) But I have no doubt that Donnelly has the
      truth and will make his way after a little, especially as the mathematicians back
      him.
   </p>
   
   <p>I don't hear of Kennedy,<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r8">8</a></sup> but hope his book has prospects.
   </p>
   
   <p>Charles Eldridge<sup><a href="#n0210" id="r9">9</a></sup> appears to have won a big law-suit. I daily
      expect to hear from him, and to hear that he has got his fee—a large one.
   </p>
   
   <p>No news here. An even tenor. Nelly<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r10">10</a></sup> is pretty well, though under
      the weather, and sends her love and hopes. Cheer up, Walt, and take all the ease you
      can! I trust you can get out soon, if only for a drive.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03324_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street, | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked:
      Washington, D. C. | Jul 25; 8PM | 88. There is one additional "Camden" postmark,
      but only the name of the city is legible.<a href="#r1">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03324_n2">5. On , Whitman sent O'Connor a twenty-page proof of "Sands at
      Seventy" and asked him to pass the pages on to Dr. Bucke after reading
      them.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03324_n5">6. O'Connor is referring to Whitman's poem "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00113.html">The Dead Emperor</a>," about the death of Emperor Wilhelm I of Germany, who 
      died in March 1888. The poem was published in the <em>New York Herald</em> on March 10, 1888.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4108">7. Ignatius Loyola Donnelly
      (1831–1901) was a politician and writer, well known for his notions of
      Atlantis as an antediluvian civilization and for his belief that Shakespeare's
      plays had been written by Francis Bacon, an idea he argued in his book <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in Shakespeare's
         Plays</em>, published in 1888.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">8. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0210">9. Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">10. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
