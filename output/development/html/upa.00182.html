   <p>Have come back all right from my Canadian trip, &amp; now spending a few days down here<sup><a href="#upa.00182_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—A fine autumn sunny hazy peaceful Sunday—woods, field, sky, delightful—The S[tafford]s
      much as usual—Mrs S quite well—if you were here you would not see any difference from
      over at the Creek—Mr S has had a very fair summer, but is not very rugged—Ed has just
      been home, with his nag, looks fine—M[ontgomery] well, up in Camden—D[ebbie] and J[oseph
      Browning] well, having good times riding about the same as of old—rec'd your paper—
