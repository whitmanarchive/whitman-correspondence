   <p id="syr.00029_n1">1. Whitman also noted the
      "magnificent" review in his Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.). On November 20 he wrote a card of "thanks" to the New York <em>Sun</em> after the appearance of E. P. M.'s lengthy review,
      "Walt Whitman and the Poetry of the Future," on the preceding day (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book). On  Ticknor, of
      Osgood &amp; Co., wrote to Whitman: "The first edition is all gone &amp; we are
      binding up the second."<a href="#r1">[back]
