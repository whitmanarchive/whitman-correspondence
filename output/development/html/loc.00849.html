   <p>Your last letter from Washington in the paper lying on my lap—Your book in the hands
      of my friend Lucy who sits there by the window reading it in the morning sunshine.
      She looks up suddenly and says "I think this is the soul I am waiting for, is Walt
      Whitman married?"  I cannot answer the question, but will you?—I am not interested
      to know if you are married, but I would like to look in your face.  How many years did you live ere you could look into the depths
      of all hearts.  Through what experiences did you learn that lore?  Remember, if ever
      the opportunity comes I will look in your face.  It should say all that is in your
      book and something more.  I want that something more.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Celia M. Burr was a poet,
      literary editor, and a Cincinnati correspondent to the <em>New
         York Tribune</em> in the 1850s. Already divorced, she moved to Troy, New
      York, to serve as secretary and companion to Emma Willard at the Women's
      Seminary. Almost exactly six months after mailing this letter, Burr married a
      third time, to William Henry Burleigh, a writer of Unitarian hymns and then
      harbormaster of New York. After their marriage, Burr became active in the
      women's suffrage movement and, after Burleigh's death in 1871, was ordained as a
      minister in the Unitarian church.
