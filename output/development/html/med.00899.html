   <p> Will write a word as I suppose you are back at B[elmont]—Am greatly disappointed
      at not seeing you here—Horace T is too—but perhaps you will be coming to Phil. for
      two or three days the coming fall or winter—We all like the little "Quaker traits"
      piece—it is a bit of style too, like the happiest songs or pictures--veracity (I hope)
      of the most undeniable, with curious ease, carelessness &amp; impromptude—Yes, I want
      to send a book (or books) to Trans[cript] man (or men) for courtesy in sending me
      paper—It comes promptly &amp; I always read it—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
