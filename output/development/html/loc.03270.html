      R.Worthington
      
       failed some time since and is now unable to do business in his own name,
      and the business is now run by a corporation named the Worthington Co. of which
      Worthington's wife or some female relative is the President. The time within which
      to claim a forfeiture of the plates and books (two years) has run out and we are
      therefore limited to our action for an injunction and damages, I am therefore
      quietly trying to get all the facts I can as to what the "Worthington Co." has been
      doing with reference to your book. The Company is of some responsibility and
      undoubtedly have possession of the plates.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Very little is known about
      Thomas J. McKee, the New York lawyer who was looking into Whitman's claims
      against Richard Worthington for selling unauthorized editions of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860). Whitman forwarded McKee's letter
      to Richard Maurice Bucke on .

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0336">2. John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n1053">3. Richard Worthington was a New York
      printer who published and sold unauthorized editions of Whitman's <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, printed from the plates of the 1860
      edition. Whitman explains his claims against Worthington in his , letter to Richard Watson Gilder.

      of California Press, 2000), 401, and Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
