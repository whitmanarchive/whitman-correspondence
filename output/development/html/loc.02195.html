      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt;
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Painter and picture<sup><a href="#loc.02195_n4" id="r1">1</a></sup> arrived in Hampstead a week ago last Friday without any
      misadventure. The Custom house offices in Liverpool gave me no trouble, and beyond
      paying heavily for overweight luggage from Liverpool to London I experienced no
      difficulty. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Before writing I wanted a few people to see the work. </p>
   
   <p>To begin with, Grace<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r2">2</a></sup> is surprised and pleased with it—the
      picture comes up closely to her recollection of you &amp; she thinks that your
      admirers will be interested and pleased with the portrait. On Sunday  i.e. the day
      before yesterday some dozen literary men &amp; women looked in. Miss Brooke for
      instance (author of "An Heir without a Heritage") thinks you look grand,<sup><a href="#loc.02195_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> and that the picture "emanates" a living personality,
      and that there is a peculiar light and glow about it at all, as though it was
      painted near sundown.
   </p>
   
   <p>Bernard Shawe (a delightful Irishman who reviews books in the <u>Pall Mall</u> cleverly)<sup><a href="#loc.02195_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> it was rather
      dark—late in the afternoon when he arrived, he thought there was a joyous
      spirited look about its execution.—asked me if I was not pleased with it
      myself? 
   </p>
   
   <p>Mrs Arthur Wilson<sup><a href="#loc.02195_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> (a spirited socialist—"what a
      splendid old lion." In fact it is quite evident that the picture  gives people
      quite a new and vivid presentation of your personality here. Buxton Forman<sup><a href="#n0240" id="r6">6</a></sup> wouldn't hear of its being "commonplace" thought Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r7">7</a></sup> remarks about it out of [
      <span class="unclear">a mist?</span>]
       i.e. to try &amp; give 'a youthful fire to the
      eyes.' 
   </p>
   
   <p>Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r8">8</a></sup> took high-tea with us yesterday, he only saw
      it by lamp-light, but Rhys said it gave him a distinctly new, fresh and enlarged
      idea of your personality, &amp; that he was very glad to have seen it before
      starting for America. He intends to start in about 3 weeks time, and thinks that he
      will be in Camden about the middle of November. I have asked him to call on Talcott
      Williams,<sup><a href="#nyp.00459_n4" id="r9">9</a></sup> perhaps you will give him a "leg up" among
      newspaper men? He is going out in a cargoe-boat, so  I should fear that he will be
      pitched and rolled about a good deal.
   </p>
   
   <p>I had a smooth passage across except the last two or three days when it was quite
      rough. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I look back upon my visit to the States with great pleasure—it is a lovely
      country—and I remember the jolly talks &amp; dinners that I've had at your
      house. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I find that your portrait is [
      <span class="unclear">searchingly?</span>]
       carried through and that there is little more to do to
      it—except the hands.
   </p>
   
   <p>Please give my very kind regards to Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n2" id="r10">10</a></sup> &amp; With
      love to Walt.

   <p>Rhys think this work shows more "resource" than anything I have done. I think so
      too.

      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02195_n4">1. Herbert Gilchrist carried
      the original of his painting of Whitman with him back to England, leaving behind
      a copy in the U.S.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0890">2. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02195_n1">3. Emma Frances Brooke
      (1844–1926) was an novelist, poet, and socialist activist.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02195_n2">4. George Bernard Shaw
      (1856–1950) was a Nobel Prize-winning Irish writer, economist, and
      socialist activist. In the late 1880s, he apparently had an affair with Herbert
      Gilchrist's sister Grace.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02195_n3">5. Charlotte M. Wilson
      (1854–1944) was an English Anarchist who edited the newspaper <em>Freedom</em> together with leading anarcho-syndicalist thinker
      Peter Kropotkin. She was married to Arthur Wilson, a stockbroker, and a member
      of the Fabian Society.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0240">6. Henry Buxton Forman (1842–1917) was most
      notably the biographer and editor of Percy Shelley and John Keats. On , Buxton sent a copy of R. H.
      Horne's <em>The Great Peace-Maker; A Sub-marine Dialogue</em>
      (London, 1872) to Whitman. This poetic account of the laying of the Atlantic
      cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death, Forman's reputation
      declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham Pollard and John Carter
      published <em>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth
         Century Pamphlets</em>, which exposed Forman as a forger of many first
      "private" editions of poetry.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">7. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03310_n1">8. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00459_n4">9.  Talcott Williams
      (1849–1928), a journalist, worked for the New York <em>Sun</em> and <em>World</em>, and became an editorial writer
      on the Springfield <em>Republican</em> in 1879. He joined the
      staff of the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in 1881. In 1912 he
      became director of the School of Journalism at Columbia University. See also
      Elizabeth Dunbar's <em>Talcott Williams: Gentleman of the Fourth
         Estate</em> (1936) and Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906), 1:202. The Philadelphia <em>Press</em> vigorously supported the poet against the Boston
      censorship both in its news columns and in its editorials. A front-page story on
      July 15 quoted at length the defense of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      offered by the Reverend James Morrow, "a prominent Methodist."For more
      information on Talcott Williams, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_108.html">Williams, Talcott (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="n0625">11. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r11">[back]
