   <p>The sad news of Boyle O'Reilly's<sup><a href="#n4973" id="r1">1</a></sup> death came just as we were
      blooming out for the [

       celebrat<u>n</u>. It is a marked loss in the
      realm of camaraderie, of noble sympathy + ideal right-heartedness. He was a born
      fighter—O. R. pointed to his crossed swords once + said to me that that was
      the only medicine for Ireland's wrongs. The tall Irishman who escaped with him fr.
      Australia was with him in the room at the time. O R was once cornered into what fr.
      another wd have induced a confession that Ireland had been in the wrong. "Well after
      all, said he, "it is better to be Irish than right."

   <p>It is a thrilling sight to witness this great 
      G. A. R.
      
       reunion of the remnant of the war fellows. Wish you cd have seen 'em. They
      look stout &amp; hale yet—most [
      <span class="unclear">of?</span>]
       'em—strong as you describe 'em in the year '61,
      "sad distracted year" +c. But gray hairs plentiful. How hard to realize that 25 yrs
      have gone since the close of the strife!
   </p>
   
   <p>A noble-looking 
      G. A. R.
      
       man fainted + perhaps eventually died just where I stood. I nearly ruined
      a pair of new trousers jumping over a barbed wire to help him.
   </p>
   
   <p>I walked among 20.000 soldiers on Boston Common—all cheery, strong-handed,
      tanned deeply—yellowish—by Western harvest suns. Gents, band music +c
      +c.
   </p>
   
   <p>'Twas a memorable night, too, to see the scores of trains from the great West
      sidetracked at the railway stations—great strip-labels on each
      train—"Wisconsin" "Detroit," "Post" so + so. The trains came thro' unbroken western
      road cars—
   </p>
   
   <p>This reunion is to me next best to seeing the army as you saw it.</p>
   
   <p>So glad you're so cheerful. Mrs K says to me "Always send my love when you write to
      Walt W." She was extremely pleased with the sweet simplicity of Mrs Costelloe's<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> letter.
   </p>
   
   <p>I agree with you as to Symonds'<sup><a href="#n0615" id="r3">3</a></sup> books in general: they are
      unutterably dull + [illegible],—[illegible]. I shant see the "Essays,
      Suggestive" for a little while probably.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4973">1. John Boyle O'Reilly
      (1844–1890) was a fervent Irish patriot who joined the British Army in
      order to sabotage it. He was arrested and sentenced to be hanged in 1866. Later
      the decree was altered, and O'Reilly was sent to Australia, where he escaped on
      an American whaler in 1869. In 1876 he became the coeditor of the Boston <em>Pilot</em>, a position which he held until his death in 1890.
      See William G. Schofield, <em>Seek for a Hero: The Story of John
         Boyle O'Reilly</em> (New York: Kennedy, 1956). For more on O'Reilly, see

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">2. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="n0615">3. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
