      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The papers with 
      Prof:
      
       Young's speech came safely &amp; I read it, my hand in
      yours, happy and full of interest.—Are you getting on my Darling? When I know
      that you no longer suffer from distressing sensations in the head &amp; can move
      without such effort and difficulty a hymn of thankfulness will go up from my heart.
      Perhaps this week I shall  get the paper with the line on it that is to tell me so
      much— or at least that you are well on your way towards it.—And what
      shall I tell you about? The quiet tenor of our daily lives here? but that is very
      restricted, though I trust as far as it goes, good &amp; healthful. Or the thoughts
      and hopes that leap from across the ocean &amp; the years? But they hide themselves
      away when I want to put them into words. Do not think I live in dreams. I know very
      well it is strictly in 
      proportion as the present &amp; the past have been busy shaping &amp; preparing the
      materials of a beautiful future, that it really will be beautiful when it comes to
      exist as a present, seeing how it needs must be entirely a growth from all that has
      preceded it &amp; that there are no sudden creations of flowers of happiness in men
      &amp; women any more than in the fields. But if the buds lie ready  folded ah what the
      sunshine will do! What fills me with such deep joy in your poems is the sense of the
      large complete acceptiveness—the full &amp; perfect faith in
      humanity—<u>in every individual unit of humanity</u>
      thus for the first time uttered. That alone satisfies the sense of justice in the
      soul, responds to what its own nature compels it to believe of the Infinite Source
      of all. That too includes within its scope the lot as well  as the man. His infinite, undying self
      must achieve and fulfil itself out of any &amp; all experiences. Why if it takes
      such ages &amp; such vicissitudes to compact a bit of rock—fierce heat, &amp;
      icy cold, storms deluges, crushing pressure &amp; slow subsidences as if it were
      like a handful of years &amp; all sunshine would do for a man!— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dec. 18</p>
   
   
   <p>The longed for paper has come to hand. O it <u>is</u> a  slow struggle back to
      health my Darling! I believe in the main it is good news that is come—and
      there is the little stroke I wanted so on the address. But for all that I feel
      troubled &amp; conscious—for I believe you have been a great deal worse since
      you wrote—and that you have still such a steep steep hill to climb. Perhaps if
      my hand were in yours dear Walt, you would get  along faster—Dearer and sweeter
      that lot than even to have been your bride in the full flush &amp; strength and
      glory of your youth. I turn my face to the westward sky before I lie down to sleep,
      deep &amp; steadfast within me the silent aspiration that every year, every month
      &amp; week may help something to prepare and make fitter me and mine to be your
      comfort and joy. We are full of imperfections shortcomings but half developed, but
       half "possessing
      our own souls." But we grow, we learn we strive—that is the best of us. I
      think in the sunshine of your presence we shall grow fast I too, my years
      notwithstanding May the New Year lead you out into the sunshine again—shed out
      of its days health &amp; strength so that you tread the earth in gladness again.
      This, with love from us all.

      Good bye dearest Friend

   <p>Herby was at a Conversation last night where
      were many distinguished men &amp; beautiful women. Among the works of art
      displayed on the walls was a fine photograph of you. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>19th, afternoon.</p>
   
   
   <p>And now a later post has brought me the other 
      No.
      
       of the Graphic with your own writing in it—so full of life and
      spirit so fresh &amp; cheerful &amp; vivid dear Friend it seems to scatter all
      anxious sad thoughts to the winds. And are you then really back at Washington I
      wonder or have you only visited  it in spirit, &amp; written the recollection of former
      evenings. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall have none but cheerful thoughts now. I shall reread it
      carefully—read it to the young folk at tea tonight.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
