      <br></br><br></br>Dear Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I read with great concern the statement in your note of 20 
      Octr
      
       that you are "in poorer health even than of late seasons": it 
      wd.
      
       give me &amp; others the sincerest pleasure to receive pretty soon a
      statement to the reverse effect.<sup><a href="#loc.03609_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p> Since I wrote last to you little sums have been accumulating in my hands:<sup><a href="#loc.03609_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I enclose an account of them, amounting to
      ￡31.19—  Within the next few days I shall take the usual steps for postal
      remittance of this amount, &amp; will send you the papers. 
   </p>
   
   <p> In the letter of Miss L. Agnes Jones to me (more especially) there are some
      expressions 
      wh.
      
       I think you will be pleased to read. I don't know this lady: she writes
      from 16 Nevern Road, Earl's Court, London. "The necessities of persons one knows,
      &amp; may be bound to do all one can for, are so near &amp; pressing that to give
      money to help—on the efforts of those who try to realize one's ideals is
      seldom possible; &amp;, even in sign of one's gratitude to one who has partly
      reformed our ideals,  is less so. . . . Yet Walt Whitman 
      shd.
      
       have those: to whom it is at once instinct &amp; natural inevitable duty
      not to count any cost, or weigh this claim with that; but to break the alabaster,
      &amp; pour the ointment, with no thought but of <u>him</u>. Has
      he not? This is a long apology for sending 5/-: it seemed so poor &amp;
      ungenerous to send, unless I had said what gratitude it may yet stand for. Walt
      Whitman knows better than most that the sense of spiritual gain can seldom find the
      expression it longs for; &amp; that it may forever remain unexpressed in material
      terms, &amp; yet be present &amp; abiding. I have as often wished to thank him." 
   </p>
   
   <p> I grieve to say that Mrs. Gilchrist  has been much out of health of
      late, &amp; I fear still continues so.<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r4">4</a></sup> No doubt you have
      details from head quarters.

      Yours in reverence &amp; affection,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.03609_n3">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle St. | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is postmarked:
      LONDON W.[illegible] | NO12 | 85 | S.M.P.; NEW YORK | NOV | 21 |

   <p id="loc.03609_n1">2. Whitman's prior letter is
      not extant and in his reply to Rossetti of , he has little positive to say about his health: "nothing new
      with me, only my eyesight is better."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03609_n2">3. Rossetti is referring to the
      funds that he and Herbert Gilchrist had been raising in England to support
      Whitman. For more on this "free-will offering" see Anne Gilchrist's letter to

   <p id="n0259">4. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
