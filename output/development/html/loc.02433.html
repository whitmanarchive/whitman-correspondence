      <br></br><br></br>Dear Uncle Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I did not imagine that so many days would have flown by before I informed you of the
      great joy that came to us all on the twenty-second of January, when our dear
      Grace<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r3">3</a></sup> received the sweet dignity of Motherhood. The baby
      came to our world of strife under just such
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>conditions as would rejoice your heart. Ideal physical conditions, perfect mental
      and
      spiritual equilibrium in the pure hearted Mother, have given the dear little baby
      girl such a start in life as I wish were possible for every human being—the
      little one will surely be a power for good in the future. Just now however, she
      makes a noise in the world very similar to that by which other tiny infants make
      known their wants. Grace herself is just lovely and with her baby by her side is a
      subject such as would have inspired a Raphael. Frances Alma is to be the little
      one's name. The "Frances" is in honor of Mama<sup><a href="#loc.02433_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>, May<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r5">5</a></sup>, and the eleven year old Franklin<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r6">6</a></sup> whose
      birthday is also on the twenty-second. "Alma" is after dear Mother<sup><a href="#n3029" id="r7">7</a></sup>, of course. The children are all as proud as can be of the
      newcomer, and the acme of happiness is reached when allowed to hold the little mass
      of "unlocated sensation."
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Friday night we had the great pleasure of listening to a fine analysis of the
      writings (or rather meaning of the writings) and the influence of Thomas Paine. The
      lecturer was Edward King<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r8">8</a></sup>, the Little Giant. Moncure R.
      Conway<sup><a href="#n0170" id="r9">9</a></sup>, Father<sup><a href="#n0336" id="r10">10</a></sup>, George Francis
      Train<sup><a href="#loc.02433_n4" id="r11">11</a></sup> and others spoke afterwards. Mr. King laid
      special emphasis on the fact that Paine, spite of his iconoclastic flaws was
      constructive, sympathetic rather than destructive. That his aim was to replace
      superstition with a religion based on facts that are
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>to be deduced from ever present phenomena of the physical and moral worlds. The
      courage and steadfastness of the man, shown by his taking a stand in opposition to
      his friends even, when conscience required it, were dwelt upon. And oh, to think of
      an ungrateful country! I wonder if there is a school history in the country that
      gives the least hint of what we owe to the efforts of Thomas Paine in behalf of the
      liberties of man. I am sorry I have
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>no newspaper clippings to send you—Mr. Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r12">12</a></sup> too would
      have greatly enjoyed the evening as he is an admirer of Paine. I hope he reached
      Camden alive. New York must seem to him a very inhospitable place for his train was
      run into just as the city was reached and when he left, it was after a very slim
      breakfast.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We see Emma [
      <span class="unclear">Frag
         Jenks?</span>]
      <sup><a href="#n5000" id="r13">13</a></sup> quite often. She is like a bit of sunshine,
      and her husband is a fine young fellow. What we particularly appreciate in him is
      that on Tuesday nights he is willing to have her attend our Society for Political
      Study and then at ten o'clock he comes after her, which every young husband might
      not be willing to do. She does such pretty work in water-colors—.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish you could have a glimpse of our boys' playroom. At first glance it is
      "confusion worse confounded"<sup><a href="#loc.02433_n5" id="r14">14</a></sup> but when viewed in detail
      it resolves itself
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>into four little domains—Harold's, Franklin's, Calder's and Edwin's. At one
      time soldiers strew the battle-fields—again the tooting of the locomotive is
      heard, or the shouts of Stanley<sup><a href="#loc.02433_n6" id="r15">15</a></sup> and his men—as
      they plunge through Darkest Africa—and the agonies those small boys endure if
      perchance a rustling skirt should ruin a little settlement.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother has just read me some words of John Swinton<sup><a href="#n0611" id="r16">16</a></sup> taken from
      to-day's Sun in which he recalls a day spent with you in the hospitals and expresses
      his appreciation of all you were to your beloved soldiers—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>All send much love—</p>

   <p id="n0336">10. John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about

   <p id="n4267">12. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

   <p id="n0611">16. John Swinton (1829–1901), a journalist and
      friend of Karl Marx, became acquainted with Whitman during the Civil War.
      Swinton, managing editor of the <em>New York Times</em>,
      frequented Pfaff's, where he probably met Whitman. Whitman's correspondence with
      Swinton began on . Swinton's
      enthusiasm for Whitman was unbounded. On , Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly impressed with the great
      humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you. I read this afternoon in
      the book. I read its first division which I never before read. I could convey no
      idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more to me than all other books and
      poetry." On , Swinton wrote what
      the poet termed "almost like a love letter": "It was perhaps the very day of the
      publication of the first edition of the 'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of
      it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street, Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it
      with wonder, and felt that here was something that touched on depths of my
      humanity. Since then you have grown before me, grown around me, and grown into
      me" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.13.html">Tuesday, April 10, 1888</a>). He praised Whitman in the <em>New York Herald</em> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke,
      <em>Walt Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
      36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
      for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <em>New York Sun</em>, and for the next four years edited the
      weekly labor journal, <em>John Swinton's Paper</em>. When this
      publication folded, he returned to the <em>Sun</em>. See Robert
      Waters, <em>Career and Conversations of John Swinton</em>
      (Chicago: C.H. Kerr, 1902), and Meyer Berger, <em>The History of
         The New York Times, 1851–1951</em> (New York: Simon and Schuster,
