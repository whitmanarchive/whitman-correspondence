      <br></br><br></br>Dear JB
      
   </p>  
   
   <p>Nothing very special with me—bad enough yet and imprison'd in the room and
      chair, but easier and freer of the intestinal and bladder troubles and fearful
      weakness of ten weeks ago—At present I am sitting by the oak fire in my big
      chair, well protected—as it is bitter cold the last two days and now
      here—
   </p>
   
   <p>The news from O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup> is bad, and worse—he is confined to
      the house and seems to be failing. . . . Most probably I shall continue ab't the
      stage I am at present—maybe some time, but the future will eventuate itself,
      and it will of course be all right. I continue almost totally disabled from getting
      around, can hardly get across the room—have a good stout nurse, Ed Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r2">2</a></sup> f'm Canada—no serious pain in particular—good heart
      yet—eat and sleep fairly—so you see it is not so bad as might
      be—(and perhaps will be yet)—
   </p>
   
   <p>I enclose a piece you might like to see<sup><a href="#med.00862_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Dr
      B[ucke]<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> is expected here in a week or ten days—I
      suppose you hear f'm Horace Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r5">5</a></sup> and that keeps you posted.
      H. T. has been and is invaluable to me—my books are all printed etc. (I have a
      big book, complete poems and prose<sup><a href="#n4195" id="r6">6</a></sup> for you)—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n2002">1. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">2. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00862_n2">3. The piece Whitman refers
      to is likely a copy of Kennedy's translation of Gabriel Sarrazin's "Poetes
      modernes de l'Amerique, Walt Whitman," which had appeared in <em>La Nouvelle Revue</em>, 52 (May 1, 1888), 164–184. Whitman had asked
      both Kennedy and Richard Maurice Bucke to make an abstract in English of it (see
      Whitman's letter to Kennedy of ,
      and to Bucke of ). Sarrazin's
      piece is reprinted in an English translation by Harrison S. Morris in <em>In Re</em> (pp. 159–94). Sarrazin (1853–1935) was
      a translator and poet from France, who commented positively not only on
      Whitman's work but also on Poe's. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino,
      "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 609.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">5. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4195">6. Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), a volume Whitman often referred to
      as the "big book," was published by Philadelphia publisher David McKay in
      December 1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, he made the presswork and
      binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the book, which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more information on
      the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0892">7. Ursula North Burroughs
      (1836–1917) was John Burroughs's wife. Ursula and John were married on
      September 12, 1857. The couple maintained a small farm overlooking the Hudson
      River in West Park, Ulster County. They adopted a son, Julian, at two months of
      age. It was only later revealed that John himself was the biological father of
      Julian.<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="loc.01151_n1">8. Julian Burroughs
      (1878–1954), the only son of John and Ursula Burroughs, later became a
      landscape painter, writer, and photographer.<a href="#r8">[back]
