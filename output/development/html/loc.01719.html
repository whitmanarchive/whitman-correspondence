      <br></br><br></br>My dear Dan Gilette,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.01719_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your kind letter—with that of your English friend Chrissie Deschamps, (so full of
      kindness 
      &amp; affectionate sympathy, plainly enough from the heart, &amp; not conventional merely)—have
      reached me to-day. I am getting along pretty well. It seems to be a fluctuating 
      &amp; pretty stout struggle between my general physique &amp; constitution, &amp; my special 
      cerebral ailment—in which I think the physique will yet carry the day.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My best regards &amp; love to you, my friend, &amp; to my English friends the same.

   <p>Dan, it is very lonesome to me here, I go out hobbling a little, but to no satisfaction,
      
      although I am very comfortably fixed in domestic matters. Write to me when you can,
      
      send me any stray printed thing you are sure might interest me, or if you come 
      Philadelphiaward come &amp; see me.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>According to the New York Directory of
      1874–1875 and the Gouldings Directory of 1877–1878, Daniel G.
      Gillette was a clerk in the county courthouse. An undated entry in one of
      Whitman's address books (The Library of Congress #108) indicates that Gillette
      was at one time employed in the postmaster's office in New York.
