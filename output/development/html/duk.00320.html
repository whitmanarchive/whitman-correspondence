      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just received your letter of June 4th and hope you will write me oftener, I
      sent you a letter containing five dollars 5 or 6 days ago which I supose you received &nbsp; I also sent you thirty dollars by Adams Express. Please write if you
      received it all right. Everything here remains quiet, &nbsp;I am perfectly well and get
      along first rate. The Captain of our company<sup><a href="#duk.00320_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> has a Wife, staying at his Brothers in Burlington Vermont, &nbsp;he has writen to her saying I had a Sister there, and asking her to call and see her, &nbsp;he received
      a letter to night from his wife saying, that she had been there two or three times
      &nbsp;once Han and Heyde were out &nbsp;the next time she saw Heyde who said that he and Han
      would call and see her, &nbsp;this was a Month or 6 weeks ago, &nbsp;She says in her letter that Han has never called and I am quite certain that Heyde
      never told Han any thing about Mrs Francis, calling, or she would have went to see
      her, as she could have heard from me every week. Mrs. Francis also says that she has
      heard from some of Hans friends that Heyde does not treat her very well but she wrote
      for him not to say any thing about that to me.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother I wish you would write to Han asking her to come home and if she wants money
      to come home with &nbsp; I will send it to her &nbsp;I want her to come very much &nbsp;if I could
      get away I would go myself to Burlington on purpose to give that little Cuss Heyde
      a good square kicking.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother dont fail to write to Han immediately and try and get her to come home and stay. If you think it would be better for Walt to go on there and see
      how things are I will send him some money if he will go, and then he can bring Han
      back if things are as we susspect.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother you dont say any thing about your cold in the letter I got to night so I hope you are entirely
      over it. So Bunkum has gone Sogering too has he,<sup><a href="#duk.00320_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> well they will have good times in Baltimore for it seems to me this war is about
      played out, &nbsp;I have been rather doubtful about Corinth<sup><a href="#duk.00320_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> but it seems Halleck has cleared them out of there, and if Mac,<sup><a href="#duk.00320_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> does the clean thing at Richmond I dont see what hope will be left them
   </p>
   
   <p>I told you in my last letter of the splendid present the boys of our company made
      me &nbsp;I am very proud of it I tell you &nbsp;We have had a couple of as pretty flags as I ever saw presented to the Regt &nbsp;one by the Ladies of New York and one by the
      City. &nbsp;The New York Comon Concill when they appropriated the money for the flag they gave us said something about our
      exchanging (the flag that we have carried ever since we left New York) for the new
      one, &nbsp;the Colonel one day when the Regt was out on drill, stated the case to the Boys
      and asked if they would exchange, &nbsp;the boys let up such a yell as convinced the Colonel
      that the City would have a good time getting that old Flag. It has 15 or 20 bullet
      holes in it and the staff was shot into at Newbern, and we think a great deal of it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well Mother I beleive that is all all I have got to say. So good night and Much Love to all</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00320_n1">1. Morris Hazard, Jr. was
      captain of Company D until his discharge from the army on May 7, 1862.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00320_n2">2. This is George's first of
      three direct references (see George Washington Whitman's
      letters to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from
      , and ) to the soldiering of his brother Andrew. It still
      remains a mystery whether Andrew Whitman ever entered military service. An
      inquiry to the Bureau of National Archives produced the reply that George
      Whitman was the only brother of Walt Whitman fighting in the Civil War
      (Katherine Molinoff, <em>Monographs on Unpublished Whitman
         Material</em> [Brooklyn, New York: Comet Press, 1941], 18–19).
      Further, a similar query by the editor to the New York Division of Military and
      Naval Affairs in Albany also failed to uncover the name of Andrew Whitman. Yet
      in a letter from Walt Whitman to Lewis Kirk
      Brown from , Walt Whitman wrote that Andrew "too was a
      soldier."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00320_n4">4. General George Brinton
      McClellan (1826–1885) was General-in-Chief of the Army of the United
      States from November 1861, until July 1862, when he was replaced by General
      Henry W. Halleck. In 1864, when McClellan ran for the presidency, the Democratic
      party split between war Democrats and peace Democrats. To satisfy the war
      Democrats McClellan was nominated; to satisfy the peace Democrats C. L.
      Vallandigham and his followers were allowed to draft the platform. Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman evidently considered the entire Democratic party as "the peace
      party" as evidenced from the letter to his brother Walt dated .<a href="#r4">[back]
