      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours 
      rec'd—I am now back here finishing up—only 
      stayed
      
       a few days in Concord, but they were 
      mark'd
      
       days. Sunday, Emerson &amp; his wife, son Edward &amp; wife &amp;c. gave
      me a dinner—two hours—every thing just right every way—a dozen
      people there, (the family &amp; relatives)—for my part I thought the old man
      in his smiling and alert quietude &amp; 
      withdrawness—he has a good color in
      the face &amp; ate just as much dinner as any body—more eloquent, grand,
      appropriate &amp; impressive than ever—more indeed than could be
      described—Wasn't it comforting that I have had—in the sunset as it
      were—so many significant affectionate hours with him under such quiet,
      beautiful, appropriate circumstances?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The book is done &amp; will be in the market in a month or so—all about it has
      proceeded satisfactorily—&amp; I have had my own way in every thing—the
      old name "Leaves of Grass" is retained—it will be a $2 book—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall probably go on to New York in about a week—shall stay at Johnston's,
      (address me there Mott avenue &amp; 149th street N Y city) about a week or ten
      days—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Besides this general death-gloom of the nations<sup><a href="#prc.00075_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—have you heard of the sudden &amp; dreadful death of our young friend
      Beatrice Gilchrist in performing some chemical experiment with ether?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Joaquin Miller is here—is with me every day—Longfellow has been to see
      me<sup><a href="#prc.00075_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I have met O W Holmes &amp; old Mr James.<sup><a href="#prc.00075_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
