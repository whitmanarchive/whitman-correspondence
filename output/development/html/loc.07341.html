   <p>I was much pleased this morning to get yours of 
      15<u>th</u><sup><a href="#loc.07341_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> and its enclosures, letter from
      Mrs Costelloe<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; card from Mrs O'C.'<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r4">4</a></sup> Glad enough to see that you are not
      materially worse though I fear no better and no more comfortable. Mrs C<u>s</u> letter is
      most interesting—she seems to have gone neck and crop into politics. What a
      curious thing it is (and how fortunate) that <u>whatever</u> we
      take up with (maybe forced into it) soon becomes (usually at all events) intensely
      interesting to us. I guess Mr<sup><a href="#n6114" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; Mrs Costelloe (and friends) are going to reform
      that old world over there! They will have a whack at it any way and perhaps the
      trying to reform it is as good as the actual reforming would be! I am scratching
      away here about as usual—the chief excitement at present is the question of
      ice, for next summer[.] We have had no winter &amp; have no ice

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">3. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="n4137">4. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
