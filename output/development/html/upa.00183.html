      <br></br><br></br>Dearest friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am having comfortable times down here for me—spend many hours in the open air, though
      it has been furiously blustering the last two days here—&amp; pretty cold—Still it is
      <em>spring</em> here—evidences every way, every day—Much singing of birds, on some of my visits at
      the pond. <em>The Pond</em> I have more joy &amp; comfort from than ever—I shall not be up with you for a week, as
      I am to go down to the sea-shore Saturday with Mr Stafford—(not to stay however)—Hope
      to be with you next week—Will (probably) send you a postal card—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This review of Hugo I cut from a late Weekly ed. <em>London Times</em>—You may have it already, but as also you may not, I send it—Seems to me good—
   </p>

      Love to all—

   <p id="upa.00183_n2">2. Since Walt Whitman was in
      Camden on April 10, 1878, this letter was undoubtedly written in 1877 (The
      Commonplace-Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). He made no entries in
      The Commonplace-Book between April 1 and 24, 1877.<a href="#r2">[back]
