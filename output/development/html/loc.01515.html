      <br xmlns="" class="opener">October 17, '1888
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>According to announcement in my last,<sup><a href="#loc.01515_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I have made a
      movement &amp; change of base from tumultuous close=packed world-like N.Y. to the
      <u>handsome</u>, half=rural, brisk, handsome New England,
      third class town. I came on here last Thursday. I came as guest of Thomas Davis,<sup><a href="#n0187" id="r3">3</a></sup> formerly M.C. from this city—arrived between 8 and 9
      o'clock at night—found his carriage at the depot wait'g for me—at the
      house—a sort of castle built of stone, on fine grounds a mile &amp; a half
      from the town—a hearty welcome from his hospitable wife, &amp; a family of
      young ladies &amp; children—a hot supper, a tip-top room &amp;c. &amp;c. *
      So you see Pete, your old man is in clover. I have since been round the city &amp;
      suburbs [
      <span class="unclear">considerably?</span>]
      . I
      am going down to Newport before I return. * Invitations &amp;c.
      are numerous. I am in fact already dividing myself between two hospitalities, part
      of the time with Mr &amp; Mrs. Davis,<sup><a href="#duk.00617_n15" id="r4">4</a></sup> and part with Dr.
      &amp; Mrs. Channing,<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> old acquaintances of mine in
      another part of the city. I stopt last night at the house of the latter. It is on
      a
      high &amp; pleasant hill at the side of the city, which it entirely overlooks. From
      the window of my room, I can look down across the city, the river, and over off miles
      
      upon miles in the distance. The woods are a real spectacle, colored with all the
      rich colors of autumn. Yesterday it was beautiful &amp; balmy beyond description,
      like the finest Indian summer. I wandered around, partly walking partly in a
      carriage a good part of the day. To-day there is an entire change of
      scenery—As I sit writ'g this, what do you think Pete?—great
      flakes—of <u>snow</u> are fall'g, <u>sometimes</u>
      —the wind
      blows gusts—quite a thick flurry—in fact a real snow=storm has been go'g
      on all the forenoon though without the look &amp; or feeling of winter, as the grass
      &amp; foliage are autumnal, &amp; the cold is not severe yet. Still it disagreeable,
      &amp; wet &amp; dark, &amp; prevents me from going out. So I will make it up by
      writing a couple of letters—one to mother, &amp; one to you [
      <span class="unclear">tell'g?</span>]
       you about things.
      Providence is a handsome city of about 70000 inhabitants—has numerous
      manufactories in full operation—every thing looks lively. From the house up
      here, I can hear almost any time, night or day, the sound of factory bells &amp; the
      steam whistles of locomotives half a mile distant. Then the lights at night seen
      from here make a curious exhibition. At both the places I stop, we have plenty of
      ripe, fresh fruit and lots of flowers. Pete I could now send you a bouquet every
      morn'g, far better than I used to, for much choicer flowers.
   </p>
   
   <p>And how are you gett'g along, dearest comrade? I hope you are well, &amp; that every
      th'g is going on right with you. I have not heard from you for a good while it
      seems. I suppose you got my last letter, 14th from N.Y. I expect to return to N.Y.
      there about the 22d. Should you feel to write after receiving this, you might direct
      to 331 East 55th st. as before. I am well as usual. I am luxuriating on excellent
      grapes. I wish I could send you a basket. At both places I stop they have
      vineyeards, &amp; the grapes are very good &amp; plenty this year. Last night, when
      I went up at 11 o'clock to my room, I took up three great bunches, each as big as
      my
      fist, &amp; sat down and eat them before I turned in. I like to eat them this way,
      &amp; it agrees with me.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is quite a change here from my associations &amp; surroundings either in
      Washington or New York. Evenings, &amp; meal time I find myself thrown amidst a
      mild pleasant society, really intellectual composed largely of educated women, some
      young, some not so young, every thing refined &amp; polite, <u>not</u> disposed to small talk, to convers'g in earnest, on profound subjects,
      but with a
      moderate rather slow tone, &amp; in a kind &amp; conciliatory
      manner—delighting in this sort of conversation &amp; spending their evenings
      in it till late. I take a hand in, for a change. I find it entertaining, as I say
      ,
      for novelty's sake for a week or two—but I know very well that would be enough
      for me. It is all first rate good &amp; smart, but too constrained &amp; bookish for
      a free old hawk like me.
   </p>
   
   <p>I send you my love dear Pete. <u>So</u>
      <u>long</u>. Will write from N.Y. soon as I return there.

   <p>P.S. just after 12 oclock—noon—as I am just finish'g,—the storm
      lightens up—I am sure I see a bit of blue sky in the clouds—yes the
      sun is certainly break'g out.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01515_n1">1. In addition to writing
      "Providence R.I." in the address line, Whitman wrote "Providence" in pen four
      times at the top of this letter, twice vertically and twice horizontally. Also
      at the top of the letter, the poet wrote "9th letter."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01515_n2">2. Whitman crossed out "letter
      of 14th."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0187">3. Thomas Davis (1806–1895) was a manufacturer of
      jewelry in Providence, Rhode Island, and a Democratic representative for that
      state from 1853 to 1855. Whitman stayed at Davis's home in October 1868.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00617_n15">4. Paulina Wright Davis
      (1813–1876) was a noted feminist who presided over the first National
      Woman's Rights Convention. See Sherry L. Ceniza, <em>Walt Whitman
         and 19th-Century Women Reformers</em> (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama
      Press, 1998), 96–139. Wright Davis and her husband Thomas Davis
      (1806–1895), a jewelry manufacturer, resided in Providence, Rhode Island,
      and Walt Whitman had visited them during his October 1868 vacation. Helen Price
      reported that Paulina "is expected home in May" (see her March 27, 1873 letter
      to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman [Trent Collection, Duke University]).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00945_n5">5. William F. Channing
      (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
      Whitman stayed at his home in October, 1868.<a href="#r5">[back]
