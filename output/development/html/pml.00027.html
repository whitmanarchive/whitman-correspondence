      <br></br><br></br>Dear Abby,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall return to New York to-morrow, Thursday<sup><a href="#pml.00027_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—leaving here at ½ past 12, noon, 
      and getting in N. Y. about 8—&amp; intend to go on to Washington on Monday next, 26th.
      
      I have been at the Channings's—Jeannie is quite unwell—but bears it like the heroine
      she is—William O'Connor is there—I am now at Mr. &amp; Mrs. Davis's—Am treated with the
      
      greatest hospitality &amp; courtesy every where. Yesterday Mr. Davis took me out riding—went
      down to Fields' Point, off the bay—&amp; thence to the domain &amp; factories 
      of the Spragues,<sup><a href="#pml.00027_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; so to Olneysville &amp;c &amp;c—as interesting a ride 
      &amp; exploration as I ever had in my life—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have seen Mrs. Whitman<sup><a href="#pml.00027_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—&amp; like her. We had yesterday here to dinner &amp; spend 
      the evening Nora Perry,<sup><a href="#pml.00027_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Wm O'Connor, Dr. Channing, &amp;c—To-day Mrs. Davis had 
      intended to take me out riding, but it is threatening rain, wind east, &amp; skies dark—So
      it will have to be given up. I like Mr. Davis much. I am very glad I made 
      this jaunt &amp; visit—Love to you, Helen, Emily, &amp; all.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Abby H. Price
      (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
      husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
      children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
      age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
      were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
      Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for
      the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother in <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 (1908): 163–169. In a letter to Ellen M.
      O'Connor from , Whitman declared
      with emphasis, "<em>they are all friends</em>, to prize and love
      deeply."

      , O'Connor, who was a close
      friend of Sarah Helen Whitman, transcribed some of her comments in a letter to
      Walt Whitman: "The great, the good Camerado! The lover of men!…How strange
      it seems to me now that I should have been so near him without knowing him
      better! How many questions that I asked you about him would have needed no
      answer, if I had but have read his book then as I have read it now."<a href="#r4">[back]
