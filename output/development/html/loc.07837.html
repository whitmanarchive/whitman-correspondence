      Phila:<sup><a href="#loc.07837_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup>—there is some opposition to me or my

      freethinking folks more intense in identifying this WW affair with mark'd
      freethinking and non-orthodox (almost) passion—all of wh' is annoying to
      me—But I let the current move as it will or may, &amp; shall not
      meddle—but there are items ab't it that are not acceptable to me—for
      instance I do not like Col. I being solicited to do this as he appears to have
      been—of course it is not his fault in the least degree—Certainly I have
      neither prompted nor authorized any thing of the kind—I welcome him &amp;
      applaud him—he is a noble &amp; frank man, and I am proud of his endorsement
      &amp; advocacy, &amp; think that speech at the Reisser dinner<sup><a href="#loc.07795_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> one of the chief <em>pinnacles</em> of my

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0839">4. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07837_n3">5. On  Bucke quoted from a letter from John
      H. Johnston: "This morning an hours talk with Ingersoll and I got his promise
      and authority to proceed and get up a lecture entertainment by him for Walt's
      benefit—in Phila I guess—Shall I put you on committee?" Almost
      invariably Johnston was the instigator of the remunerative benefits given for
      Walt Whitman in the last decade of his life.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07795_n2">6. Whitman's friends gave
      him a birthday supper on May 31 at Reisser's Restaurant in Philadelphia, at
      which Ingersoll gave a "grand speech, never to be forgotten by me" (<em>The Commonplace Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
      Brinton presided, and other speakers included Bucke and Silas Weir Mitchell. The
      Philadelphia <em>Inquirer</em> carried the story on the front page
      on the following day, and the account in the Camden <em>Post</em>
      on June 2 the poet reprinted in <em>Good-bye My Fancy</em>(<em>Prose Works, 1892</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall, 2 vols. [New York:
      New York University Press: 1963-1964], 686-687). On  Bucke asked Whitman whether Traubel was responsibe for the article
      in the <em>Post</em>. Later Traubel wrote "Walt Whitman's
      Birthday" for <em>Unity</em> (xxv [August 28, 1890], 215). On  Ingersoll wrote to Whitman: "I can hardly
      tell you what pleasure it gave me to meet you—to look into your eyes, to
      hear your voice, to grasp your hands and to thank you for the brave and splendid
      words you have uttered."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07837_n4">7. Bucke replied to this
      objection on : "I think you are right
      to stand aside (personally) from this I[ngersoll] demonstration but for my part
      (as a friend of the cause) I look upon it (and think you should) with great
      complacency. I think therefore that you are entirely wrong to be 'annoyed' at a
      demonstration in your favor even if it were entirely by
      freethinker[s]—they cannot alter you or your teaching and (on the
      contrary) you will undoubtedly, in the end, alter many of them and will have (in
      the end) in all probability your most extreme partisans &amp; lovers in this
      section of humanity."<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="n0285">9. Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908),
      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0299">10. Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a French-born
      landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman (1823–1890), Walt
      Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_96.html">Heyde, Charles Louis (1822–1892)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.07837_n6">11. According to Heyde's
      letter on , the two women had cleaned the
      house, bought various necessities, but had failed to leave "25 dollars for the
      taxes." Heyde complained again on September 8 that "no money was bestowed," and
      said that he was consulting real estate agents in Camden about buying a house
      there (no doubt a threat). On  and again
      on , after effusive praise, he reminded
      the poet of the $25 needed to pay taxes and interest.<a href="#r11">[back]
