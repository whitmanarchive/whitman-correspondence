   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07831_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      J W Wallace | Anderton near Chorley | Lancashire | England. It is postmarked:
      Camden, N.J. | Aug 30 | 8 PM | 90.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00869_n1">2. The poet had the special
      pocket-book edition printed in honor of his 70th birthday, May 31, 1889, through
      special arrangement with Frederick Oldach. See Whitman's  letter to Oldach.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07831_n2">3. Wallace sent 22 shillings
      for the book on August 18-19.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4102">4. John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_97.html">Johnston, Dr. John (d.1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07831_n3">5. Dr. John Johnston's most
      recent letter is dated , which didn't
      arrive in Camden until September 6. The only extant letter from Johnston
      antedating the letter of August 27 is the letter that Johnston and Wallace wrote
      together on May 5. This suggests that the letter Whitman is referring to has not
      survived.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.02440_n5">6. Gabriel Sarrazin's
      "Poètes modernes de l'Amérique—Walt Whitman" appeared in <em>La Nouvelle Revue</em> 52 (May 1888): 164–184. <em>The Universal Review</em> reprinted Sarrazin's essay in
      French. See <em>The Universal Review</em> 6 (1890):
      247–269.<a href="#r6">[back]
