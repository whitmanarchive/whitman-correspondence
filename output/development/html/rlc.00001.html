      <br></br>Washington, D. C. United States.
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">January 16, 1872.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear sir:<sup xmlns=""><a href="#rlc.00001_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Supposing that the books &amp; papers I sent you in response to your letter have safely
      arrived, I thought I would now write you a few lines. What I have to submit &amp; say,
      I will just say without ceremony—confident you will receive it in the same spirit
      in which it is written.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I sent you (by Mr. Clausen<sup><a href="#rlc.00001_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>) my poems "Leaves of Grass"—and little prose work "Democratic Vistas"—also a piece
      I recited at opening of an Exhibition of Industry in New York;<sup><a href="#rlc.00001_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> adding several criticisms, sketches, &amp;c. about the books &amp; about myself, written
      by different persons from different points of view. These will furnish you with sufficient
      material for your examination, digest, &amp;c.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The main object of my poetry is simply to present—sometimes by directions, but oftener
      by indirections—the Portraiture or model of a sound, large, complete, physiological,
      emotional, moral, intellectual &amp; spiritual <em>Man</em>, a good son, brother, husband, father, friend &amp; practical citizen—&amp; <em>Woman</em> also, a good wife, mother, practical citizen too—adjusted to the modern, to the New
      World, to Democracy, &amp; to science. My verse strains its every nerve to arouse, brace,
      dilate, excite to the love &amp; realization of health, friendship, perfection, freedom,
      amplitude. There are other objects, but these are the main ones.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The central purpose of "Democratic Vistas" is to project &amp; outline a fresh &amp; brawny
      race of original American Imaginative authors, with <em>moral purpose</em>, Hegelianism, underlying their works, poems—and with Science &amp; Democracy—also thoroughly
      <em>religious</em>—(not ecclesiastical or sectarian merely.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And now an item for your proposed review:</p>
   
   
   <p>When you are composing your review, I would like to have you bring in, in a proper
      place, the following mentioned facts<sup><a href="#rlc.00001_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—that neither my poetic "Leaves" or "Democratic Vistas" is cordially accepted in the
      United States—nor do the chief literary persons or organs of the country admit the
      poems as having any merit, or recognize the author as a poet at all—that he has once
      indeed been ignominiously ejected from a moderate government employment at Washington
      by special order of a Cabinet officer there, for the sole &amp; avowed reason that he
      was the writer of the book; that up to this time no American publisher will publish
      it (the author printing the various editions himself)<sup><a href="#rlc.00001_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—that many of the booksellers refuse to keep it for sale—that the swarms of versifiers
      and writers of book notices in America are quite generally banded against this new
      man (myself) and that his position, in his own country, both as to literary recognition
      &amp; worldly prosperity, has been, and remains to-day, under a heavy &amp; depressing cloud.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Of course you will at the same time hardly need to be told that I take all this very
      coolly—that my book is written in the sun &amp; with a gay heart—for these surely, fully
      belong to me. But I think a good foreign review of my works would be more complete
      by giving those facts—would be hardly complete without them—for they are <em>the substantial facts</em>, notwithstanding a few exceptions.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Meanwhile, abroad, my book &amp; myself have had a welcome quite dazzling. Tennyson writes
      me friendly letters, inviting me to become his guest.<sup><a href="#rlc.00001_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Freilegrath  translates &amp; commends my poems. Robert Buchanan,<sup><a href="#rlc.00001_n8" id="r7">7</a></sup> Swinburne, and all the great English &amp; Dublin colleges, affectionately receive me
      &amp; doughtily champion me. And while I, the author, am without any recompense at all
      in America, the English pirate-publisher, Hotten,<sup><a href="#rlc.00001_n9" id="r8">8</a></sup> derives a handsome annual income from a bad &amp; defective London reprint of my Poems.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish you to speak of the purpose of "Democratic Vistas." (It is at present in danger
      of falling still-born here.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I should be glad to hear more from you, your magazine—Denmark too. For all, accept
      my friendliest good wishes.
   </p>

   <p><em>Later</em>—Upon reading over my letter within, previous to mailing it, I had almost decided
      not to send it—as a part of it may be open to the imputation of a complaining spirit,
      &amp; querulousness—Yet as nothing can be further from my real state of mind, (which is
      <em>more</em> than satisfied, &amp; delightedly grateful for my literary fortunes &amp; reception by the
      world,) I will let it go.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="rlc.00001_n1">1. 
      Rudolf Schmidt, editor of <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em>,
      wrote to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871, "I intend to write an article
      about yourself and your writings in the above named periodical which is very
      much read in all the Scandinavian countries. …I therefore take the
      liberty to ask you, if you should not be willing to afford some new
      communications of yourself and your poetry to this purpose" (Library of
      Congress).<br><br>
      In this letter Whitman was furnishing information Schmidt sought for his
      article; see Whitman's  letter
      to Schmidt. This and Whitman's  letter to Edward Dowden contain almost identical statements
      of Whitman's conception of his works.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00001_n2">2. Carl F. Clausen, termed in
      Schmidt's letter "my old friend and countryman," corresponded with Schmidt after
      he left Denmark in 1860; see Carl Roos, "Walt Whitman's Letters to a Danish
      Friend," <em>Orbis Litterarum</em>, 7 (1949), 34–39. The
      city directory in 1870 listed him as a draughtsman and in 1872 as a patent
      agent. He died of consumption in the middle 1870s; see the Thomas Biggs Harned
      Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #108.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00001_n3">3. Whitman refers here to
      his poem, "After All, Not to Create Only." For first periodical printings of
      this poem, see the 7 September 1871 issues of the <em></em> and the <em></em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00001_n4">4. Once again Whitman
      restated what was by this time a somewhat shop-worn charge—a poet
      systematically persecuted by governmental authority and by American newspapers
      and journals. In his desire to appear in the role of a martyr, he consistently
      neglected mention of the coverage he received in the press. Even Horace Traubel,
      in 1889, dissented from Whitman's opinion; see <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.11.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> (1906–1996),
      4:61–62. In addition, sales were better than he admitted; Whitman wrote of
      strong sales in his  letter to
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00001_n5">5. Again Whitman omitted
      reference to the 1860 edition published by Thayer and Eldridge.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00001_n6">6. Tennyson made such an offer
      in his  letter to Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00001_n8">7. Robert Buchanan
      (1841–1901), English poet and critic, had lauded Whitman in the <em>Broadway Annual</em> in 1867, and in 1872 praised Whitman but
      attributed his poor reception in England to the sponsorship of William Michael
      Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne. See Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in England</em> (1934), 79–80, and Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> (1955), 445–446. Swinburne's
      recantation later in the year may be partly attributable to Buchanan's
      injudicious remarks.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00001_n9">8. 
      For Whitman's relationship with John Camden Hotten and the "bad &amp;
      defective" edition, see Whitman's  letter to Moncure D. Conway.<br><br>
      Mark Twain, incensed by the pirated edition of <em>The
         Innocents Abroad</em>, damned "John Camden Hottentot"; see Delancey
      Ferguson, <em>Mark Twain: Man and Legend</em> (1943),
      163.<a href="#r8">[back]
