   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00660_n1">1. This letter dates to March
      26–28, 1873. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman provided no date in her hand, and
      Edwin Haviland Miller dated the letter January 20, 1873 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:370). Miller's date is consistent with Louisa's and son
      Edward's residence in Camden, New Jersey, at the home of George Washington
      Whitman and wife Louisa Orr Haslam "Lou" Whitman, but Miller's date is
      incorrect. This letter dates to late March 1873, just after Lou returned from an
      extended trip to Philadelphia. For her daughter-in-law's impending departure,
      see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman. Two matters in this letter support a date of composition during the
      week of Lou's return. According to this letter, Louisa's daughter-in-law has
      been "gone since last saturday week." Also, Louisa had received a Tuesday letter
      from Walt. The date of her most recently received letter can be inferred by
      eliminating Walt's 
      letter, which ended a week-long hiatus in letters from him (see Louisa's  letter to Walt). The most reasonable
      surmise, then, is that this letter dates to late in the last full week of March
      and precedes Louisa's 
      letter to her son. The Tuesday letter from Walt (not extant) dates to March 23,
      1873. If Lou's mid-March trip to Philadelphia ended approximately March 25 and a
      letter from Walt was received on Tuesday (March 25), this letter dates to
      between March 26 and March 28, 1873.<a href="#r1">[back]

      1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant. Edwin Haviland Miller,
      who dated this letter January 20, 1873, dated no lost letter January 19, 1873

      University Press, 1961–77], 2:363; 2:370).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00615_n6">3. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r3">[back]

      Whitman's impending departure to Philadelphia, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
       letter to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">5. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00660_n7">6. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. He married Louisa Orr Haslam in
      spring 1871, and they moved to 722 Stevens Street in Camden, where he was
      employed inspecting pipe at foundry sites for Joseph Phineas Davis, Moses Lane,
      and on periodic contracts for the Brooklyn Water Works. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="loc.00660_n8">7. When Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman and son Edward began living with George Washington and Louisa Orr Haslam
      Whitman, Walt Whitman sent his mother $20 per month, $15 for Edward's board (see
      Walt's  and  letters to Louisa).<a href="#r7">[back]
