   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00632_n4">1. This letter dates to May 13
      or 14, 1873. On an accompanying slip of paper held in the Trent Collection (not
      reproduced here), Richard Maurice Bucke dated this letter only "near the end,"
      and Edwin Haviland Miller dated it May 12 (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      219, n. 80). Because Walt Whitman acknowledged a letter from his mother on May
      16, this letter dates to one or two days later than Miller's date. Walt
      acknowledged a Wednesday letter from his mother and a Thursday letter from
      Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman in his 
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. According to Walt, the "letter from Sister
      Lou written Thursday morning ... gives me great relief." In her May 15 letter
      (not extant) Louisa Orr had reported that "Sunday [May 11] was your worst day."
      If Walt received a letter written Thursday morning that described his mother's
      relief, it is unlikely that she had recovered enough from the Sunday (May 11)
      episode, presumably a stroke, to write on Monday. Walt most likely referred to
      this letter when he wrote "got your letter (Thursday)." Therefore, as Walt
      probably received this letter on Thursday, May 15, it dates to May 13 or May 14,
      1873.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00597_n3">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward moved from Brooklyn to
      reside with them in Camden in August 1872. For more information on George, see
