      <br></br><br></br>My Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Welcome was your postcard announcing recovered health<sup><a href="#loc.04213_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; return to Camden! May this find you safe there, well &amp; hearty, able to go freely
      to &amp; fro on the ferries &amp; streets. I wish one of those old red Market Ferry cars were
      going to land you at our door once more! What you would have to tell us of western
      scenes &amp; life! What teas &amp; what evenings we would have—you would certainly have to
      say "there is a point beyond which"—&amp; would have pretty late trips back of moonlight.
      Strange episode in my life! so unlike what went before &amp; what comes after—those evenings
      in Philadelphia—yet so natural, familiar, dear! If I were American-born, I certainly
      should not want to change it for any country in the world, and if as you have dreamed—as
      I too have dreamed—it is given us hereafter to have another spell of life on this
      old earth, may my lot be cast there when the great time dimly preparing is actually
      come. But meanwhile, dear Friend, my work lies here: innumerable are the ties that
      bind us. And I can only hope &amp; dream that you will come &amp; stay with us awhile when
      we have a home of our own. That dear little grandson<sup><a href="#upa.00189_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup> stayed with me two months till I really didn't know how to part with him, &amp; grew
      more &amp; more engaging &amp; pretty in his ways every day—rapid indeed is the opening of
      the little bud at that age—between 1 &amp; 3—&amp; the way he had of looking up &amp; giving you
      little kisses of his own accord would win anybody's heart. Bee's<sup><a href="#n0260" id="r4">4</a></sup> letters continue as cheery as ever—she is heartily enjoying work &amp; life, and accomplishing
      the purpose she has set her heart upon, &amp; the people she is with are so good and kindly,
      it is quite a home. She is working a good deal with the microscope. Her outdoor recreation
      is skating. Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r5">5</a></sup> is getting on very nicely. He has had a commission to make some designs for a new
      kind of painted tapestry—and his figures "Audrey &amp; Touchstone" are very much admired
      &amp; have been bought by a rich American, &amp; he has a commission for more. But the summer
      work he has set his heart upon is a portrait of you from all the material he brought
      with him—the many attempts he made there—handled with his present improved skill with
      the brush. I hope you will be able by &amp; bye to send him the photograph he asked for—but
      no hurry. Edward Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r6">6</a></sup> came up from Sheffield and spent an evening with us—which we all heartily enjoyed—he
      is a dear fellow. We talked much of you. He has been giving lectures this winter on
      the Lives of the Great Discoverers in Science. Carpenter knows intimately, goes freely
      among, a greater range &amp; variety of men than any Englishman I know—he has a way of
      making himself thoroughly welcome by the firesides of mechanics &amp; factory workers—his
      own kith &amp; kin are aristocratic.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Giddy<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r7">7</a></sup> is taking singing lessons again, &amp; hoping by the time you next see her to be able
      to contribute her share of the evening's pleasure. Percy<sup><a href="#n2000" id="r8">8</a></sup> is still working away indomitably at the "process," which is gaining ground rapidly
      on the continent, &amp; I hope I may say slowly &amp; surely in England. I see the Gilders
      now &amp; then—indeed they are coming up to lunch with us to-morrow—Mr. Gilder<sup><a href="#n0871" id="r9">9</a></sup> is the better for rest—&amp; they seem to enjoy England; but England has done her very
      worst in the way of climate ever since they have been here. O I do long for a little
      American sunshine. We met Henry James at the Conways last Sunday &amp; found him one of
      the pleasantest of talkers. Rossetti<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r10">10</a></sup> &amp; all your friends are well. Please give my love to your brothers &amp; sister. Were
      Jessie<sup><a href="#duk.00343_n2" id="r11">11</a></sup> &amp; Hattie<sup><a href="#n0911" id="r12">12</a></sup> at home in St. Louis, I wonder, when you were there? Love from us all.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Good-bye, Dearest Friend.
      <br></br>A. Gilchrist.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Please give my love to John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r13">13</a></sup> when you write or see him.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0259">1. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

      grandson and the Durham Cathedral (<em>The Letters of Anne
         Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Thomas B. Harned [New York: Doubleday,
      Page &amp; Company, 1918], 183).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0260">4. Beatrice Carwardine Gilchrist (1854–1881) was
      the second child (and first daughter) of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist. An
      aspiring physician, Beatrice took the needed preparatory classes but was barred
      (as were all women) from becoming a medical student in England. As a result, she
      attended the Women's Medical College in Philadelphia. She held positions as a
      physician in Berne, Switzerland, and later Edinburgh before committing suicide
      by fatally ingesting hydrocyanic acid in 1881.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n0262">5. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0141b">6. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0890">7. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2000">8. Percy Carlyle Gilchrist
      (1851–1935) was a British chemist and metallurgist, and the son of
      Alexander and Anne Gilchrist. Along with his cousin, Sidney Gilchrist Thomas, he
      developed the Thomas-Gilchrist process of producing steel from phosphoric pig
      iron during the late 1870s. See Marion Walker Alcaro, <em>Walt
         Whitman's Mrs. G: A Biography of Anne Gilchrist</em> (Cranbury, N.J.:
      Associated University Presses, 1991), 252 n28.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0871">9. Richard Watson Gilder
      (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <em>The Century</em>, from 1881 until his death. Whitman had met
      Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1955], 482). Whitman attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
      Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the <em>New York Tribune</em>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder
      one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
      delirium" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">Sunday, August 5, 1888</a>). For more about Gilder, see Susan L.
      Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_95.html">Gilder, Richard Watson (1844–1909)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">10. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r10">[back]

   <p id="duk.00343_n2">11. Jessie Louisa Whitman,
      the second daughter of Jeff and Martha Whitman, was born June 17, 1863.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0911">12. Mannahatta Whitman was the first
      daughter of Walt Whitman's brother, Jeff Whitman, and his wife Martha Mitchell
      Whitman.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">13. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r13">[back]
