      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>It is so many years since I saw you—you will not remember the child-friend and
      disciple of yours, I am afraid. She is no longer a child—the more's the
      pity!—but she claims the title of disciple and in that name asks a
      favor.— 
   </p> 
   
   <p>It has seemed to us that it would be a good thing to bring out a "Walt Whitman
      Calendar"<sup><a href="#loc.01202_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—of extracts from your Leaves of Grass—after the model
      (improved) of the Emerson<sup><a href="#n0218" id="r3">3</a></sup> and Shaksperean Calendars. They have a large sale
      among people who perhaps 
      
      never own a copy of the poems. It is a means of disseminating and popularizing where
      we cannot always
      reach in other ways.
   </p>
   
   <p>Will you give consent to the Calendar? Will you let me do it as my Christmas
      contribution to your comfort. I want to share with your other friends the honor of
      aiding and have nothing else to give. This I do believe I can do both speedily and
      well and your friends think it will sell widely. 
   </p>
   
   <p>A great deal of reading is already done towards it. I await only your card—a
      bare "yes" and all the rest is done. Time is so brief before the mark must be
      completed,— can you send me that word <u>at</u> 
      
      <u>once?</u> A postal card will suffice. I shall count the days
      for it eagerly and anxiously. 
   </p>
   
   <p>My Uncle (W. D O'Connor)<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r4">4</a></sup> left us
      yesterday with my father,<sup><a href="#n0148" id="r5">5</a></sup> for Washington— very lame and feeble. Mr. Eldridge<sup><a href="#loc.00943_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      remains. 
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With great affection and esteem,
      <br></br>Grace E. Channing. 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>P.S. [
      <span class="unclear">Mama?</span>]
      <sup><a href="#loc.01202_n2" id="r7">7</a></sup>

      would save a week of most precious time!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Grace Ellery Channing
      (1862–1937) was the daughter of William F. Channing and the niece of
      William D. O'Connor. After her initial refusal to ever read Whitman's work,
      Channing became enthralled by the poet's words and even published her own volume
      of Whitman-inspired poetry titled <em>Sea-Drift</em> in
      1899.

   <p id="loc.01202_n1">2. Whitman apparently first
      agreed to the idea but later claimed he never liked it and argued that his
      poetry does not lend itself to "piecemeal quotation" (<em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.27.html">Friday, August 10, 1888</a>). Work nevertheless went forward but it
      appears that the project never saw the light of day after several publishers had
      declined it. For more on the project, see Joann Krieg, "Grace Ellery Channing
      and the Whitman Calendar," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em>

   <p id="n0218">3. Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) was an
      American poet and essayist who began the Transcendentalist movement with his
      1836 essay <em>Nature</em>. On , Whitman informed Ralph Waldo Emerson that "" was "put in type for my own convenience,
      and to ensure greater correctness." He asked Emerson to take the poem to James
      T. Fields, editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, who promptly
      accepted it and published it in February 1869. For more on Emerson, see Jerome
      Loving, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_1.html">Emerson, Ralph Waldo [1809–1882]</a>," <em>Walt

      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet

      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

      O'Connor's brother-in-law and the son of William Ellery Channing, was by
      training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to scientific experiments. With
      Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm system. He was the author of
      <em>Notes on the Medical Application of Electricity</em>
      (1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, R. I., and Whitman

      one half of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge,
      who put out the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In
      December 1862, on his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg,
      Virginia, Walt Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had
      become a clerk in the office of the army paymaster and eventually obtained a
      desk for Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster. For
