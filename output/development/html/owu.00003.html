      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your letter and was right glad to get it<sup><a href="#owu.00003_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I am in rather a writing mood
      today and have written a long letter to Han<sup><a href="#owu.00003_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I also enclosed one from Jeff it was a
      very long and lively one and I thought it would please her. I am having very
      pleasant times here, sometimes, it is very gay, it it the style here when any one
      has company every one calls on them. tomorrow I have to return quite a number it is
      quite a bore to me to make fashionable calls but of course I must submit to it. but
      what I enjoy most of any thing else is sitting in my window looking down the 
      Susquanhanna
      
       for miles and on the opposite side long ranges of the 
      Alleganny
      
       Mountains they are mostly cultivated and their is something delightful
      about the scenery I would never tire looking at it we have not had what I call a
      real hot day  this
      summer the children are very happy and contented seldom talk about home they are
      very fat and burnt Hattie talks a good deal about seeing you, and says she is going
      out with Uncle Walt. I write to Mother quite often it seems to cheer her up to get
      letters, I tell her every little particular I have been to a number of picnics they
      are very pleasant. this week we expect to go to the
      Barclay coal mines<sup><a href="#owu.00003_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> every one around here seems related some way to Mr or Mrs Mason
      we also go riding a good deal the time passes quickly and I am much pleased that I
      decided to come here I expect to leave for Washington with Mary &amp; Jule the 29th
      ins't Wont you come and
       me Walt
      before you leave for Brooklyn<sup><a href="#owu.00003_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I want to see you very much about those "Notes"<sup><a href="#owu.00003_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> I would
      like much to have a copy but think it hardly worth while to send them here but you
      will save me a copy when I come to Washington I dont think of any more to write at
      present and it is getting late and I want yet to write one to Mother bidding you
      good night I remain your Affectionate sister

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Martha Mitchell Whitman (d. 1873) known as "Mattie,"
      was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and
      Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
      the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat
      ailment that would lead to her death in 1873.
