      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I wrote to your
      Quaker friends thanking
      them for the invitation
      for the 22d. I could not
      have gone in any case,
      my wife was ill in bed
      &amp; I had to go to Delaware
      Co to examine a bank,
      
      Ursula was ill in N.Y.
      She had a relapse after
      returning home, &amp; has had
      a hard time,—ague, bronchitis, &amp; a gathering in her
      ear. She is better now &amp; is
      down stairs to-day for the
      first in nearly two weeks. My own
      health is nothing to brag of,
      I thought the trouble was
      with my nervous system,
      but the doctor finds it
      in my arterial; arteries
      hard &amp; brittle, danger
      from apoplexy &amp;c. Not
      a very cheering diagnosis
      tho', I may live to be
      hanged yet. I have
      given up eating meat
      &amp; have otherwise changed
      my habits—shall probably
      
      go out home in the spring
      &amp; spend the season on the
      old home farm. I seem
      to have felt a shadow creeping
      over me for some years,
      &amp; this is what it means.
      But I shall not lose heart:
      I shall try to gain some of your
      own cheerfulness &amp; serenity.
      I wish much I could see
      you. If you had only sent
      me word that day, I was
      on the point of coming over,
      but felt sure I should
      miss you if I did.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I received your check for
      $100 all right. I have a
      little [
      <span class="unclear">glimpse?</span>]
       of Carlyle &amp;
      
      his country in the March
      <u>Atlantic.</u>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I hope you keep well. Is
      there any news from Boston
      about the effort to stop the
      sale of your poems?
