      <br></br><br></br>Honoured &amp; dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now that "enthusiastic cherishing from the few, gradually growing less few"<sup><a href="#loc.02250_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> has come to mean cherishing thousands growing to tens of
      thousands, most likely, your correspondents are overwhelmingly numerous.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This sense forbids my taking up the pen carelessly to intrude upon your
      attention.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I. Mr. H.H. Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r4">4</a></sup> has kindly given me particulars enabling
      me to apply to you, a great privilege, for some of your works—indeed I would
      like to possess most of them &amp; these in their sacred unmutilated
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>entirety. 'Leaves of Grass,' Authors' Edition (1876)—'Two Rivulets' (1876),
      'Specimen Days &amp; Collect,' are those mentioned to me by Mr. Gilchrist. Will you
      have the kindness to send me these works, informing me at the same time of their
      cost, the amount of which I will not delay in sending.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>II. A request in another direction: I must begin by a détour. All men &amp;
      women of generous soul who read you in your writings feel a brother's, the Poet's
      hand extended to them.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I came to grasp it; my humility to God, my esteem to you.</p>
   
   
   <p>Tho' unknown to you I shall make no attempt to establish my fitness to ask your aid
      in
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>a matter belonging to my work as a composer. Intention must befriend me or my chance
      must fall.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have already treated in choral &amp; orchestral setting three great heads of human
      absorption—the theological, the humanitarian &amp; the erotic—the first,
      upon Keble's<sup><a href="#loc.02250_n8" id="r5">5</a></sup> "Christmas Day" (Christian Year)—the second,
      upon George Eliot's<sup><a href="#n3044" id="r6">6</a></sup> "O May I Join the Choir Invisible"; the
      third, upon W. Morris'<sup><a href="#loc.02250_n9" id="r7">7</a></sup> lyrical piece in "The Hill of Venus". In
      the first,—I send you a copy of this work<sup><a href="#loc.02250_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup>—I
      have perforce of my religious perception, vested the subject, 'The Nativity' with
      human belongings, human throbs in the Christ as founder, as a man, is solemn
      fact—the super natural story of him, to me, is but a grand Myth, the grandest
      perhaps of all time.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Of my "Song of Humanity" I endeavour to convey the spirituality in these
      words—
   </p>
   
   
   "A celebration of man's high destiny—
   <br>truth above the Faiths, the Religion of moral goodness,
   <br>Fraternal sonship, responsive and responsible—Hope illimitable, beautiful,
   strong, unvanquishable
   <br><br>
   
   "Through sorrow &amp; the inscrutable—the experience of Omnipotent order
   &amp; love".
   <br><br>
   
   
   <p>To the third production—"Hymn to Venus"<sup><a href="#loc.02250_n4" id="r9">9</a></sup>—to
      which I allude I have written as 'Argument'—"That which annihilates man's
      capacity as a moral being, is the presumption of his <u>need</u>
      of a regeneration that
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>he may be acceptable to man or God.</p>
   
   
   <p>Were he, at his coming, hailed as a creative 'form, virtuous but capable of sin'<sup><a href="#loc.02250_n5" id="r10">10</a></sup>—had he the <u>responsibility</u>, placed upon him of an <u>innate</u>
      pure &amp; noble moral nature, the relations of man to man would be radically, &amp;
      absolutely altered.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Between woman &amp; man there would be gentle ministering to holy yearnings where now
      is sullen unrest, physical &amp; mental misery; and worse
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>corruption the direst man can suffer—his fallen sister'.</p>
   
   
   <p>Man would find edification in what now is his shame—the human God—imaged
      form, which lasts not beyond this fair earth.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The sculptor's highest inspiration could be no man's <u>lust</u>:
      alas! the word ever conveyed a meaning.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In this lyric the poet sings of life as it <u>was without</u>
      Venus, &amp; without the bond of fraternity. Indeed, he tells of life as it <u>is</u> with us today "'mid weary thoughts of man &amp;
      God"<sup><a href="#loc.02250_n6" id="r11">11</a></sup> go we our daily round;
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>with <u>faiths</u> for our salvation which have their base &amp;
      rising of other elements than those of the eternal laws of human love (which is the
      divine), &amp; that Christly religion, <u>moral goodness</u>,
      which alone gives proof to <u>see</u>
      <u>feel</u> &amp; <u>know</u> an Almighty
      God—a Father of all benevolence, tho' peace &amp; joy, throes &amp; heaviness
      hold the present of the [
      <span class="unclear">single?</span>]
       heart.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Such, be it affirmed, was the composers' conception of the lot of man while
      contemplating the subject before him".
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I would next treat as a subject some</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>view of life &amp; incident of America's heroic Democracy—the 4 years war, or
      the war of Independence.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And now I return to my request—merely, that you may indicate to me where &amp;
      how I might find a text for such a work as I have in mind—an Opera or a
      Dramatic Oratorio. For both purposes alike the literary expression should pass
      briefly on in lucid meaning, never involved.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The verse interwoven in blank &amp; lyric structure.</p>
   
   
   <p>I should more than value your 
      meagrest
      
       suggestion &amp; indeed, would not willingly put you to the trouble of
      more than this.

      <em>Daniel Deronda</em> (1876). Whitman was especially
