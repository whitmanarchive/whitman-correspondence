   <p>An incipient "cold in the head" (from an open sash behind me two hours yesterday
      toward evn'g forgotten)—may pass over lightly—may grow
      worse—(generally of late seems to settle on, merge in bladder
      trouble)—Otherwise matters much the same—partial bowel action (thankful
      for that)—half sunny weather this forenoon, rather cold—The "Magazine of
      Poetry" from you came—all looks better than I w'd have
      anticipated—pictures, print, paper very fair—I see I appear quite
      largely—good biographic sketch f'm y'r pen I accept &amp; like well<sup><a href="#loc.07576_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—quite many names I had not heard
      before—rather an apotheosis of good mediocrity isn't it? &amp; why not?

   <p>Feb: 5 noon</p>
   
   <p>Nothing special—I am sitting by the stove alone—partial bowel dejection
      an hour ago—no letters rec'd this morn'g—sell two copies <em>Nov: B</em><sup><a href="#n6180" id="r3">3</a></sup> to-day—I send papers &amp; p[ost] cards to
      O'C[onnor]<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r4">4</a></sup> every other day—nothing very late from

      keep it open)—I sell the C W to McK h'f calf bound for $4—so you see I
      don't indeed make much—will soon send you a printed slip of the Sarrazin<sup><a href="#n3115" id="r7">7</a></sup> fragment as the proof from K[ennedy]<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r8">8</a></sup> has

      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      <em>November Boughs</em>, which was published in October 1888.

   <p id="n2002">4. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="nyp.00580_n3">5. David McKay
      (1860–1918) was a Philadelphia-based publisher, whose company, founded in
      1882, printed a number of books by and about Walt Whitman in the 1880s and
      1890s, such as the 1891/1892 editon of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>,
      Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em>, and Richard Maurice Bucke's
      1883 biography of the poet.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4188">6. Whitman often referred to <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888) as his "big book." With
      the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made the presswork and binding decisions,
      and Frederick Oldach bound the volume, which included a profile photo of the
      poet on the title page. Philadelphia publisher David McKay published the book in
      December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n3115">7. Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935)
      was a translator and poet from France, who commented positively not only on
      Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and
      apparently liked the critic's work on <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>—Whitman even had Sarrazin's chapter on his book translated
      twice. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="n3039">8. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07577_n3">9. Whitman is referring to
      Gabriel Sarrazin's "Poetes modernes de l'Amerique, Walt Whitman," which appeared
      in <em>La Nouvelle Revue</em>, 52 (May 1, 1888), 164–184.
      Whitman had asked both William Sloane Kennedy and Richard Maurice Bucke to make
      an abstract in English of it (see Whitman's letter to Kennedy of , and to Bucke of ). Sarrazin's piece is reprinted in
      an English translation by Harrison S. Morris in <em>In Re</em>
      (1893, pp. 159–194).<a href="#r9">[back]
