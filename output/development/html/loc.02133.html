      (1860–1940) was an American novelist and autobiographer, known especially
      for his works about the hardships of farm life in the American Midwest. For his
      relationship to Whitman, see Thomas K. Dean, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_190.html">Garland, Hamlin</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4317">1. William Dean Howells
      (1837–1920) was an American realist novelist and literary critic, serving
      the staff of the <em>New York Nation</em> and <em>Harper's Magazine</em> during the mid 1860s. During his tenure as
      editor-in-chief of <em> The Atlantic Monthly</em> from 1871 to
      1880, he was one of the foremost critics in New York, and used his influence to
      support American authors like Hamlin Garland, Stephen Crane, and Emily
      Dickinson. He also brought attention to European authors like Henrik Ibsen,
      Giovanni Verga, and Leo Tolstoy in particular. Howells was highly skeptical of
      Whitman's poetry, however, and frequently questioned his literary merit. In an
      Ashtabula <em> Sentinel </em>review of the 1860 edition <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, Howells wrote, "If he is indeed 'the
      distinctive poet of America,' then the office of poet is one which must be left
      hereafter to the shameless and the friendless. for WALT WHITMAN is not a man
      whom you would like to know." In 1865, Howells would write the first important
      review of <em> Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Round
         Table</em>, demonstrating early signs of his conflicted opinion about
      Whitman. For more information on Howells, see Goodman, Susan &amp; Dawson, Carl,
      <em>William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life</em> (Berkeley:
      University of California Press, 2005).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0129">2. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n3145">3. Mellen Chamberlain
      (1821–1900) was the librarian of the Boston Public Library as well as a
      lawyer and historian.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4973">4. John Boyle O'Reilly
      (1844–1890) was a fervent Irish patriot who joined the British Army in
      order to sabotage it. He was arrested and sentenced to be hanged in 1866. Later
      the decree was altered, and O'Reilly was sent to Australia, where he escaped on
      an American whaler in 1869. In 1876 he became the coeditor of the Boston <em>Pilot</em>, a position which he held until his death in 1890.
      See William G. Schofield, <em>Seek for a Hero: The Story of John
         Boyle O'Reilly</em> (New York: Kennedy, 1956). For more on O'Reilly, see
      also the letter from Whitman to James R. Osgood of .<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n6000">5. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
