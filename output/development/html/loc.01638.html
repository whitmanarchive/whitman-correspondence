      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete, 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am having another of my bad spells to-day—but it will pass over—I have had a pretty
      good 
      time most of the week till last night—thought I was getting decidedly better—(&amp; guess
      I am yet, &amp; that this will pass over.)
   </p>
   
   <p>Every thing goes on the same with me here. As I write this, I am sitting here alone
      as usual 
      in the parlor by the heater—I have just been out, but it was so chilly &amp; raw, I didn't
      
      venture off the block, but came back in 5 or 6 minutes—the air feels like snow.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>The trains of the Camden &amp; Amboy are going by on the track about 50 or 60 rods from
      here, 
      puffing &amp; blowing—often train after train, following each other—&amp; locomotives singly,
      
      whisking &amp; squealing, up the track &amp; then down again—I often sit here 
      &amp; watch them long—&amp; think of you.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think I shall try again to get out, evening—sometimes it makes me feel better, 
      after I get out in the open air, &amp; move around a little
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>7:15 evening—Friday—</p>
   
   
   <p>—I am writing this over in the Mercantile Library, 10th st. Phila.—I have felt better 
      since 4 o'clock &amp; have come out &amp; crossed the river, &amp; taken quite a ride up Market
      st. 
      2 miles in the Market st. cars. The cars are very nice, old style, cushioned, fare
      7 cents—if you get a transfer you have to pay extra—the working hours are from 16½
      to 18—they have the new alarm punch,—every fare or ticket,—rings a little bell every
      time you punch—I suppose you have seen it—they say it is quite a success, &amp; they are
      introducing them 
      in other cities—but it will get played out—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Pete write how you are getting along—&amp; all about the folks, every one I know—I am
      feeling as well as usual, as I finish this letter—Good bye for this time my loving
      son—
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Dont you get discouraged at work—or on the road—I feel that we shall yet 
      be together, &amp; have good times just being with each other, no matter how poor
      
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
