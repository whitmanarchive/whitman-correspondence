   <p>Your good, long, varied and loving letter came yesterday and has been welcome and
      nourishing me. Sure I read about that Australian "interior" bit, and "shearing," and
      about the experience and death of Gordon, the poet<sup><a href="#med.00897_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—and the whole letter, with much I will not particularize—with deepest interest, and
      thank you for sending it to me and hope for more; and can almost see you all there,
      and would wish to specifically send remembrance and love to you, Fred Woods, Jim Hartigan,
      Ada, Eve, Mr and Mrs Fryer, Ted, Louie, "Tom Touchstone" (when there)<sup><a href="#med.00897_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> and any other friends not named. The cute and loving appreciation of my book and
      me by them in Australia has gone right to my heart—is far more than literary or technical
      fame.

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br> O'Dowd (1866-1953), a self-styled "poor
      clerk in an obscure library" in Melbourne, Australia, wrote for the first time
      to Walt Whitman on March 12, although there is extant an unsent draft letter
      written on August 6, 1889. From his confessions in various letters it is clear
      that O'Dowd, the son of an Irish policeman, had a lonely and loveless childhood,
      that he was reared a Roman Catholic only to become a freethinker, that he became
      a teacher at an early age but then drifted (not unlike Walt Whitman) from job to
      job, and that despite his marriage the year before in his own eyes he was "a
      failure" and "an enigma to myself." He saw Walt Whitman as an heroic father
      figure: "Had Carlyle added another chapter to his 'Hero Worship' the 'Hero as
      Nurse' with Walt Whitman as subject would have worthily capped his dome"
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; A. L. McLeod, ed., Walt Whitman in Australia
      and New Zealand (1964), 23). For discussions of O'Dowd, see A. L. McLeod's
      article in Walt Whitman Review, VII (1961), 23-35, and in Walt Whitman in
      Australia and New Zealand (1964).

      Whitman wrote to O'Dowd on July 12 after receiving a letter on the preceding

      (1954), Victor Kennedy and Nettie Palmer, claim to have seen a copy; see Walt
      Whitman Review, VII (1961), 28n.<a href="#r1">[back]

      O'Dowd had recently visited according to his letter on June 9 (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection; A. L. McLeod, ed., Walt Whitman in Australia and New
      Zealand (1964), 21).<a href="#r2">[back]
