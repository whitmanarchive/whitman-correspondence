      <br></br><br></br>Dear Hank—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I feel to write you a card, but I guess it will be a dry one, for I have nothing to
      write about, &amp; I 
      havn't
      
       got very smart yet—I go out though—(Seems to
      me if I couldn't go out in the sun &amp; open air I should give up
      entirely)—How did you make out with the piece for the Lyceum? I suppose you
      
      rec'd
      
       what I sent you—the extracts on poetry—did you make a piece <em>and
         read it</em> as I told you?<sup><a href="#nyp.00429_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> (I'll bet five dollars you didn't
      do any thing of the kind)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I 
      rec'd
      
       a pamphlet from Edward Carpenter to-day—his forthcoming lectures for
      1881—perhaps he sent you one—I have been in all day, occupying myself
      reading &amp; writing a little—Shall go out now for a couple of
      hours—There I told you this would be a dry letter—
   </p>
