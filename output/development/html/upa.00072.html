      address: Herbert Gilchrist | 5 Mount Vernon | Hampstead | London England. It is
      postmarked: Haddonfield | Apr | 29 | N.J.; Philad'a Pa. | Apr | 25(?) | Paid

   <p id="upa.00072_n2">2. Whitman was at Glendale
      from April 23 to May 4 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]

      Montgomery (1862–1926?), Van Doran (1864–1914), and George
      (1869–1924). For Ruth, see the letter from Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist of

   <p id="upa.00072_n4">4. Whitman sent to Mrs.
      Gilchrist the account in the Camden <em>Daily Post</em> on April
      16, 1880 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). On 
      Mrs. Gilchrist wrote at length about Beatrice's decision to give up her medical
      studies. Evidently during her stay in Switzerland Beatrice had decided that
      because she was intellectually incapable of becoming an ideal physician, she
      preferred to abandon the profession. Her sympathetic (but possessive) mother
      observed that "the profession was like a great man that swallowed her up from
      me." A year later Beatrice committed suicide (see the letter from Whitman to
      Harry Stafford of ).<a href="#r4">[back]
