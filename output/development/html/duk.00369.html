      <br></br><br></br>Dear Uncle
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have nothing of much consequence to write you this morning. A fine day this is likely
      to be although I am on guard. Yesterday I was over to the City &amp; saw the Boys in Ward.
      A. . I also went to your residence but found you absent  I enquired where you had
      gone &amp; when you would be at home  I could get no information on that subject, therefore I returned
      to the Hospital then to this Camp.
   </p>
   
   <p>I was disappointed in not seeing you  I came over on that Errand. But alas I came
      back without seeing you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Perhaps I will see you before I am sent a way to the front if possible</p>
   
   <p>Orders are very strict in this camp also through out the defences of Washington that
      is one reason why I had rather be sent to the Regiment I would not stay around this City the rest of my time in service
      for a considerable a mount of Pork &amp; Soft Bread
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt yours I received after I returned from the City to the Camp. It came all right
      side up
   </p>
   
   <p>I was very glad to have you write &amp; I will scribble this as an answer at your request
      that you may know I received your kind &amp; welcome letter. My best wishes are with you
      for indeed I have found a Friend at last to the poor Soldier
   </p>
   
   <p>I will close this by hopeing to hear from you again</p>

      Ever Your Friend

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>"Little Mitch," or Reuben
      Farwell, served with the Michigan Cavalry during the War and met Walt Whitman in
      Armory Square Hospital early in 1864, and upon his release from the hospital he
      corresponded with Whitman. After Farwell received his discharge on August 24,
      1864, he returned to his home in Plymouth, Michigan. Evidently the
      correspondence was renewed when Whitman sent a post card on February 5, 1875. On
      March 5, 1875, Farwell, who owned a farm in Michigan, wrote: "Walt my dear old
      Friend how I would like to grasp your hand and give you a kiss as I did in the
      days of yore. what a satisfaction it would be to me." In Farwell's last letter,
      on August 16, 1875, he said that he was planning to leave shortly for
      California. Eleven letters from Farwell are in the Trent Collection. He is
      mentioned in <em>Memoranda During the War</em> (see <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>, 10 vols. [New
      York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 4:134). When Bucke wrote to Farwell after Walt
      Whitman's death, apparently only this one note, written "on the back of a
      circular," was extant (Miller). For Farwell's other correspondence with Whitman
      see , , , , , .
