   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00509_n17">1. This letter dates to
      December 15, 1867. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "December the 15,"
      and the letter begins, "if it wasent sunday." The most probable reading is that
      she wrote her letter on Sunday, and December 15, 1867 fell on Sunday. Richard
      Maurice Bucke dated the letter to 1867, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with
      Bucke's year (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> (New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77), 1:356, n. 54; 1:379). The year is
      consistent with the presence of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and his family
      in Brooklyn and with efforts to remove James "Jimmy" Whitman, son of Walt's
      deceased brother Andrew Jackson Whitman, from the care of his mother Nancy
      McClure Whitman, an effort that would intensify in spring 1868. Other factors
      consistent with the year 1867 are the status of George Washington Whitman's
      business of building houses on speculation and the casual reference to daughter
      Hannah (Whitman) Heyde. The latter reference rules out the following year
      because in late 1868 Hannah had a serious infection required amputation of her
      thumb in December.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00502_n3">3. The nickname "Sis" refers to
      Jessie Louisa Whitman (1863–1957), the daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Jessie and her sister Manahatta "Hattie" were both favorites of
      their uncle Walt. The nickname "Sis" was given first to Manahatta but was passed
      to her younger sister Jessie Louisa when Manahatta became "Hattie."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00440_n3">4. Manahatta Whitman
      (1860–1886), known as "Hattie," was the daughter of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven years of her life in
      the same home with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was especially close to her
      grandmother. Hattie and her younger sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957) were
      both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00471_n5">6. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Walter Whitman, Sr., and
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. She resided in Burlington, Vermont, with her husband
      Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. The relationship
      between Hannah and Charles was difficult and marred with quarrels and disease.
      Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor
      treatment of Hannah. Louisa wrote, "if heyde was kind to her she would get well"
      (see her  letter to
      Walt).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00509_n9">7. In Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's request to Walt Whitman that he "write to that man about young jim,"
      the phrase "that man" most likely refers to Edward McClure, the brother of Nancy
      McClure, who was the spouse of Louisa's deceased son Andrew Jackson Whitman.
      James "Jimmy" was Louisa's grandson, the child of Andrew and Nancy. The effort
      to remove Nancy's children resumed with greater intensity the following year.
      After a May 1868 visit that from Jane McClure (Edward McClure's wife), Louisa
      wrote to Walt that the McClures sought to have Jim placed into a public orphan
      asylum (see her  letter to Walt). In May
      1868, Louisa asked Walt to write to James Cornwell, a friend of Andrew who
      served as a judge in the Brooklyn City Hall.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00432_n21">8. Nancy McClure Whitman was
      the widowed wife of Andrew Jackson Whitman. For the identification of McClure as
      Nancy's maiden name and information on Andrew's wife and children, see Jerome M.
      Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
