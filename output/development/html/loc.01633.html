   <p>Well Pete, my dear loving boy, I have just come in from a 15 minutes walk outside,
      
      with my little dog—it is now ½ past 1 Friday afternoon—the bright sun shining, 
      &amp; the air &amp; every thing as pleasant as one could wish—(after most a week of rainy,
      
      dark &amp; disagreeable but warmish weather)—I have the same old story to tell,—&amp; thankful
      enough to have nothing worse to communicate—it is probable I am 
      really slowly gaining—though I have occasional bad spells yet.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter was received—I was thinking whether something could not be done 
      about getting the position of through baggage master—&amp; feel inclined to try for you—(You
      know there is nothing of that sort done without trying)—Did you get the story 
      "Rolling Stone,"<sup><a href="#loc.01633_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I sent by P.O.?—I have had a visitor from New York this forenoon—an old acquaintance, a printer
      &amp; foreman, I knew 20 years ago, very sickly &amp; expecting to die, 
      at that time—<u>now</u> quite lively &amp; well, really jolly &amp; magnetic, &amp; good company &amp; a good fellow, 
      (like Parker Milburn)—I have an occasional visitor, but not many—Pete if you see any
      body 
      coming to Phil. you think I would like to see, give 'em my address—I am glad to see most any one
      for a change—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
