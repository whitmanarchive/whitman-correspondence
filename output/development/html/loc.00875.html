      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have not seen your friend Babbitt since he left the Mason Hospital (about the time
      I wrote you before); but I have been there to inquire about him<sup><a href="#loc.00875_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>.  Three days ago I called, and a soldier who had recently seen him reported him as gradually regaining his strength, though not his voice.  He is able to go out a
      little.  He is with, or near, some good friends of his, who are no doubt a comfort
      to him.
   </p>
   
   <p>What you write me of yourself and of your experiences, interests me and makes me almost
      envy you the privilege of being with our noble unfortunate soldiers.  You ought to write the epic of this
      war.  By the way, has anything been done with Drum Taps?  O'Connor<sup><a href="#loc.00875_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> said he would communicate with Carleton<sup><a href="#loc.00875_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> on the subject.  I have spoken with one publisher here about them; but he did not
      bite.
   </p>
   
   <p>An item of great domestic importance to us will perhaps interest you.  A boy was born to me yesterday—a
      lusty little chap, fat, well-formed, weight ten pounds.  Mother doing well thus far.
      I have seen the new moon over my right shoulder to some purpose lately.
   </p>
   
   <p>A few days ago I wrote a letter about you to Secretary Chase<sup><a href="#loc.00875_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>.  I hope you will yet hear from him.  He acknowledged at the time the receipt of
      the book you handed him; so I knew the package must have reached you.  I am heartily
      glad if the books have been put to any use.  How is your friend Brown who was to lose
      his foot?<sup><a href="#loc.00875_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Give my love to the O'Connors.</p>
   
   <p>Good bye.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Townsend Trowbridge
      was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
      Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
      Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
      Eldridge edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He again met Whitman
      in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Secretary Chase in order to
      gather material for his biography, <em>The Ferry Boy and the
         Financier</em> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described their meetings
      in <em>My Own Story, with recollections of noted persons</em>
      (Boston: Houghton and Mifflin, 1903), 360–401. On December 11, Trowbridge
      had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending Whitman; see the . Though
      Trowbridge was not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to O'Connor in 1867: "Every
      year confirms my earliest impression, that no book has approached the power and
      greatness of this book, since the Lear and Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A.
      Coleman, "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <em>American Literature</em>,
      23 [1951–52], 327). For Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Rowman
      and Littlefield, 1961], 3:506. See also Coleman, "Trowbridge and Whitman," <em>Publications of the Modern Language Association of America
         [PMLA]</em>, 63 (1948): 262–273. For several weeks in 1863, Trowbridge
      stayed with Whitman in Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William
      D. O'Connor.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00875_n2">1. As Whitman informed Margaret
      S. Curtis in a letter from , Caleb
      Babbitt suffered a sun stroke in July and was admitted to Armory Square
      Hospital. According to the "Hospital Note Book" (Henry E. Huntington Library),
      Babbitt had been in Mobile, Alabama, earlier. About August 1, 1863, he left
      Washington on furlough. On ,
      Caleb's sister, Mary A. Babbitt informed Whitman of Caleb's arrival in Barre,
      Massachusetts; because of his exhaustion he was unable to write. Mary
      acknowledged Whitman's letter on , and wrote that Caleb was "not quite as well as when I wrote you
      before…he wishes me to tell you to keep writing…for your letters do him more
      good than a great deal of medicine." On , at the expiration of his forty-day furlough, Caleb was strong
      enough to write: "Walt—In your letters you wish me to imagine you talking with
      me when I read them, well I do, and it does very well to think about, but it is
      nothing compared with the original." On , Babbitt was depressed—"dark clouds seem to be lying in my
      pathway and I can not remove them nor hide them from my mind"—until he mentioned
      his beloved, Nellie F. Clark, who "has saved me." On , S. H. Childs wrote for Caleb from the Massachusetts
      General Hospital, Boston: "He Is unable to set up &amp; suffers considerable
      pain In his
      head."

   <p id="loc.00875_n3">2. For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
      John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
      years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an intelligent man who
      deserved something better than the various governmental clerical posts he was to
      hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship, however, was relieved by the
      presence of Whitman whom he was to love and venerate—and defend with a
      single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of vituperation and eulogy that have
      seldom been equaled, most notably in his pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was
      the first, and in many ways the most important, of the adulators who divided
      people arbitrarily into two categories: those who were for and those who were
      against Walt Whitman. The poet praised O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous
      collection of his tales: "He was a born sample here in the 19th century of the
      flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his
      memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton,
      1910] pp. 513). For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>. Of the O'Connors, Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman wrote on : "I am
      real glad, my dear Walt, that you are among such good people. I hope it will be
      in the power of some of our family to return their kindness some day. I'm sure
      twould be done with a heartfelt gratitude. Tis pleasant, too, to think, that
      there are still people of that kind left."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00875_n4">3. Trowbridge refers here to
      the New York publisher, George Carleton. In 1867 Carleton would pass on an
      opportunity to publish a new edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.
      Within about a month, Carleton "had the distinction of turning down both <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and Mark Twain's first book"; Carleton
      later dubbed himself "the prize ass of the nineteenth century." See Justin
      Kaplan, <em>Walt Whitman: A Life</em> (New York: Simon and
      Schuster, 1980), 320.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00875_n5">4. Trowbridge made several
      unsuccessful attempts to secure Whitman a clerkship from Salmon P. Chase,
      Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of Treasury.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00875_n6">5. Lewis Kirke Brown
      (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
      August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
      transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in
      February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on
      February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come
      and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on
      January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary
      (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was employed in the
      Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's letter from 
      . The following
      September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief
      of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until his retirement
      in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was prepared by Brown's
      family and is now held in the Library of Congress.) <a href="#r5">[back]
