   <p>I thought I would write a brief endorsement of your friendly enterprise,<sup><a href="#loc.03543_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> translating and publishing in Germany, some of the poems
      of my <u>Leaves of Grass</u>.<sup><a href="#loc.03543_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> It has
      not been for my own country alone —ambitious as
      the saying so may seem— that I have composed that work. It has been to
      practically start an internationality of poems. The final aim of the United
      States of America is the solidarity of the world. What fails so far, may yet be accomplished
      by song, radiating,
      clustering, concentrating from all the lands of the earth, into a new chorus and
      diapason. One purpose of my chants is to cordially salute all foreign lands in
      America's name. And happy, most happy shall I be, to gain entrance and hearing among
      the great Germanic peoples.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="loc.03543_n1">2. After receiving
      Rolleston's letter of , in which he spoke
      of his plans to publish excerpts from <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and
      in which he asked for Whitman's authorization, Whitman wrote two letters to
      Rolleston. In the first, apparently sent on April 20, he suggested again "the
      printing of the English text with the German" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). The
      second letter, evidently mailed on April 22, though the entry in Whitman's
      Commonplace Book appears under April 20, included an "endorsement to go in R's
      preface—&amp; recommending that <em>Salut au Monde</em> be
      included." Rolleston translated the text of this letter and used it as the
      poet's "endorsement" of his translation; William Sloane Kennedy then translated
      the endorsement from the German back into English in <em>The Fight
         of a Book for the World</em>, 249–250 (reprinted by Horst Frenz in <em>Whitman and Rolleston—A Correspondence</em>
      [Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1951], 89). Rolleston on May 18
      agreed to the poet's suggestions (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r2">[back]
