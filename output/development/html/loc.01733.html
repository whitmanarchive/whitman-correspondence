   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Monckton Milnes (1809–1885), Lord
      Houghton, was an intimate of Tennyson and Thackeray as well as a poet. He was a
      collector of famous people; in <em>Dictionary of National
         Biography</em> he is characterized as "eminently a dilettante." Houghton
      wrote to Joaquin Miller on September 1, 1875, from Chicago: "Please give my best
      regards to Mr Whitman." On ,
      Miller informed Whitman that he was trying to arrange a meeting with Lord
      Houghton. Houghton himself wrote to Whitman on , and proposed a visit at the end of October or early in
      November, and on November 3, 1875, he asked whether November 6 would be
      convenient. See Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> (1906–1996), 1:360, 364; 2:310; <em>In Re
         Walt Whitman</em> (1893), ed. Horace L. Traubel, Richard Maurice Bucke, and
      Thomas B. Harned, 36; and Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in
         England</em> (1934), 141–143.
