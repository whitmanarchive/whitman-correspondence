      <br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Send me word immediately <em>when</em> (day &amp; hour) &amp; <em>where</em> 
      the Paine bust affair is to come off. I see an announcement 
      in the paper that I am to read a poem on the occasion. I do not propose to read a
      poem—but I will promise 
      to be there, &amp; speak just a little (say 10 minutes)—if I can be put on the early part
      of the program 
      (as waiting fags me out entirely)—&amp; perhaps it would be necessary that I should be
      sent for in a carriage. 
      I would advise that you have some good music, &amp; no long-winded address at all. (Couldn't
      you get some 
      good baritone singer to sing Paine's fine lively old song of "the Liberty Tree"?)
      
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00043_n1">1. Damon Y. Kilgore
      (1827–1888) was a well-known Philadelphia lawyer and a member of the
      Liberal League of Philadelphia. In 1875 he prepared a petition to exclude the
      Bible from the public schools. In the following year he married Carrie S.
      Burnham, who was the first woman admitted to the bar in University of
      Pennsylvania. See also Whitman's letters of January 23 and 24, 1877, to Kilgore
      (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–1977], 3:75–76).<a href="#r1">[back]
