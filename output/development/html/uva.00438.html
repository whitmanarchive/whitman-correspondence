   <p>I believe you have in MS one or two clusters of my Notes<sup><a href="#uva.00438_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—<em>yours</em>—they are paid for—I think I
      would like to look over them &amp; touch them up to date (<em>perhaps</em>, or <em>not</em>, I could tell on seeing
      them)—I wish you would send the MS therefore immediately here—&amp; I
      will at once make the improvement-changes, (if any)—&amp; return to
      you—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00438_n1">1. Perhaps the sixth and
      last installment of "How I Get Around at 60, and Take Notes," which appeared in
      <em>The Critic</em> on July 15, 1882 (see the letter from
      Whitman to Jeannette L. Gilder of ). Whitman noted sending the sixth (revised?) article on April 2;
      evidently he returned the galleys of the "Notes" on April 9 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
