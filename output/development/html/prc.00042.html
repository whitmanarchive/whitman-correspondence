      <br></br><br></br>Nelly,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>this is a sad house to-day—little Walt<sup><a href="#prc.00042_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> died last
      evening about ¼ past 8. Partially sick but sudden at last—suddenly turned
      to water on the brain—is to be buried to-morrow afternoon at 4—
   </p>
   
   <p>George and Lou are standing it pretty well—I am miserable—he knew me so
      well—we had already such good times—&amp; I was counting so
      much—My St. Louis nieces are here—they are well—Nelly dear, send
      me back their photos &amp; Jeff's—the heat here has been &amp; is
      dreadful—Love to you—write—
   </p>
