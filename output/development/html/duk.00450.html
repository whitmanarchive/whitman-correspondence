      <br></br><br></br>Dear Bro Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Lou<sup><a href="#n0368" id="r1">1</a></sup> and Jessie<sup><a href="#n1055" id="r2">2</a></sup> came here yesterday—I
      assure you I was 
      gratefull
      
      —They took hold immediately with an energy that has advanced
      household comfort, in one day, than I could have accomplished perhaps all
      winter—brought a woman in the house with mop and pail, and scoured the floor,
      alleviating all that stale, dusty, misty atmosphere—drew out a carpet kept in
      reserve, and we put it down—Lou engineering—to a line—then she
      went away and returned having purchased a new carpet for Han's<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      sleeping rooms, and had a stove for winters use set up—bought an arm chair, a
      pair of shades, and had the old
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>old lounge or sofa taken away to be 
      repaird
      
       in the best possible manner, but a 
      matrass
      
       for me, cotton and stuff—better perhaps than I had—the stove
      was put in place in our best room—a good heater. The women worked, and so did
      I, until the best shirt I had was 
      ript
      
      , in rags—I told Lou that I had no other—true—she told
      Han that she had intended to have given her some money but could not—she had
      none left.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wished that she had left 25 dollars for the taxes—but alas—numerous
      persons have contributed, a dollar 
      occasionaly
      
      , to keep us up—beside your kind remittances—Oh! good friend
      Walt. Han is pretty well—
   </p>

      Yours gratefully—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0368">1. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
