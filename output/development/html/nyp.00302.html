      <br></br><br></br>Dear Nelly,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter has reached me this morning—&amp;, as always, is welcome—I shall <em>not go on</em> to Boston—am not well enough 
      (&amp; the hot spell besides)—but shall send the piece I have composed 
      for the occasion—a ten or fifteen minute piece I call the "Song of the Universal"—to
      be read by proxy in its place in the programme, just the same as though I were there.
      
      I will next week send it you in print<sup><a href="#nyp.00302_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am only reconciled to Charles Eldridge's <em>not</em> coming to see me Decoration Day, by taking it 
      for granted that he will consequently feel bound to visit me without fail before long—Come,
      Charley, by all means—It will do me good—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nelly, John Burroughs has had a terrible &amp; sudden sorrow befall him—the sudden insanity
      &amp; death 
      of his young nephew, his dead sister's son, (he visited me here during the past winter)
      Chancy Burroughs,<sup><a href="#nyp.00302_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> at Brooklyn two weeks since—Abruptly, mysteriously, from <em>apparent</em> health &amp; strength he became 
      a raging maniac &amp; died in three days—&amp; J. B. took up the poor young man's corpse &amp;
      buried him 
      by his mother's side, there in the mountains of Delaware County—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If I remember right the picture in the gilt frame is the one with the hand up at the
      right side of the head—so? If so, I have some of them, &amp; will give Mrs. Johnson one
      with the greatest pleasure—(it is one of 
      Brady's photos)—I wish you to give my best respects &amp; love to Mrs. J. and sister—Also
      to Garry Howard, 
      Mrs. Huntington, Mrs. Brownell &amp; in fact to "all inquiring friends"—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I still maintain the "great expectations" I have before mentioned—the severe gastric
      affection, 
      trouble in side &amp; breast, &amp;c still assert themselves at times—dyspepsia, from 17 months
      inaction—but upon the whole not so severely—&amp; I think very decidedly gradually growing
      less—The worst is my singular alternations, fluctuations. The heat here too is &amp; has
      been extreme—but I am standing it well, so far—to-day as I sit here writing, a fair
      breeze blowing in—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Peter Doyle has ten days since paid me a short visit of a couple of days<sup><a href="#nyp.00302_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—the dear, dear boy—&amp; what good it did me!—(Unfortunately it was, however, 
      at a time when I was feeling almost at my worst.) Yesterday George Bacon came, bringing
      a friend—&amp; we had a capital good hour &amp; a half—<em>talked Spiritualism</em>—I enjoyed it though—
   </p>

   <p id="nyp.00302_n2">2. "Song of the Universal"
      appeared in the New York <em>Daily Graphic</em> on ; in the <em>Evening
         Post</em> on ; in the Springfield
      <em>Republican</em> on June 18, 1874; in the New York <em>World</em> on June 19, 1874; and in the Camden <em>New Republic</em> on June 20, 1874. According to the
      Springfield <em>Republican</em>, the poem was read by Prof. Brown
      "probably better than the poet himself would have rendered it…The
      poem…is very Whitmany, being one of the most grotesque in expression and
      one of the richest and subtlest in thought which he has put out for a long
      time."<a href="#r2">[back]
