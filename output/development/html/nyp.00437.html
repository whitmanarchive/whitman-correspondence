   <p>This is the best I can do about <em>the Ruskin</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00437_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—you will have to pick out from the letters
      (especially what I have lined with the red ink)—I get <em>lots
         of letters</em>—these are samples more or less<sup><a href="#nyp.00437_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I am well—(I can't send your book till Monday)—

   <p id="nyp.00437_n2">2. On , O'Connor wanted to know "just what
      Ruskin said about L. of G., for I discover that it was to you, or some near
      friend of yours, that he wrote" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press,
      1953], 4:21). Whitman forwarded to O'Connor three letters from William Harrison
      Riley, dated , , and , and one
      from Herbert J. Bathgate, written on . Riley and Bathgate were friends of Ruskin (see Whitman's letter
      to Riley of  and his letter to John
      Burroughs of ). O'Connor returned
      these letters to Whitman on .
      O'Connor's copies are in the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York
