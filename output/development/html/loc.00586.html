   <p>Perhaps you have forgotten a wild farmer's scarecrow [illegible] man who used to linger around Thayer &amp; Eldridges Publishing office Boston in the
      spring of 1860  But he still remembers you and has been waiting very patiently for
      a volume of Leaves of Grass which was to be sent to Lawrence Kansas Perhaps you think
      I am writing rather familiar for almost a stranger and writing to a distinguished
      Poet but I think I have made a sufficient appology when I tell you I have been in the Rocky Mountains for almost two years where every man is an old acquaintance if
      you never saw him before
   </p>
   
   <p>When I left Boston I came to Kansas and from there out here among Grizzly bears, Indians
      Yankees and almost every species of man and beast that inhabit the globe. I have lived
      on venison and I have lived on bread I have gone hungry for many a day and have had
      plenty to eat for many more, and for all the hardships I have seen it suits me,&nbsp;I
      like it &nbsp;I enjoy myself hugely, and I think you would do the same
   </p>
   
   <p>I now hold the position of 1st Lieut of Co K 1st Reg Col Vols<sup><a href="#loc.00586_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> and suppose I shall be a soldier for the next few years
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have often heard Leaves of Grass highly spoken of away out here but have never seen
      a volume until a few days ago and the man who has that will not dispose of that for
      any price he brought it out with him to this country.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am in an old log shanty to night away up in the mountains about forty miles from
      the valley the wind blows a perfect hurracane and it is cold as Greenland  I am writing by the light of a pitch pine fire, it is
      past twelve oclock and I must go to bed as I must start for the valley in the morning.
      I dont want you to forget to answer this. Good night

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Silas S. Soule
      (1838â€“1865) was raised by an abolitionist father, Amasa Soule, who moved
      the Soule family to Kansas to help fight for Kansas's anti-slavery status. With
      his father and brother William, Silas was a member of the "Jayhawkers," a band
      of abolitionists who assisted slaves through the Underground Railroad. Silas was
      among the Kansas team assembled and brought to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania by
      Richard Swinton to break John Brown's accomplices Albert Hazlett and Aaron
      Stevens out of jail in Charlestown, Virginia (now West Virginia). In Harrisburg
      he would have met William W. Thayer, who helped Richard Hinton and Thomas
      Wentworth Higginson plan the jailbreak. On February 18, 1860, Soule went to
      Charlestown from Harrisburg and faked public intoxication in order to be
      imprisoned in the same jail as Hazlett and Stevens, only to be talked out of the
      jailbreak by them. Soule attended a public memorial for Hazlett and Stevens in
      Boston, where Thayer and Eldridge were in attendance. After the death of his
      father in 1860, Soule followed the gold rush to Denver, but enlisted in the
      Union army as soon as news of the war reached him. In 1864 Soule defied orders
      by refusing to join Colonel John M. Chivington's attack on a group of unarmed
      Native Americans, which later came to be known as the Sand Creek Massacre. Soule
      would later testify against Chivington in hearings in Denver. Soule married
      Hersa Coberly, the daughter of a pioneer family, on April 1, 1865. Three weeks
      later he was murdered on the streets of downtown Denver by a private from the
      Second Colorado infantry and an accomplice.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00586_n2">1. Organized by the territory's
      first governor, William Gilpin, Company K, 1st Regiment Colorado Volunteers
      began enlisting in August 1861. Nicknamed "Gilpin's Pet Lambs" because of the
      governor's involvement in their organization, the regiment marched to northern
      New Mexico from February 1862 to March 1862. There they fought in the battles of
      Apache Canyon and Pigeon's Ranch (also called the Battle of Glorieta Pass) and
      at Peralta, New Mexico. Their first colonel was John P. Slough, who resigned and
      was replaced by Major John M. Chivington in April 1862. The regiment's first and
      only lieutenant-colonel was Samuel F. Tappan.<a href="#r1">[back]
