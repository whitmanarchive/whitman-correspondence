   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00177_n8">1. This letter dates to
      November 16, 1868. Neither the executors nor Edwin Haviland Miller dated this
      letter (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 2:366). The letter, however, dates to
      death of Charley Mann, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's neighbor, in 1868, and
      November 16 is in her hand. Louisa discussed Charley Mann's death in her  letter to Walt Whitman, and she
      describes visitors to the Mann household after the funeral in this
      letter.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n3">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00177_n12">3. Walt Whitman's November
      15?, 1868 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant. Edwin Haviland
      Miller did not list it among Walt's lost letters (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:361).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">5. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00177_n4">6. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      phonetic spelling "mobeal" refers to Mobile, Alabama. The Mann
      family—though Louisa spelled the name "man"—lived downstairs from
      Louisa. In her  letter, Louisa
      informed Walt Whitman of the death of "little Charley man" due to diphtheria and
      croup. Mary E. Mann's  letter to
      Louisa (Feinberg Collection, Library of Congress), presumably Charley Mann's
      mother, confirms the spelling of the name is "Mann."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00550_n4">7. Charles L. Heyde
      (1822–1892) a landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman
      (1823–190), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's second daughter, and they lived in
      Burlington, Vermont.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00177_n16">8. The last letter of the word
      "would" is not visible in the image. The letter is pasted into a manuscript
      book, and the final letters on the edge closest to the binding in the page image
      are often obscured. Most of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman manuscript letters in the
      bound volume entitled <em>Walt Whitman: A Series of Thirteen
         Letters from His Mother to Her Son</em>, held at the Harry Ransom Center,
      have obscured text on at least one page. Text from this page was recorded based
      on an examination of the physical volume, which allowed more text to be
      recovered.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00177_n7">9. A Rebecca Denton Van Velsor
      (1791?–1871) has a memorial stone in Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery. The
      woman buried in Green-Wood, who may have been Walt Whitman's "Aunt Becca," is
      listed as the wife of a Joseph Van Velsor (1792–1859), possibly a brother
      or uncle to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Aunt Becca is mentioned also in Louisa's
       and  letters to Walt.<a href="#r9">[back]
