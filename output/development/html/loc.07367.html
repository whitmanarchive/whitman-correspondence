   <p>Over two weeks ago I determined to let Major Pond<sup><a href="#n3112" id="r1">1</a></sup> manage your
      lecture.<sup><a href="#med.00797_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> He is "up" in that kind of business and
      knows just how to do it. He said I might calculate three hundred and fifty dollars
      as the cost—the output, and he would guarantee to fill a hall. I at once
      assumed the responsibility and became security for the three hundred and fifty
      dollars. He then tried to get Chickering Hall but it was engaged for April 14th and
      also for every afternoon and evening about that date. We have at last settled upon
      the Madison Square Theatre for the afternoon (four o'clock) of April 14th.<sup><a href="#loc.07367_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> I must pay the seventy five dollars for the Theatre the
      moment it is engaged, and I will do so the moment I receive a telegram from you
      to-morrow saying, "all right, go ahead." Please wire me at once on receipt of
      this.
   </p>
   
   <p>Alma<sup><a href="#n4982" id="r4">4</a></sup> is here with me and is well and says: "Lots of love and
      thanks for the nice letter received at Equinunk.<sup><a href="#loc.07367_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup>"

      Ever yours sincerely

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3112">1. James Burton Pond (1838–1903)
      was a famous lecture-manager and printer. He was also awarded the Medal of Honor
      for his services in the Civil War. In his 1900 autobiography <em>Eccentricities of Genius</em> (G. W. Dillingham Co: New York), he writes
      about Whitman: "Walt Whitman gave a few readings under my management during his
      life. They were mostly testimonials from friends, and benefits given in the
      theatres of New York City"; he concludes with an anecdote about the poet's
      meeting with Sir Edwin Arnold (p. 497–501).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00797_n1">2. This is referring to
      Whitman's lecture entitled "The Death of Abraham Lincoln." He first delivered
      this lecture in New York in 1879 and would deliver it at least eight other times
      over the succeeding years, delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He
      had published a version of the lecture as "Death of Abraham Lincoln" in <em>Specimen Days</em> (1882–83). For more on the lecture,
      see Larry D. Griffin, "'Death of Abraham Lincoln,'" <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, ed.,
      (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998), 169–170.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07367_n1">3. The Lincoln lecture was a
      tremendous success, and Whitman was so showered with adulation that he observed
      in the Commonplace Book: "If I had staid longer, I sh'd have been killed with
      kindness &amp; compliments" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]

      and the second wife of John H. Johnston.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.07367_n2">5. Equinunk is a village in
      northeastern Pennsylvania, where Alma Calder Johnston's family, for much of the
      nineteenth century, owned a home and large tract of land.<a href="#r5">[back]
