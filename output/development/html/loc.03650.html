      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>'77</p> 
   
   
   <p>I have had joyful news today; Percy's wife has a fine little boy—it was born on the 10th, and Norah got through well &amp;
      is doing nicely—so I feel very happy—
   </p>
   
   <p>Since then Per has gone to Paris where he is to read a paper before the "Iron and Steel Institute,"
      on the Elimination of phosphorus from Iron"—which is also a little triumph of another
      kind for him—for the Council which accepted his paper is composed of eminent English
      Scientists &amp; eminent foreign ones will hear it.—I need not tell 
       
      you it is indescribably lovely here now—no doubt Kirkwood is the same—the light so
      brilliant and yet soft—the rich autumn tints just beginning to appear—the temperature
      delicious—crisp &amp; bracing, yet genial—
   </p>
   
   <p>The throng of people is gone—but a few of the pleasantest of the old set remain—&amp;
      a few interesting new ones have come—among them Mrs. Dexter from Boston, who was a
      Miss Ticknor, daughter of the author of the book on Spanish literature—she and her
      husband full of interesting talk—Also Mr Martin [
      <span class="unclear">Busines?</span>]
       and his 
      
      wife—a fine specimen of a leading Bostonian—Besides these also a Physician from Florida
      whom I much admire—with a beautiful firm tenor voice—very handsome &amp; graceful too
      a true southerner I should 
      say—(but of Scotch extraction).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Next week we go to Boston—</p>
   
   
   <p>I went over the Lunatic Asylum here the other day &amp; saw some strange sad sights—some
      figures crouched down in attitudes of such profound dejection I shall never forget
      them—some very bright &amp; talkative. It is said to be the best managed in America. Dr.
      Earle, who is at the head, is a man of 
       
      splendid capacity for the post—a noble looking old man (uncle of those Miss Chases
      you met at our house)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I can't settle to anything or think of any thing since I 
      received Per's letter but the baby &amp; Norah—
   </p>
   
   <p>Love to you &amp; to Mrs. Whitman &amp; Hattie &amp; Jessie.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
