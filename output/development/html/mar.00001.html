   <p>I am puzzled considerably—Nov 12 I sent you from here the proof of "Eminent
      Visitors"<sup><a href="#mar.00001_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—See by the paper of 17th the errors
      I marked were not corrected—Same note I requested some proof slips of the E.
      V. article—None have reached me. Nov: 19 I wrote you (reiterating the
      above &amp;) saying as I could probably not now be furnished with proof slips I
      would like a dozen copies of the paper—No response to either of the letters—Didnt
      
       they reach you?<sup><a href="#mar.00001_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
