      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I am writing to you on the spur of the moment in hopes it will bring me to my
      senses, for I am quite stunned at the first glance of London.
      I have just come from St. Pauls
      &amp; feel very strange. I don't
      know what is the matter with me but I seem in a dream. St. Pauls was too much for me
      &amp; my brain actually reels. I have never seen architecture before. It made me
      drunk
   </p>
   
   <p>I have seen a building with a living soul, I can't tell you about it  now. I saw for the
      first time what power &amp; imagination could be put in form &amp; design—I
      felt for a moment what great genius was in this field.
      But I had to retreat after sitting
      down a half hour and trying to absorb it. I feel as if I should go no where else
      while in London. I must master it or it will kill me. I actually grew faint. I was
      not prepared for it &amp; I though my companions the Treasury clerks would drive me
      mad they rushed round so, I had to leave them &amp; sit down. Hereafter I must go
      alone everywhere. My brain is too sensitive. I am not strong enough to confront
      these things all at once. I would
      give anything  if you
      was here. I see now that you belong here—these things are akin to your spirit. You
      would see your own in St. Pauls, but it took my breath away. It was more than I
      could bear &amp; I will have to gird up my loins &amp; try it many times. Outside it
      has the beauty &amp; grandeur of rocks and crags and ledges.
      It is nature &amp; art fused into
      one. Of course time has done much for it, it is so stained and weather worn. It is
      like a Rembrandt picture so strong &amp; deep is the light &amp; shade. It is more
      to see the old world than I had dreamed, much more. I thought art was of little
      account, but now I get a glimpse of the real article I am overwhelmed. I had  designed to go on the
      continent, but I shall not stir out of London till I have vanquished some part of
      it at least. If I loose my wits here why go further? But I shall make a brave fight.
      I only wish I had help. These fellows are like monkeys. I have seen no one yet but
      shall try to find  Conway to morrow.
      I write you
      this dear Walt to help recover myself. I know it
      contains nothing you might expect to hear from me in London, but I have got into
      Niagara without knowing it &amp; you must bear with me. I will give facts &amp;
      details next time. Go &amp; see Ursula. 
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With much love,
      <br></br>John Burroughs
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Oct 4—I went to day to see Conway but he was
      not in—so I went back to St Pauls to see if I really made a fool of myself
      yesterday. I did not feel as before &amp; perhaps never shall again, yet it is
      truly grand &amp; there is no mistake.
      It is like the grandest
      organ music put into form
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>P. S. I hope you &amp; O'Connor will really make an effort to come over here. You need
      not mention it but I know it is not settled at all who will come. This you can rely
      upon, but there will be no more bonds sent till November.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
