   <p>I am about the same to-day, rather on the improve—have not tried to get out any
      more—feel pretty much depressed about Mat's death,<sup><a href="#nyp.00309_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> (but it
      has been to her no doubt a relief from great pain)—Have just written a few lines to
      Jeff<sup><a href="#nyp.00309_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Wrote yesterday to Han<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Mother, you must not get gloomy. Feel better as I write—I am sitting up by
      the stove. 
   </p>

      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt
