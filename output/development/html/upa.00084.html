      is postmarked: CAMDEN | DEC | 12 | 5 PM | (?) | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="upa.00084_n2">2. These sums are explained
      in Herbert's letter of : he had sent
      £2.10 for Richard Colles (see the letter from Whitman to Colles of ); £5 from Leonard M. Brown
      (see the letter from Whitman to Brown of ); and 14s. 6d. from Cambridge friends. Herbert was hurt: "You
      make no allusion to my Book or my little confidences thereon! do you care for a
      copy?" Undoubtedly he was referring to the fact that Whitman had not replied to
      his letters of , , and , in which he recounted his difficulties in publishing the biography
      of his mother. In the letter of  he
      observed: "I am so sorry that I have finished my labour of love, the doing of
      the Biography has been the greatest imaginable comfort and solace to
      me,—in a sense it has given me another year of her companionship."<a href="#r2">[back]
