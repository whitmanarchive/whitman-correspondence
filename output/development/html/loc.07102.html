   </p>
   
   <p>I have yours of yesterday and enclose a list of the subscribers. I cannot send the
      amounts since it was understood that the individual sums should not be made known
      and some of the largest givers expressly made that stipulation, on the ground that
      it might be unjust to those who could give but little and yet in proportion gave
      even more largely than
      themselves. You will see that some are from outside Boston. Mrs. Van Renssalaer is,
      I believe, the only representative of New York, but if there had been anybody there
      to take hold we could have got many, I am confident. Mrs. Van R. is a genuine friend
      and hearing of the project specially send me word 
      she wished to subscribe. She was visiting here then.
   </p>
   
   <p>Saw Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r2">2</a></sup> yesterday: has been working hard reading proof. Saw Dr. Bartol the
      other day and he spoke warmly of you.
   </p>
   
   <p>What glorious October weather!</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sylvester Baxter (1850â€“1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850â€“1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="n3039">2. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850â€“1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149â€“158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850â€“1929)</a>," <em>Walt

      (1827â€“1916) was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and
      anti-slavery reformer. Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry
      in 1855, he did not meet Whitman until 1860, when the poet was in Boston
      overseeing the Thayer and Eldridge edition of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>. For several weeks in 1863, Trowbridge stayed with Whitman in
      Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William D. O'Connor.<a href="#r3">[back]

      Andrew's son John Forester Andrew. On , G. P. Lathrop wrote to Walt Whitman: "I think you have
      corresponded with Albert Otis, a lawyer of Boston, whom I know." A biographical
      sketch of Otis appeared in <em>Memorial Biographies of the New

      the decree was altered, and O'Reilly was sent to Australia, where he escaped on
      an American whaler in 1869. In 1876 he became the coeditor of the Boston <em>Pilot</em>, a position which he held until his death in 1890.
      See William G. Schofield, <em>Seek for a Hero: The Story of John
         Boyle O'Reilly</em> (New York: Kennedy, 1956). On  O'Reilly informed Whitman that "James R Osgood wants to see
      the material for your complete book." Whitman's letter to Osgood was written, as
      he indicated, on the verso of O'Reilly's.<a href="#r10">[back]

   <p id="n0915">30. Franklin B. Sanborn
      (1831â€“1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
      he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
      the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
      reviewed <em>Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Boston
         Commonwealth</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00059.html">February 24, 1866</a>. He was editor of the <em>Springfield

      approximately 250 sonnets. She has been described as "a lady well-known in

      also wrote several book notices for the <em>Boston

      Boston in 1863. Though it introduced such authors as Dante Gabriel Rossetti,
      William Morris, Joaquin Miller, Oscar Wilde, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Emily
      Dickinson, it became famous for the works of Louisa May Alcott. <em>After All, Not to Create Only</em> was the only work of Walt
      Whitman that the firm published. It has been suggested that Bronson Alcott
      persuaded Roberts to undertake the work; see Raymond L. Kilgour, <em>Messrs. Roberts Brothers, Publishers</em> (1952), 107. The
      house merged with Little, Brown and Co. in 1898.<a href="#r35">[back]

      (1850â€“1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149â€“158.
