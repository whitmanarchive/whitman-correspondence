      <br></br><br></br>Charles Hine,
      <br></br>Dear, dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall try and come to New Haven, very soon—though but for perhaps two or three
      hours. For some days past my mother has been ill—some of the time very
      ill—and I have been nurse &amp; doctor too, as none of my sisters are home at
      present—But to-day she seems over it, if the favorable symptoms continue.<sup><a href="#prc.00092_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I have procured the portrait &amp; frame without any trouble,<sup><a href="#prc.00092_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; they are now hanging up in mother's front room—&amp; are the delight
      &amp; ever-increasing gratification of my folks &amp; friends, young &amp;
      old—some of whom sit by the half hour &amp; just look steadily at it in
      silence—It is indeed a noble piece of 
      work-manship—age has already improved it, &amp; will still more—both painting
      &amp; frame were unharmed—Mr. Blondell, 806 Broadway, had the painting, &amp; has
      others of yours.<sup><a href="#prc.00092_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Charley, I cannot fix the day, but I will indeed try to come forthwith. I too
      wish
      to be with you once more—though it will be but so briefly<sup><a href="#prc.00092_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Much love to you, my dear friend,—not forgetting your wife &amp; children.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Hine
      (1827–1871) was the painter who created the oil painting from which the
      engraving that become the frontispiece for the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> was made. In a letter now lost, Whitman appears to
      have received word from Hine that he was very ill. On , Whitman wrote to William D. O'Connor that an "artist friend
      of mine is very low there with consumption—is in fact dying."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00092_n2">1. In letters written the
      same day to  and , Whitman describes caring for
      his mother in almost identical terms.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00092_n3">2. It appears that Hine
      gave the portrait he had painted of Whitman to him as a dying gift.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00092_n4">3. Jacob D. Blondel
      (1817–1877), one of Hine's acquaintances and a fellow portrait painter;
      Dodworth Hall at 806 Broadway in New York City was one of several buildings in
      which artists rented studio space from the 1850s to 1870s. Whitman's old friend
      Jesse Talbot rented space there at the same time as Hine.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00092_n5">4. On July 26, Whitman
      started out for New Haven and stayed that night and all the next day with Hine.
      On , he wrote Peter Doyle, "I thought he
      would die while I was there—he was all wasted to a skeleton, faculties
      good, but voice only a low whisper—I returned last night, after
      midnight—" Within ten days, Hine died. On , his wife wrote to Whitman: "It is useless for me to tell you how
      strong his affection was for you, and how he has looked forward to you coming to
      N.H. I think that after your visit to him that his hold on life seemed to give
      way and his yearnings were all accomplished" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 9 vols., 3:330).<a href="#r4">[back]
