      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We have just come off Picket, &nbsp;everything along the river and in the camp is just
      the same as when you left,<sup><a href="#duk.00334_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &nbsp;I am still liveing in Capt Francis's<sup><a href="#duk.00334_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> tent as I have not been able to get one of my own. I have been expecting every day
      that we would get orders to move our camp, where we could get wood and water, without
      going as far for it, as we have to here. Once we had orders to be ready to move the
      next morning but before morning came, the orders were countermanded,
   </p>
   
   <p>I have had Two letters from you since you left, and Two from home and this morning
      I got one from Heyde. All at home seems to be going on well, Jeff writes strong for
      me to resign and come home<sup><a href="#duk.00334_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &nbsp;Heyde writes that Hannah is quite sick and almost helpless, &nbsp;Poor Han I am afraid
      she has a hard life, &nbsp;as for Heyde, he is certainly a fool, and I think a scoundrell. He writes me a great deal of stuff about Han &nbsp;and among other devilish lies he says
      that he is told that on Han's last visit home, Mother told her She must never turn
      her thoughts there for a home again. The whole tenor of his letter shows that he wants to get rid of her, and I
      am sure she must be liveing in a perfect Hell. He says that while he was gone away she was taken worse and had
      to depend on the Neighbors to take care of her, and that some aquaintance of hers was about writing to her friends, to let them know how she was situated,
      &nbsp;Walt you or Jeff must certainly go on there and see how things are, and make some
      arangements for bringing her home. If <em>you</em> can go &nbsp;write on to mother and have her send you some money and dont fail to attend to it immediately as I feel quite worried about Han.
   </p>
   
   <p>I received a Brooklyn Eagle yesterday with your letter published,<sup><a href="#duk.00334_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &nbsp;I send you 50 cts which I wish you to buy Postage stamps with, and send them to
      me as soon as conveinent, as we cant buy any here. Capt Sims and all the rest are well and hearty. I got a
      letter from boss Rac<sup><a href="#duk.00334_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> a few days since.
   </p>
   
   <p>Let me hear from you as soon as you get this and tell me what you propose to do in
      regard to Han. I will write again soon.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
