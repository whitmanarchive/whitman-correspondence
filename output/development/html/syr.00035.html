      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I see in the papers, with agitation and alarm, the reports about your illness, which,
      however, are so vague that I can hope they are exaggerations, and that you are no
      worse than when you sent me the postal card of the 18th of May.<sup><a href="#syr.00035_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> You were bad enough then, God knows, and I felt downcast
      at your condition, though trusting that it was no more than an ill turn, which would
      pass. I would have written to you earlier, but have had several hideous days myself,
      and been unfit to write.
   </p>
   
   <p>One paper speaks of Mr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> as being with you. I hope this is
      <em>Doctor</em> Bucke, and that he may have come down to you from
      Canada.<sup><a href="#syr.00035_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I wait anxiously to hear how you are. If I were not so badly
      crippled—especially the last few days—I would try to come and hear for
      myself. But I should be in the way, considering my condition.
   </p>
   
   <p>If Doctor Bucke is with you, I hope he will pencil me a word, if he can.</p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Hurriedly, but with fervent hopes and wishes, always affectionately
      <br></br>W.D. O'Connor.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
