   <p>The scope and spirit of your paper on Democracy delight and satisfy me beyond all expectation, and I write without compliment or
      reserve to the man, the American Columbus, whose sagacity has thus sounded adventurously
      the sea of our Social Chaos and anchored his thought securely in soil of the newly
      discovered Atlantides about which Grecian Plato died dreaming. Especially have I to thank you for delivering such doughty thrusts into the sides
      of the British Behemoth sending him bottomwards. All you say of the Imperial West is strong and IS.

   <p>I talked last evening with Emerson about your strong strokes at the thoughtless literature and Godless faith of this
      East—nothing as yet to show of original type—wholly null and empty of ideas—only Thoreau
      to redeem it from idiocy and fatuity.
   </p>
   <p>That dutiful drill of yours, too, in Humanity during the dread struggle of these last
      years gives to your thought a sanction and potency which Universities cannot claim
      nor confer

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Amos Bronson Alcott
      (1799–1888) was an American educator, abolitionist, and father of Louisa
      May Alcott (1832–1888), whose 1868 novel <em>Little
         Women</em> (loosely based on the Alcott home) secured the financial
      stability her father had been unable to achieve through his own work as a
      teacher and transcendentalist. See also <em>The Journals of
         Bronson Alcott</em>, ed. Odell Shepard (Boston: Little, Brown, 1938),
      286–290.
