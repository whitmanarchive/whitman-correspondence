   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Swinton (1829–1901), a journalist and
      friend of Karl Marx, became acquainted with Whitman during the Civil War.
      Swinton, managing editor of the <em>New York Times</em>,
      frequented Pfaff's, where he probably met Whitman. Whitman's correspondence with
      Swinton began on . Swinton's
      enthusiasm for Whitman was unbounded. On , Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly impressed with the great
      humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you. I read this afternoon in
      the book. I read its first division which I never before read. I could convey no
      idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more to me than all other books and
      poetry." On , Swinton wrote what
      the poet termed "almost like a love letter": "It was perhaps the very day of the
      publication of the first edition of the 'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of
      it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street, Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it
      with wonder, and felt that here was something that touched on depths of my
      humanity. Since then you have grown before me, grown around me, and grown into
      me" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.13.html">Tuesday, April 10, 1888</a>). He praised Whitman in the <em>New York Herald</em> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke,
      <em>Walt Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
      36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
      for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <em>New York Sun</em>, and for the next four years edited the
      weekly labor journal, <em>John Swinton's Paper</em>. When this
      publication folded, he returned to the <em>Sun</em>. See Robert
      Waters, <em>Career and Conversations of John Swinton</em>
      (Chicago: C.H. Kerr, 1902), and Meyer Berger, <em>The History of
         The New York Times, 1851–1951</em> (New York: Simon and Schuster,
      1951), 250–251. See also Donald Yannella, "Swinton, John
      (1829–1901)," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed.

      1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00306_n1">1. Jeff suggested on , that Whitman write to John
      Swinton: "Now, Walt, if you will remember among the first men that blowed for
      Grant and wrote him up, so to speak, was our friend John Swinton. . . . Now I am
      positive that a letter could be got from Swinton to Grant signed as Editor of
      the Times asking that a special exchange might be made in George's case."
      Swinton replied to Whitman on ,
      and included a letter to Grant in which he closely paraphrased Whitman's letter.
      In a lost letter, Whitman informed his family that he had written to Swinton,
      and, on , Jeff replied that "we are all
      very joyful," and that Dr. Ruggles had visited Swinton "to urge him to write to
      Gen Grant." According to George M. Williamson, with Whitman's letter there is
      another from Lieutenant Colonel E. S. Parker, Grant's military secretary, dated
      February 13, 1865, informing Swinton that the cases of the two officers "had
      been ordered to be made a subject of special exchange" (<em>Catalogue of a Collection of Books, Letters, and Manuscripts Written by
         Walt Whitman</em> [Jamaica, New York: The Marion Press, 1903]). Swinton
      endorsed the envelope: "W. W. 1865 Asking me to help his captured brother.
      Successful."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="med.00306_n2">2. Whitman overstated, for
      on the same day Jeff, who took nothing calmly, wrote from Brooklyn: "Mother is
      quite well—I think to-day [she] seems in better spirits than usual" (Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, ).<a href="#r2">[back]
