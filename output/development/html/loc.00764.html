      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Nothing new—still I thought I would write you a line this morning. The $4, namely:
      $2 from Theo. A. Drake and 2 [from] John D. Martin,<sup><a href="#loc.00764_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> enclosed in your letter of the 10th came safe. They too will please accept the grateful
      thanks of several poor fellows, in hospital here.
   </p>
   
   <p>The letter of introduction to Mr. Webster,<sup><a href="#loc.00764_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> chief clerk, State Department, will be very acceptable. If convenient, I should like
      Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00764_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> to send it on immediately. I do not so much look for an appointment from Mr. Seward
      as his backing me from the State of New York. I have seen Preston King<sup><a href="#loc.00764_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> this morning for the second time—(it is very amusing to hunt for an office—so the
      thing seems to me just now—even if one don't get it)—I have seen Charles Sumner three
      times—he says every thing here moves as part of a great machine, and that I must consign
      myself to the fate of the rest—still [in] an interview I had with him yesterday he
      talked and acted as though he had life in him, and would exert himself to any reasonable extent for me to get something. Meantime I make about enough
      to pay my expenses by hacking on the press here, and copying in the paymasters offices,
      a couple of hours a day—one thing is favorable here, namely, pay for whatever one
      does is at a high rate—I have not yet presented my letters to either Seward or Chase<sup><a href="#loc.00764_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I thought I would get my forces all in a body, and make one concentrated dash, if
      possible with the personal introduction and presence of some big bug—I like fat old
      Preston King, very much—he is fat as a hogshead, with great hanging chops—the first
      thing he said to me the other day in the parlor chamber of the Senate, when I sent
      in for him and he came out, was, "Why, how can I do this thing, or any thing for you—how
      do I know but you are a secessionist—you look for all the world, like an old Southern
      planter—a regular Carolina or Virginia planter." I treated him with just as much hauteur
      as he did me with bluntness—this was the first time—it afterward proved that Charles
      Sumner had not prepared the way for me, as I supposed, or rather, not so strongly as I supposed, and Mr. King had
      even forgotten it—so I was as an entire stranger. But the same day C. S. talked further
      with Mr. King in the Senate, and the second interview I had with the latter, (this
      forenoon) he has given me a sort of general letter, endorsing me from New York—one
      envelope is addressed to Secretary Chase, and another to Gen. Meigs,<sup><a href="#loc.00764_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> head Quartermaster's Dep't. Meantime, I am getting better and better acquainted with
      office-hunting wisdom, and Washington peculiarities generally.
   </p>
   
   <p>I spent several hours in the Capitol the other day—the incredible gorgeousness of
      some of the rooms, (interior decorations &amp;c)—rooms used perhaps but for merely three
      or four Committee meetings in the course of the whole year,) is beyond one's flightiest
      dreams. Costly frescoes of the style of Taylor's Saloon in Broadway,<sup><a href="#loc.00764_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> only really the best and choicest of their sort, done by imported French &amp; Italian
      artists, are the prevailing sorts (imagine the work you see on the fine China vases,
      in Tiffany's—the paintings of Cupids &amp; goddesses &amp;c. spread recklessly over the arched
      ceiling and broad panels of a big room—the whole floor underneath paved with tesselated pavement, which is a sort of cross between marble &amp; china, with little figures drab,
      blue, cream color, &amp;c). These things, with heavy, elaborately wrought balustrades, columns, &amp; steps—all of
      the most beautiful marbles I ever saw, some white as milk, others of all colors, green,
      spotted, lined, or of our old chocolate color—all these marbles used as freely as
      if they were common blue flags—with rich door-frames and window-casings of bronze
      and gold—heavy chandeliers and mantels, and clocks in every room—and indeed by far
      the richest and gayest, and most un-American and inappropriate ornamenting and finest
      interior workmanship I ever conceived possible, spread in profusion through scores,
      hundreds, (and almost thousands) of rooms—such are what I find, or rather would find
      to interest me, if I devoted time to it—But a few of the rooms are enough for me—the
      style is without grandeur, and without simplicity—These days, the state our country
      is in, and especially filled as I am from top to toe, of late with scenes and thoughts
      of the hospitals, (America seems to me now, though only in her youth, but brought
      already here feeble, bandaged and bloody in hospital)—these days I say, Jeff, all
      the poppy-show goddesses and all the pretty blue &amp; gold in which the interior Capitol
      is got up, seem to me out of place beyond any thing I could tell—and I get away from
      it as quick as I can when that kind of thought comes over me. I suppose it is to be
      described throughout—those interiors—as all of them got up in the French style—well
      enough for a New York [incomplete]

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00764_n1">1. Jeff enclosed the
      contributions from these employees of Moses Lane on . The Brooklyn Directory of 1865–66 listed
      Drake as an inspector in City Hall. Martin was listed in the Directory of
      1861–62 as a surveyor, but was not cited in 1865–66. Lane enclosed a
      contribution of $1 from Martin in a letter on .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00764_n2">2. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
      and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter of
      , and later various sums which
      Whitman acknowledged in letters from , , , and . In his letter of , Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in the
      Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman wrote,
      obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of money,
      contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly
      through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted Whitman
      in other ways as well (see Whitman's letter from ). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal
      welfare that on , he sent through
      Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00764_n3">3. Lane wrote to E. D.
      Webster on February 12: "Mr. W[hitman] has been for a long time connected with
      the New York Press and is a writer of most decided ability. His patriotism and
      loyalty you can rely upon under all circumstances. . . . I thought possibly you
      might assist him on the score of our old acquaintance" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection). In his letter on ,
      Jeff reported that Lane "tells me that he (Webster) is a '<em>politician</em>' and that he will help you without doubt provided that he
      thinks that it will not interfere at all with him." According to the Washington
      Directory of 1864, Webster was not chief clerk but a clerk of the fourth class
      in the State Department.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00764_n4">4. Preston King
      (1806–1865) served as United States Senator from New York from 1857 to
      1863. On February 11, Walt Whitman called for the first time upon King, who did
      not "remember that Mr. Sumner had spoken to him about me. . . . King was blunt,
      decisive and manly . . . I think Sumner is a sort of gelding—no good." At the
      second interview on February 13, King gave Whitman "a letter to the Secretary of
      the Treasury [Chase]—also to Gen'l Meigs, chief of Quartermaster dep't." Whitman
      had an interview with Sumner on February 20 and asked him for "a boost" if he
      did not obtain a position by March 4. (This information is based upon jottings
      in one of Whitman's notebooks in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.)<a href="#r4">[back]

      letters to 
       and 
       from January 10,

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00764_n6">6. Montgomery C. Meigs
      (1816–1892) was appointed quartermaster general on May 14, 1861, and
      served in that capacity throughout the war. Bruce Catton (<em>Glory Road: The Bloody Route from Fredericksburg to Gettysburg</em> [Garden
      City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1952], 96) describes Meigs as "a grave and estimable man
      who deserves just a little better of posterity than he seems likely ever to
      get."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00764_n7">7. John Taylor's Saloon was
      located at 365 Broadway. Amos Bronson Alcott noted in his journal on December
      12, 1856, that he dined there with Whitman, "discussing America, its men and
      institutions" (<em>The Journals of Bronson Alcott</em>, ed. Odell
      Shepard [Boston: Little, Brown and Company,1938], 293).<a href="#r7">[back]
