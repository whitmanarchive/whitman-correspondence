   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00197_n1">1. On January 26, 1879,
      the <em>Philadelphia Times</em> published Whitman's article
      "Winter Sunshine. A Trip from Camden to the Coast." The pun on the title in this
      brief note would seem to indicate that this is the lost letter Whitman wrote to
      Ritter noted in his <em>Daybooks and Notebooks</em>, ed. William
      White (New York: New York University Press, 1978) for February 24, 1879, and
      that he enclosed a copy of the article.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="upa.00197_n2">2. Frederic Louis Ritter,
      composer and professor at Vassar College, who set Whitman's "Two Veterans" to
      music in 1880.<a href="#r2">[back]
