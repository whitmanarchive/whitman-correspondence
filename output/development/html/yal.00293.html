      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>In New York on Thursday I saw Marvin and was glad to hear from you through him.—He
      said
      you had not seen the Nation review of Dr 
      Buckes
      
       book and had expressed a desire to do so. So having a copy I cut it out and
      enclose it. You will see it makes some outrageously false statements about you
      at which your friends were naturally indignant, but I am surprised that William
      was green enough to suppose that he could get any reply printed in that organ of
      the Philistines; and he probably made it so severe as to preclude its
      publication 
      any way even supposing them to
      have been suddenly smitten with a conscience. A very improbable
      supposition.—
   </p>
   
   <p>You have heard that I have finally received the "grand bounce" from an ungrateful
      government. The fact is I have been rather badly treated by an uncircumsized dog
      from Kentucky, but such a thing was bound to happen sooner or later, and better
      now than later.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am still in the prime of life, have health, some means and many friends, and if
      under these circumstances I did not cheerfully accept the situation I should be
      unworthy ever to have read Leaves of Grass, with its philosophy of hope and the
      morning.—
   </p>
   
   <p>I enclose you my professional card. If
      after a fair trial I do not succeed in earning a living  in this way I shall probably
      drift back into my old trade of Publishing.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you are as comfortable as usual, and enjoying as much of life as you
      describe in some of the later notes in Specimen Days.—
   </p>
   
   <p>I should be delighted to hear from you, and believe me ever</p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Faithfully Yours
      <br></br>Charley.
