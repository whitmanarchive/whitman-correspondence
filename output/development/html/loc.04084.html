   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04084_n1">1. This letter was marked
      Sunday, which would fit 1878; however, Whitman sent a kit of fish November 24,
      1877, so the date may be 1877.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0817">2. Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).<a href="#r2">[back]
