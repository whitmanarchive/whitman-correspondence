   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07718_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. |
      Oct 27 | 5 PM | 89; Philadelphia, PA | Oct | 27 | 7PM | 1889 | Transit; Buffalo, N.Y.

   <p id="loc.07718_n2">2. An almost identical entry
      appeared in Whitman's Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) on this
      date. Whitman is referring to 
      "The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree" from the Bible, which is found in the book of
      Luke, Chapter 13, Verses 6–9, and the quote
      is from Verse 7.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07713_n2">3. On October 18, 1889,
      Whitman sent a cluster of poems entitled "Old Age's Echoes" to Henry Mills Alden
      of <em>Harper's New Monthly Magazine</em> and asked $100
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book [Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.]). On
      October 24, Alden rejected the work: "It is too much of an improvisation for our
      use. I had it set up, hoping that, seeing it in type, I might come to a more
      favorable impression of its form. The thought is worthy of a more careful
      texture in its parts &amp; of a more shapely embodiment as a whole. I am not
      critisizing. Criticism has no place in the poet's world. I am writing only as a
      Magazine editor with reference to Magazine requirements." Alden's letter cannot
      be located. On November 2, 1889, Whitman sent the piece, now called "Old Age
      Echoes," to <em>Nineteenth Century</em> and asked £20; the
      editor, James Knowles, returned the manuscript on . The "3 or 4 sonnets poemets," as the poet
      characterized the work in his Commonplace Book, were eventually published in the
      March 1891 issue of Lippincott's Magazine. Here, the
      poem "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00140.html">Old-Age Echoes</a>" consists of the "poemets" titled "Sounds of the
      Winter," "The Unexpress'd," "Sail out for Good, EidÓlon Yacht!" and "After
      the Argument." "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00139.html">To the Sun-Set Breeze</a>" appeared in <em>Lippincott's
         Monthly Magazine</em> in December, 1890; Whitman received $60
      (Commonplace Book).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n4146">6. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel (1856–1914), was
      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on his relationship with Whitman, see
      Thomas Biggs Harned, <em>Memoirs of Thomas B. Harned, Walt
         Whitman's Friend and Literary Executor</em>, ed. Peter Van Egmond (Hartford:
      Transcendental Books, 1972).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">7. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="n0231c">8. James T. Fields (1817–1881)
      succeeded James Russell Lowell as editor of the <em>Atlantic
         Monthly</em> in 1861 and held the position until 1871.<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="loc.07718_n5">9. <em>Yesterdays with Authors</em> by James T. Fields was published in 1872 by James R. Osgood and Company of Boston,

   <p id="n4137">11. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
