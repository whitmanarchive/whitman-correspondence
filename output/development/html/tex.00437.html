   <p>I am not afraid of the District Attorney's threat—it quite certainly could not
      amount to any thing—but I want you to be satisfied, to continue as publishers
      of the book (&amp; I had already thought favorably of some such brief
      cancellation.)
   </p>
   
   <p>Yes, under the circumstances I am willing to make a revision &amp; cancellation in
      the pages alluded to—wouldn't be more than half a dozen anyhow—perhaps
      indeed about ten lines to be left out, &amp; half a dozen words or phrases.<sup><a href="#upa.00201_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Have just returned from a fortnight down in the Jersey woods,<sup><a href="#upa.00201_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; find your letter—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00201_n1">1. According to Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, this communication was sent on March 8 (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00201_n2">2. On March 1, Oliver
      Stevens, District Attorney in Boston, wrote to Osgood &amp; Co.: "We are of the
      opinion that this book is such a book as brings it within the provisions of the
      Public Statutes respecting obscene literature and suggest the propriety of
      withdrawing the same from circulation and suppressing the editions thereof." In
      transmitting Stevens's letter to Whitman on , the firm asked Whitman's "consent to the withdrawal of the present
      edition and the substitution of an edition lacking the obnoxious
      features."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00201_n3">3. Whitman was with the
      Staffords from February 16 to March 6 (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r3">[back]
