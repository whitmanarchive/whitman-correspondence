      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours received last night<sup><a href="#loc.00465_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—We were all sorry to hear that you had had such a bad turn<sup><a href="#loc.00465_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—and glad enough to hear that you were gaining—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mattie is about the same as when I last wrote—she is not failing so badly now—last
      night she rested better—did not seem to have quite so much pain
   </p>
   
   <p>Still I do not think that she can be said to gain any—only she is not failing so fast
      and that is a great comfort—The last two days have been damp and cold and rainy so
      that makes it bad—I do hope dear Walt you will be able to come and see her—if [<em>sic</em>] would be a great comfort to her—
   </p>
   
   <p>She sends you love and so dear brother do I</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
