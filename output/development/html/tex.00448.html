   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Donaldson
      (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
      introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
      the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
      carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt
         Whitman, the Man</em> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see
      Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_111.html">Donaldson, Thomas (1843–1898)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="tex.00448_n2">2. Barrett, the actor (see
      the letter from Whitman to Harry Stafford of ), sent $10 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). On November 9 Whitman received through Donaldson "Ferry pass
      for horse &amp; buggy" (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00448_n3">3. On October 19,
      accompanied by Dr. William Osler, Whitman went to see Professor Norris "ab't my
      eyes . . . satisfactory visit &amp; examination—I had feared I was
      becoming blind. Dr N. decidedly discountenanced the idea" (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00448_n4">4. William Duckett was the
      driver. After he received the carriage Whitman visited his friends more
      frequently. On November 1 he noted his "5th visit" to the Staffords. He went to
      see Harry Stafford and his wife later in the month, and had Thanksgiving Day
      dinner with Debbie Browning on November 26 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). On
      either November 5 or 6 Sir Graham Balfour (1858–1929), the cousin and
      biographer of Robert Louis Stevenson, and Earl Russell, John Francis Stanley
      (1865–1931), a barrister and brother of Bertrand Russell (who was later to
      marry Alys Smith), called on Whitman. Russell contributed to the English
      offering; see William Michael Rossetti's letter of .<a href="#r4">[back]
