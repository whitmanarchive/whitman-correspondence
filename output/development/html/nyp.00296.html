      <br></br><br></br>Dear William O'Connor,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just rec'd your letter. To make the matter certain won't you take thirty or
      forty minutes &amp; go down to the St. Cloud—look at the rooms, &amp; pick out one for me?—positively
      engaging it—You know what is good as well as I do, (I mean for me)—I shall want a
      room at least for a few weeks—&amp; perhaps for the winter—&amp; for that season one is not
      so particular about the location—(But perhaps you have already engaged for me at St.
      C. a specific room.)
   </p>

      lovingly
      <br></br>Walt.<sup xmlns=""><a href="#nyp.00296_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>

   <p id="nyp.00296_n2">2. "Sigma" noted in the New
      York <em>Evening Mail</em> on October 27, 1870, the poet's return
      to Washington, "where Walt Whitman fitly belongs, both in his <em>personnel</em> and what his works represent." The correspondent also
      reported that Whitman now supported the French, liked and defended Grant, and
      placed "little stock in 'woman's rights.'"<a href="#r2">[back]
