   <p>We have recently purchased at the Auction Rooms of Messrs Geo. A. Leavitt Co
      of this city the electrotype plates of an edition of your "Leaves of Grass" bearing
      the imprint of Thayer
      and Eldridge, Boston 1860–61.<sup><a href="#n0801" id="r2">2</a></sup> As the edition is not complete although subject
      as I understand to a copyright of ten percent it seems to me that it would be better
      for all parties to have it completed. If this idea meets your views on the subject I would
      be willing to make you an immediate payment of $250.00 on account and will [
      <span class="unclear">do?</span>]
       everything in my power to make the book
      sell.<sup><a href="#yal.00312_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>

   <p>An early reply would oblige</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1053">1. Richard Worthington was a New York
      printer who published and sold unauthorized editions of Whitman's <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, printed from the plates of the 1860
      edition. Whitman explains his claims against Worthington in his , letter to Richard Watson Gilder.

      of California Press, 2000), 401, and Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
