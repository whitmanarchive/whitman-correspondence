      <br></br><br></br>Mr Walt Whitman
      <br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I want to get your new book (the "Two Rivulets" I think it is called) for a friend
      of
      mine on his next Birthday July 1st 1876. I asked for it
      at one of the largest book stores in this place but they did not have it, so I
      thought the best way would be to write to you. I would much prefer to send to you
      for it if you will be kind enough to send it please let me know the price. My friend
      is a great admirer of yours. him and I have lately been reading your "Leaves of
      Grass" and 
       "Drum Taps" and
      we are very much pleased with them. I admire and respect you very much for the way
      in which you write about Mr Abraham Lincoln, our Brave Soldiers, and the African
      race. I think Mr Lincoln was one of the best men that ever lived. our Soldiers we
      can not praise them 
      to
      
       much and the poor blacks needs the sympathy of every good man and woman on
      earth.
   </p>

   <p>P.S. This friend of mine that I write about wrote to you some time ago perhaps
      you remember him. his name is C. W. Hine. I know he would appreciate one of your
      Books better than anything else I could give him
