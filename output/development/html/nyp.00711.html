   <p>Yes Nelly the magazine came all straight—We all like the story—so much in
      the turn of it reminds me of William<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; the days that are
      gone—We are of course more whetted than ever to have the <u>full book</u> fr'm H M &amp; Co:—Is it yet in abeyance?—And you,
      &amp; how are you getting along? Nicely I hope.—H T<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r3">3</a></sup> is
      going over his L S books &amp; more &amp; more impress'd with the
      sketches—<sup><a href="#nyp.00711_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>I have had a bad winter &amp; have
      yet—grip, catarrh of bowels, bladder trouble &amp;c: &amp;c:—have not
      been outdoors for ten weeks—but sit up here &amp; read &amp; write much of the
      time—but fearful inertia &amp; loss of interest, grip, or zest—Have a
      good doctor &amp; take medicine daily—Am printing the little 2d annex,
      "Good-Bye my Fancy"—reading the proofs &amp; putting it through
      slowly—Should not get along with it or anything without Horace
      Traubel—comes every day, &amp; is invaluable—Dr B<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      is still the same in London Canada—I believe expects to come this way (&amp;
      to Washington) in three weeks—Fine sunny day as I write—had my breakfast
      a rare fried egg, Graham wet toast &amp; coffee—my supper at 5—no
      dinner—pretty fair spirits—often think of you there &amp; the former
      times—Write when you can.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
