   <p>Have finished my Germantown visit &amp; am back here. I did not send Dr B[ucke]'s
      book to Mrs. Ritter<sup><a href="#nyp.00496_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—have indeed not sent copies to
      any except my sisters and 
      neices.<sup><a href="#nyp.00496_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Mrs. Gilchrist, however, has a
      copy—John Burroughs also has—Glad you sent one to Tucker<sup><a href="#nyp.00496_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—he is a good friend—I have not heard any
      thing more of Rolleston's German translation.<sup><a href="#nyp.00496_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Dr Karl
      Knortz, cor: Morris av. &amp; 155th st. New York City, has translated many of my
      poems in German, &amp; published them.<sup><a href="#nyp.00496_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Do you know the
      <em>Nation</em> is made up of <em>Evening Post</em>
      matter?

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00496_n1">1. This letter is
      incorrectly endorsed (by O'Connor): "Answ'd Sept 4/82." It is addressed: Wm D
      O'Connor | Life Saving Service | Treasury | Washington D C. It is postmarked:
      Philadelphia | Pa. | Aug 29 83 | 6 30 PM; Washington, Recd. | Aug | 30 | 4 30 AM
      | 1883 | 2.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00496_n3">3. Whitman was not accurate.
      He sent Bucke's book to John H. Johnston and to John Swinton on July 19
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00496_n4">4. Benjamin R. Tucker was a
      translator and friend of Ruskin as well as an editor. On , Tucker offered to act as Whitman's publisher in order
      to test the Boston banning of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1992], 9
      vols., 2:253–254). As editor of <em>Liberty</em>, he
      followed the Boston controversy closely in editorial comments on May 27, June
      10, and July 22. In the July issue he printed an advertisement in which he
      offered to sell and mail <em>Leaves of Grass</em> to any
      purchaser, and informed Stevens, Marston, Tobey, and Comstock, all of whom were
      mentioned by name, that he was willing to have his offer tested in the courts.
      On August 19 he commented: "We have offered to meet the enemy, but the enemy
      declines to be met. . . . We still advertise the book for sale, and sell it
      openly and rapidly." The advertisement appeared again on September 16. For more
      information on the controversy, see Joseph P. Hammond, "Stevens, Oliver (b.
      1825)" and "Comstock, Anthony (1844–1919)," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00496_n5">5. On  and again on  Rolleston discussed problems connected with his
      translation (Traubel, 4:111–112). On October 14 Whitman sent Knortz's
      translations to Rolleston, and on December 10 noted receipt of his friend's
      "lecture pamphlet, 'Wordsworth and Walt Whitman' from Dresden [<em>Über Wordsworth und Walt Whitman</em>]" (Whitman's Commonplace Book).
      A translation of Rolleston's lecture, prepared by Horace Traubel's father and
      corrected by Whitman, appeared in the Camden <em>Daily Post</em>
      on February 13, 1884. Whitman's corrections in purple crayon appear in Traubel's
      manuscript in the Feinberg Collection.<a href="#r5">[back]
