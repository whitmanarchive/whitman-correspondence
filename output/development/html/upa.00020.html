   <p>Thanks my dear friend for your hospitable &amp; affectionate letter, &amp; invitations. I
      too want to come &amp; see you all, &amp; be with you from time to time—hoping it may be good
      &amp; a comfort to all of us—to <u>me</u> surely—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—As (though better this winter) decidedly sensitive to the cold—how would it do for
      me to have a little sheet-iron 
      wood stove, &amp; some wood sawed &amp; cut, &amp; carried up in the south room, immediately adjoining
      the one I before occupied?—Could it be done?—Is there a hole
      
      
      in the chimney in that room—or place for stove pipe?—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I am getting along quite well—&amp; shall be over very soon—possibly Thursday—</p>

   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>(A pretty good fire—&amp; a wood fire—is to me I find the greatest physical comfort I
      can have 
      this weather—I should want to select &amp; purchase, &amp; have put up myself, the stove,
      wood, &amp;c.)

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00020_n1">1. Because this letter is
      among the other Gilchrist correspondence, formerly in the possession of Mrs.
      Frank J. Sprague, there can be no doubt that it was addressed to Anne Gilchrist.
      Since the Gilchrists were in Philadelphia in December 1876, and since Whitman
      accompanied Eldridge to the Gilchrists' on December 12, 1877 (see the letters
      from Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist of  and to Beatrice Gilchrist of ), this letter was written in 1876.<a href="#r1">[back]
