   <p>Mother, I will write only a short letter this time, as I have a good deal of work
      to do
      to-day in the office. Every thing goes on with me just the same as usual—I hope you
      are feeling well, dear mother, &amp; the rest too.<sup><a href="#duk.00665_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
