   <p>Recd Camden paper with [

         Schells?</span>]
       notice of the Good Gray Poet: pleased Han very much: I
      consider it photographic and highly entertaining: handed it to the local edr of "Free Press": was
      republished a couple days ago, and by this time has been circulated and read
      throughout the entire state.
   </p>
   
   <p>Bought Han the chair, large, wallnut frame, well, handsomely upholstered: commodious
      with head rest: is very comfortable, at 9 dollars cash, new from store. Hard  times:
      Distributed paintings: 7, framed—65 dollars—some discounts—Realized 137 dollars—paid
      out for new stove etc, coal, groceries, installment on
      slate roof—painters, butcher etc—$149.00—
   </p>
   
   <p>Hard winter: 20 below zero, two nights ago—freezing without intermission—lake a white
      plane 10 miles across. Avalanches of snow slipping from the
      slates, crushing, thundering, covering all near or below it—
   </p>
   
   <p>1st of May the steamer is due on the lake—must change soon—yet
      holds on grimly—Han sends her love to you—allways Walt; Walt is so good—Han
      remembers Brooklyn and younger days: a great change—she will get well.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a French-born
      landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman (1823–1890), Walt
      Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_96.html">Heyde, Charles Louis (1822–1892)</a>," <em>Walt
