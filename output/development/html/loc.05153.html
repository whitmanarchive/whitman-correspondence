      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Long &amp; long does it seem since I have had any word or sign from you. I hope all
      goes well &amp; that you have had a pleasant, refreshing summer trip somewhere. All
      goes on much as usual with us.

   <p><em>Hythe. Kent. 
         Oct.
         
          21.</em> Not having felt very well the last month or two, and Giddy
      also seeming to need a little bracing up, we came down to this ancient town by the
      sea—one of the Cinque Ports—on Wednesday, and much we like it—a
      fine open sea—a delicious "briny odour"—and inland much that is curious
      and interesting—for this part of the Kentish Coast—so near to
      France—has innumerable old castles, forts, moats, traces everywhere of
      centuries of warfare and of means of defence against our great neighbour. It is a
      fine hilly, woody country, too, and very picturesque these grey massive ruins, many
      of them used now as farm houses, look. The men of Kent are very proud of their
      country and are reckoned a fine race—tall, muscular, ruddy-complexioned,
      and often too with thick, tawny-red beards—curious how in our little
      island the differences of race-stock are still so discernible—keep along
      this same coast to the west only about a couple of hundred miles &amp; you come to
      such a different type—dark—blackest and Cornish men.—I get a nice
      letter now &amp; then from John Burroughs. I also saw this summer two women doctors
      who were very kind &amp; good friends to my darling Bee—Drs.
      
       Pope—twin sisters from Boston, whom it did me good to see. They work
      hard—have a good practice—&amp; say they don't know what a day's illness
      means so far as they themselves are concerned. They tell me also that the women
      doctors are doing capital work in America—and that one of them, who was with
      dear Beatrice at the 
      Penn. Med. Col., Dr. Alice Bennett, is the efficient head of the woman's department of a
      large lunatic asylum. We are getting on in England too—but the field where
      English women doctors find the most work &amp; the best position is India, where as
      the women are not allowed by their male relatives to be attended by men, the
      mortality was immense.—Herby has taken a better studio than our house
      afforded—both as to light &amp; size—&amp; finds the advantage great. I
      expect he is having a delightful walk this brilliant morning with the "Hampstead
      Tramps"—of whom I think I have told you. They often walk fifteen miles or so on
      Sunday morning.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Such a glorious afternoon it has been by the sea—sapphire colour—the air
      brisk &amp; elastic, yet soft. To-morrow Grace goes home &amp; I shall be all
      alone here.—I hear of "Specimen Days" in a letter from Australia—there
      will be a large audience for you there some day, dear Friend. I like what John
      Burroughs has been writing about Carlyle much. We have had nothing but stupidities
      of late about him here—but there will come a great reaction from all this
      abuse, I have no doubt—he did put so much gall in his ink sometimes, human
      nature can't be expected to take it altogether meekly. I hope you received my little
      book safely. I should be a hypocrite if I pretended not to care whether you found
      patience to read it—for I grew to love Mary &amp; Charles Lamb so much during
      my task that I want you to love them too—&amp; to see what a beautiful
      friendship was theirs with Coleridge.

   <p>How are Mr. &amp; Mrs. Whitman and Hattie &amp; Jessie? Send me a few words
      soon.
