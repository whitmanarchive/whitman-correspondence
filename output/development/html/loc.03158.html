      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> This is a fine Xmas morning—cold &amp; clear—the air full of church
      bells chiming. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p> You should see my old mother—[
      <span class="unclear">spry?</span>]
       today, gets about without a stick, not bowed, nor over
      much wrinkled; full of fun and clear headed &amp; able to direct the turkey-stuffing
      and suet-pudding making as well as ever. She has kept her mentality (as the
      spiritists used to say) as sound &amp; bright as ever it was. And her memory is
      remarkable. She calls up the forgotten past and tells us all of our deeds &amp;
      misdeeds. You bet she was awfully tickled to see me—I found them all  abed, &amp; had
      to [
      <span class="unclear">ring?</span>]
       them up. They
      all came down, my brothers, sister, &amp; the three children, &amp; didn't get back
      to bed again till past one o clock. They also have a capacious tea pot, &amp; it was
      well filled. I gave mother your compliments &amp; she sends her kindest to you,
      &amp; hopes you will take a [
      <span class="unclear">start?</span>]
       someday as she did &amp; walk without cane. She was delighted
      with the cake the Harned's sent, &amp; with Mrs Davis'<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      silk kerchief. She said the "angel food was sadly needed" in her family. And then
      you should hear her laugh.  She said she used to say when she was a girl, she hoped she
      should never get so polite she couldn't laugh, &amp; she believes laughing has kept
      her alive. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I find my brother a very democratic individual—rather opinionated &amp; too
      "damn sure" to get on easy with; but he allows two black fellows to sleep in his
      shop &amp; ekes out their scanty subsistence with a cup of coffee &amp; a "bite,"
      &amp; at Christmas dinner he had up an old lady who lives alone, a sort of
      counterpart to Aunt Mary. She thought she must do something, so she brought up a
      "poor man's pudding"  and we had the toughest job to get away with it, so as not to
      disturb her. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I am in the midst of the confusion—all the family around &amp; talking, &amp;
      the cold weather—I wonder if it's so in Camden. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I just write this <u>memoranda</u> to let you know the situation.
      Perhaps Mrs Davis will care to read it, &amp; accept the old lady's proud thanks.
      The first my brother said when I showed him the Hicks picture<sup><a href="#loc.03158_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> was—"He's the man who said the blood of Christ has
      no more to do with our sins" &amp;c. He thinks it a grand head. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Send me a few words if no more. Hope the day has been a merry one for you all. </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03158_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle St | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked: RICHMOND
      IND | JAN 31 | 830PM | 88; CAMDEN. N.J. | FEB | 2 | [illegible].<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n6113">2. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_92.html">Davis, Mary Oakes (1837 or 1838–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03158_n2">3. Whitman also liked the
      portrait of the quaker preacher Elias Hicks (by Henry Inman) that he included in
      <em>November Boughs</em>. To Horace Traubel he later said: "I
      can see defects; this forehead, for instance, is not quite as it should be; but
      my general notion of the portrait is a good one: as I often say, I congratulate
      myself that it's not so damned bad as it might be" (<em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.56.html">Saturday, September 8th, 1888</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
