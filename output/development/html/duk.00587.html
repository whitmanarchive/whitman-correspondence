   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00587_n8">1. This letter dates to
      December 22, 1869. The date December 22 is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand,
      and Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1869. Edwin Haviland Miller accepted
      Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). The year 1869 is correct
      because it is consistent with a December rumor that William Strong would be
      appointed to the office of attorney general.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00587_n4">2. The word may be "easy"
      written over "easier," but the more probable reading is that the letters "ier"
      are written over the letter "y."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00587_n9">4. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      probably refers to a brief article that identifies William Strong as President
      Ulysses S. Grant's potential appointment to office of attorney general ("The
      News," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, December 18, 1869, 2).
      Louisa's interest is that Walt Whitman served as a clerk in the office of the
      attorney general. William Strong (1808–1895) was never nominated to office
      of attorney general, but Grant eventually nominated him to the Supreme Court, in
      which he served as a justice from 1871 to 1880 (Lisabeth G. Svendsgaard,
      "Strong, William," <em>American National Biography Online</em>).
      Ebenezer R. Hoar (1816–1895) remained in the office until his resignation
      on June 23, 1870. Amos T. Ackerman (1821–1880) replaced Hoar (see Mark
      Grossman, <em>Encyclopedia of the United States Cabinet</em>
      [Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2000], 1:81–82).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00480_n9">5. William Conant Church
      (1836–1917) and his brother Francis Pharcellus Church (1839–1906)
      established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. For a time, the Churches
      considered Walt Whitman a regular contributor, printing several of his poems,
      including "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00192.html">A Carol of Harvest for 1867</a>," "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00027.html">Brother of All, With Generous Hand</a>," "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00022.html">Warble for Lilac-Time</a>," and "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00008.html">O Star of France</a>." For more on Whitman's relationship with the <em>Galaxy</em>, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_titles/per.00102.html">Whitman's Poems in Periodicals—The Galaxy</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00587_n5">6. Elijah Bruce (b. 1808) and
      Ruth Bruce (b. 1812) were the parents of Grace Haight (b. 1839), and they were
      neighbors near Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's residence at 71 Portland Avenue (see
      <em>United States Census, 1880</em>, New York, Brooklyn,
      Kings; and see Helen Price's October 13, 1872 letter to Louisa, Trent
      Collection, Duke University). Grace Haight's familiar and chatty  letter to Louisa in Camden, New
      Jersey, suggests they were quite close friends (Feinberg Collection, Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00480_n8">7. John Burroughs
      (1837–1921) met Walt Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864.
      After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a
      lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs wrote several books involving
      or devoted to Whitman's work: <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</em> (1867), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting
         the Universe</em> (1924). Ursula North (1836–1917) married John
      Burroughs in 1857 and also became a friend to Walt Whitman. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the Burroughs family, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John (1837–1921) and Ursula
         (1836–1917)</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00585_n2">8. William D. O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was one of Walt Whitman's staunchest defenders, and Walt was
      also close with William's wife Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor. Whitman dined with the
      O'Connors frequently during his Washington years, and he wrote often in his
      letters of their daughter Jean "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William
      O'Connor would break in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to
      emancipated black citizens, Ellen remained friendly with Whitman. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
