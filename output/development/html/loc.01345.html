      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mary Smith
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your second letter (dated July 9) came an hour ago—welcomed, &amp; read twice
      already—the acc't of the Toynbee?<sup><a href="#loc.01345_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Hall doings
      &amp; chat deeply interesting to me—I think much of all genuine efforts of the
      human emotions, the soul &amp; bodily &amp; intellectual powers, to exploit
      themselves for humanity's good—the <u>efforts in
         themselves</u>, I mean (sometimes I am not sure but <u>they</u> are the main matter)—without stopping to calculate whether the
      investment is tip-top in a business or statistical point of view. These libations,
      ecstatic life-pourings as it were of precious wine or <u>rose</u>-<u>water</u> on vast desert sands or great polluted river—taking
      chances for returns <u>or</u>
      <u>no</u>
      <u>returns</u>—what were they (or are they) but the theory
      &amp; practice of the beautiful God Christ? or of all divine personality?
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>We have had a week of furious hot weather here—&amp; are having it
      yet—(seems to have concentrated in &amp; around Philadelphia)—I keep
      pretty well, considering—dont go out at all till toward sundown, but get on
      the river two or three hours afterwards every even'g—I send in Phil. Press my
      last little piece<sup><a href="#loc.01345_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—you must chew upon it a
      little—my inward idea in it being the least literary or <u>poetical</u>, &amp; most physiological &amp; scientific—
   </p>
   
   <p>My last letter from Dr. Bucke spoke of his going off with a sick friend &amp;
      relative to the Canadian Rockies, a jaunt of six or seven weeks—I have heard
      lately from John Burroughs—he has been writing quite a piece ab't Matthew
      Arnold, which I tho't at first I w'd send you, but I believe I won't—as it is
      not very clear or encouraging—rather <u>dis</u>couraging<sup><a href="#loc.01345_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Ab't myself &amp; my own affairs there is nothing new or special to write, Mary dear.
      My house-lady Mrs. Davis continues to be in every respect (handiwork &amp;
      atmosphere) the very best and most acceptable that could have befallen me—Hot
      as it is, &amp; with several kind invitations away, I remain for the summer at my
      shanty in Mickle Street—upon the whole it is best for me—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mary, I hope your next letter will tell me of a visit to Mrs. Gilchrist—As I
      close it suggests itself to me that I prepare one of the big photos (the one with
      hand up to mouth) &amp; send you to give to the Toynbee? Hall folk—Love to you
      &amp; all

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.01345_n2">2. Whitman's question mark
      (placed above "Toynbee" here and again at the end of the letter). On September 6
      he sent "photos &amp;c" to the Rev. S. A. Barnett, of London, "for Toynbee Hall"
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book). This settlement house was established by young
      Oxford fellows and named for Arnold Toynbee, a friend of Mary Smith's future
      husband. It was described in a letter from Eldridge to O'Connor on August 10:
      "It is a sort of priesthood, but of course the vows are self imposed—Walt
      is their great exemplar and teacher and they speak of him reverently as <em>Master</em>" (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York
      Public Library). See also R. A. Parker, <em>The Transatlantic
         Smiths</em> (1959), 59.<a href="#r2">[back]
