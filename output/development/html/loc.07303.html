   <p>Pretty warm here. Wonderful growing weather. Wish you could see the Asylum grounds
      and gardens, they look well. I got the papers about the <u>dinner</u><sup><a href="#loc.03027_n4" id="r1">1</a></sup> and about you calling
      in your chair at the "Post" office.<sup><a href="#loc.07303_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> I am real glad to think that you are out and
      getting a little fresh air and sunshine. All quiet here—no end of work and not
      much of any thing else. No word from Willy Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r3">3</a></sup> for about two weeks—don't know
      whether the meter has come to grief or what is wrong—probably he is busy &amp;
      is simply putting off writing. I suppose the good Camden folk are fully committed
      to
      the dinner now.<sup><a href="#loc.07303_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> I hope they will make it a grand success. I wish I
      could be there but it will be impossible. We have an Annual Ball on 30<u>th</u> and if
      nothing else stood in the way the Ball would prevent me leaving. I am going to
      Delaware for a drive tomorrow—the country is as lovely as it can be I expect a
      good time—will tell you Monday how I got on.<sup><a href="#loc.07303_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03027_n4">1. For Whitman's seventieth
      birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
      the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
      (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.30.html">Tuesday, May 7, 1889</a>. The day was celebrated with a testimonial
      dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
      addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
      arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07303_n3">2. Whitman had recently gotten a wheel chair that gave him access to the 
      outdoors again, and he occasionally stopped in to the Camden <em>Post</em> offices to see friends there.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4284">3. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors." For additional information, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.56.html">Sunday, March 17, 1889</a>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.57.html">Monday, March 18, 1889</a>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.61.html"> Friday, March 22, 1889</a>, and <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.73.html">Wednesday, April 3, 1889.</a>

   <p id="loc.07303_n1">4. Notices for Whitman's birthday dinner were published
      on May 10, 1889, in both the Camden <em>Post</em> and the Camden
      <em>Courier</em> (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.33.html">Friday, May 10, 1889</a>).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07303_n2">5. The list of names
      that has been added below Bucke's signature in an unidentified hand, is almost certainly
      associated with the poet's birthday dinner; some of them were part of the planning
      committee for 
      the event, while others would serve as speakers. Artem Lozynsky theorizes that "the
      list represents the names of those to whom Whitman intended
      to present copies of the 1889 edition of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>—the 'Birthday Book'" since Traubel suggested this idea to Whitman, who seemed to
      be in favor of the plan (<em>The Letters of Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke to 
         Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Artem Loyzynsky [Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1977], 127n2.
      Traubel writes, "I proposed that he [Whitman] give copies of the Birthday Book to
      the main speakers, and he instantly took hold of
      the idea. 'Yes—that would mean Clifford, Tom, Herbert, Frank Williams,
      perhaps the Colonel—who else?'" (<em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.47.html">Friday, May 24, 1889</a>).
