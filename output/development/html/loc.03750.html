   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Matlock Scovel began to
      practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War he was in the New Jersey
      legislature, and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned actively for Horace
      Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S. Treasury during Chester
      Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home
      for Sunday breakfast, as he did on December 2 and 9, 1877 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a description of
      these breakfasts, see <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed.
      William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel,
      see George R. Prowell's <em>The History of Camden County, New
         Jersey</em> (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886).

   <p id="n4146">2. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer

      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
