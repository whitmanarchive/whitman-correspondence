      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have lately been spending happy days with my dear friend, Rev Samuel
      Longfellow,<sup><a href="#loc.02051_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> beneath the shadow of the Old Man of the
      Mountain in the Franconia Notch. Returning home I found
      on my table the papers and pamphlet, and photogravure photograph of yourself, which
      you sent to me. The 
       portrait hangs
      now on my wall in my little book-lined den at Waltham, where I may see it whenever
      I
      raise my eyes from my work. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish to thank you in the warmest terms for your very considerable and much
      appreciated gift. Never before, believe me, have I experienced anything that pleased
      
       me more. And the
      picture especially and O'Connor's pamphlet I shall always cherish as most precious
      expressions of regard from one whom I honor before all other writers of our land.
      To
      have written anything that could please you is a satisfaction which I highly prize.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I had a letter a week ago from a Spaniard in Avila, Spain. This, which he said, you
      will be glad to hear: "Kant, Lucretius, Swinburne<sup><a href="#n0610" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
      , Musset,<sup><a href="#loc.02051_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Goethe, &amp; Walt Whitman make up my library." 
   </p>
   
   <p>When is the new volume of poems to come to us? </p>
   
   <p>With profound gratitude for your especial notice of my faulty work, and a deep sense
      of obligation for the intellectual stimulus that your poems have given to me, I am
      
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Morton Fullerton
      (1865–1952) was an American journalist and is perhaps remembered mostly
      for his affair with author Edith Wharton (a fellow admirer of Whitman) in the
      early 20th century.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02051_n2">1. Samuel Longfellow
      (1819–1892) was Unitarian pastor and transcendentalist from New England.
      He was well-known for composing hymns.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0610">2. Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) was a
      British poet, critic, playwright, and novelist. He was also one of Whitman's
      earliest English admirers. At the conclusion of <em>William Blake:
         A Critical Essay</em> (1868), 300–303, Swinburne pointed out
      similarities between Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly
      Rocking" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the
      most sweet and sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world." His
      famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America" is included in <em>Songs
         before Sunrise</em> (1871). For the story of Swinburne's veneration of
      Whitman and his later recantation, see two essays by Terry L. Meyers, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00740.pdf">Swinburne and Whitman: Further Evidence</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 14 (Summer 1996), 1–11 and "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00902.pdf">A
         Note on Swinburne and Whitman</a>," <em>WWQR</em> 21 (Summer
      2003), 38–39.<a href="#r2">[back]
