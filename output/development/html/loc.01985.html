   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman stayed with Dr. George
      A. White, a chiropodist, and his wife Isabella A. White from March 1, 1871,
      until Whitman left Washington. Whitman had paid $236 in rent through June
      10, 1873 (The Library of Congress #73). On November 28, 1873, Dr. acknowledged
      for his wife receipt of $28 "on account . . . for rent of room etc from May
      1st/73" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). Walt Whitman gave up one room at the
      Whites' on June 10, 1873: "Kept the other at $2.50 a month" (The Library of
      Congress #68). According to a letter dated , Isabella White had written, evidently early in July, about the
      rent due for his room; Whitman's reply is not extant. On the 29th, White offered
      to purchase Walt Whitman's bedstead and certain other effects. Walt Whitman had
      not settled his account when White wrote again on , and offered him a credit of $10 for his
      furnishings against a balance of $38. These letters are in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection.(See also Walt Whitman's , letter to Peter Doyle, in which Whitman left instructions for
      the delivery of his boxes from the Whites.)
