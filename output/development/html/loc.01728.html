      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman
      
   </p>
    
   
   
   <p>I thank you heartily for my share in your Custer poem, which I have just read. It
      is splendidly strong and sustained and full of a noble motive. I am especially glad
      to learn, in such an authoritative way, of your health and vigor.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish you would
      
      
      take the trouble to let me know when your volume of collected works is to be published
      and where I can subscribe for it. I have heard that it was to be published by subscription,
      but have not heard any further details.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My address is now 506 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio, and I would be
      
      
      very much obliged if you would spend a moment in letting me know how to get an early
      copy of the book for which many are looking.
   </p>

      Yours faithfully

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Hay (1838–1905) was Abraham
      Lincoln's private secretary and a historian as well as Secretary of State under
      Theodore Roosevelt. Hay praised Whitman's "A Death-Sonnet for Custer" (later
      entitled "From Far Dakota's Cañons") when it appeared in the New York <em>Daily Tribune</em> on July 10, 1876. Whitman sent the 1876
      Centennial Edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> to Hay on August 1,
      1876 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
