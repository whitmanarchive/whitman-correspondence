   <p>In London last [
      <span class="unclear">month?</span>]
       I met many mutual friends who were asking after you and wondering when you would
      come over to the "Great Smoky Capital" friends who know you only by your books.  Last
      [
      <span class="unclear">winter?</span>]
       Story of Rome, the author of "Cleopatra" you remember, asked me for your photo, [
      <span class="unclear">and?</span>]
       I gave it him to contemplate and he has it yet: Are you coming, and when? [
      <span class="unclear">Most like?</span>]
       I shall  
      
      
      
      
      return to the States this winter and then visit Washington for I have [

       yet seen our [
      <span class="unclear">national?</span>]
       Capitol.
   </p>
   
   <p>The news of the great democratic vistas has first reached us and all Paris—that in
      all American Paris—is teribly excited: Of course this suits me, [
      <span class="unclear">born democrat?</span>]
       as I am, but I [
      <span class="unclear">trust?</span>]
       it will not at all disturb the [

       of [

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Joaquin Miller was the pen name of Cincinnatus Heine
      Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of the Rockies" and
      "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <em>Westminster Review</em>
      described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness which marked Walt Whitman's
      poetry." In an entry in his journal dated August 1, 1871, John Burroughs
      recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's poetry; see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin Co., 1931), 60. Whitman met Miller for the first time later in 1872; he
      wrote of a visit with Miller in a 
      letter to Charles W. Eldridge.
