   <p>I have been holding yr card<sup><a href="#loc.03009_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> announcing the death of W<u>m</u>
      D. O'C<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> in my hand at arm's length for several minutes
      trying to realize its import. Death always comes as a shock &amp; surprise. But a
      man with so intense a hold on life—so <u>alive</u> in
      every atom of him—well—I draw a long sigh, and like you I suppose,
      gather what is left of me together in resignation—reluctant acquiesence in
      the order of the universe.
   </p>
   
   <p>My regret is keen that I did not meet our noble &amp; brilliant friend.</p>
   
   <p>I hope that you will not succumb to this blow, but feel that the rest of yr
      friends are at yr side. How can we really believe in death? It is in yr
      writings, &amp; there alone that <u>I</u> have found the deepest
      glimpses into death-realm. You have made it life-realm to me—given me an
      idea of it grand in mystic possibilities.

   <p>So glad to hear of the out-door chair. I mark an item in Transcript abt

      Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r3">3</a></sup> may attend the funeral? Dear, dear, can

   <p>What I wrote last night perhaps had better not have been written. In yr deep
      grief silence wd have been better. I wish you know the depth of my own feeling
      the tumultuous emotional depths—sort of despair—stirred up always by
      death. And I wish I cd. make you feel how all day I have grieved &amp;
      meditated.
   </p> 
   
   <p>As you cannot go out, let me try to give you a <u>picture</u>
      as setting for this day's solemn (Sunday) meditation (with me) on the sacred
      theme of comrades life &amp; death. My days are passed in the harrowing uproar of a
      great printing estab. &amp; it is hard for me to find a soul-hour.
   </p>
   
   <p>I rose early, went down into the little parlor—neat as wax—&amp; looked
      over our dead friend's "Hamlet's Note-Book,"<sup><a href="#loc.03009_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> and especially a long six page
      brilliant letter fr. him to me anent the Shaksp. controversy, the Elizabethan Age
      &amp;c.
      How I prize that letter now!
   </p>
   
   <p>The dew had formed thick as rain in the night, &amp; I went out (the sweetest apple-blossom day of the year,—day) &amp; absorbed the
      scene, the freshness, the idyllic quiet—not a sound anywhere—soft
      warm mist hanging over [
      <span class="unclear">Boston?</span>]
       &amp; Strawberry Hill, the latter covered with apple trees in
      bloom. Three or four golden robins were clipping about thro' the air, singing &amp;
      chirping. Presently over in the pines a brown thrush struck up. Nature—the
      apparition—seemed so strong &amp; fair: was not W.m D. O'C dead—if one rightly regarded it—just as much in
      harmony with 
      the scene as my
      part of the life-throbbing whole?
      "What is good for the whole of nature is good also for a part"
   </p>
   
   <p>Then I went down thro' the fresh woods &amp; fields, fairly sheeted with blue
      violets &amp; yellow-gleaming butter-cups, with here &amp; there a fragile columbine pouring
      out
      its [
      <span class="unclear">horns?</span>]
       of
      perfume into the air. I usually refrain fr. picking wild-flowers; but in pensive
      mood I this time plucked a large handful of the largest &amp;
      deepest-colored—as for the hearse of our dear friend—to waft their
      incense to his soul now merged in the dark Unconscious, resolved back into
      silence and dream.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad he is at rest fr. his suffering, if it was to be.</p>
   
   <p>Can I be of any service here to Mrs O'C.<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r5">5</a></sup>?
   </p>
   
   <p>I feel well that I know but a small fraction of the friendship &amp; long years of
      devotion bet. you &amp; him.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0129">3. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03009_n2">4. O'Connor published <em>Hamlet's Note-Book</em>, subtitled "A defense of Mrs. Henry
      Pott" (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin [1886]). O'Connor here refers to Constance Mary
      Fearon Pott (1833–1914), who started the Francis Bacon Society and, after
      comparing figures of speech in Bacon to Shakespeare, argued for Bacon as the
      author behind Shakespeare's famous plays.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">5. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
