   <p>I have been down stairs, &amp; out on the street this afternoon—it is such fine
      weather, (after the bad storm of yesterday)—I got along very slowly, &amp; didn't go
      far—but it was a great thing after being kept in for over three weeks—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd a short letter from Jeff<sup><a href="#n0710" id="r2">2</a></sup> again to-day, dated 13th<sup><a href="#yal.00412_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>—nothing different with Mat<sup><a href="#n0707" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I rec'd your letter Saturday—I hope now to
      improve in walking—&amp; then I shall begin to feel all right—(but am still very
      feeble &amp; slow)—Peter Doyle &amp; another friend accompanied me out—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear Mother, I hope this will find you feeling well—Love to all—</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0710">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890), known as
      "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
      eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
      recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
      marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
      correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
      together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Matty) in 1873 and
      his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
      his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!" For
      more on Thomas Jefferson Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="yal.00412_n1">3. Jeff's letter to Walt Whitman is not
      extant, but on the same day he wrote to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman: Martha "is
      cheerful and brave—nothing can make her despondent in the shape of
      personal suffering—and I do not allow her to suffer from any feeling that
      we feel mournful or despondent" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0707">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman (d. 1873) known as "Mattie,"
      was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and
      Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
      the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat
      ailment that would lead to her death in 1873.<a href="#r4">[back]
