   <p>Scovel's<sup><a href="#n1049" id="r5">5</a></sup> long "Talk with Whitman"<sup><a href="#loc.07358_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> is about as little like W. as
      could well be—Guess we must stand it. There mis-representations will all be
      set right by and by. The real W.W. will undoubtedly emerge at last and be known of
      all men. Scovel's cussedness is damnable because he evidently means so well and does
      so badly. With (apparently) the best intention in the world, and thinking all the
      time that he is doing a big thing, he paints you as a 3d or 4th rate man all from
      pure inability to appreciate either W.W. or the quality of his (Scovel's) writing.
      But these little skits are <u>nothing</u>. The <u>real Whitman</u> will duly appear to the next and all
      following generations—do not be the least uneasy
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>about that. Sorry to hear of even partial return of grip—hope it will not stay
      long with you.

   <p>All well and going well here. Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r7">7</a></sup> working away at meter,
      expects to have same on the market with a few weeks. We have had some aggravating
      delays. A machine of ours stuck fast somewhere down the Hudson—been stuck the
      last 3 weeks &amp; still no word of it.—on account of strike I guess. So

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n3039">3. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="loc.07358_n3">4. In his letter of , Whitman mentions enclosing William
      Sloane Kennedy's  letter and "the printed
      slip" of James M. Scovel's "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00605.html">A Talk with Whitman</a>," which appeared in the 25 August 1890 issue of
      the Philadelphia <em>Times</em>. The slip from <em>The Inquirer</em> is unexplained. It may simply have been a reprint of the
      same Scovel "talk."<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n1049">5. James Matlock Scovel began to
      practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War he was in the New Jersey
      legislature, and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned actively for Horace
      Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S. Treasury during Chester
      Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home
      for Sunday breakfast, as he did on December 2 and 9, 1877 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a description of
      these breakfasts, see <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed.
      William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel,
      see George R. Prowell's <em>The History of Camden County, New
         Jersey</em> (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n4284">7. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="n4102">8. John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
