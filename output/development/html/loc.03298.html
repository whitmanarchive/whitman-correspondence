      <br></br>Washington, D.C.
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">February 1, 1885.<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.03298_n13" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I have long wanted to write to you, but have been shockingly
      crowded down with work, and I have nearly forty letters unanswered. Your postal of
      Monday last came duly.<sup><a href="#loc.03298_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> Also the <u>Springfield Republican</u>.<sup><a href="#loc.03298_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> How deliciously like
      my old friend Henry Peterson is that critical exegesis
      on your lines! I shall certainly send it to Bucke that he may be convinced of the
      error of his ways by it, as I have of mine! 
   </p>
   
   <p> Your poem about the Arctic snow-bird is beautiful.<sup><a href="#med.00762_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> I
      send a slip from the Washington <u>Hatchet</u>
       to let you see
      your article on Shakespeare reproduced. Did I tell you (probably not) about getting
      a letter from Mr. Gibson, the Librarian of the Shakespeare Memorial Library at
      Stratford-on-Avon? This is a gorgeous stone building, all carved and paneled oak
      inside, containing a library, a reading-room, a grand hall, a museum of Shakespeare
      Memorials, etc. The librarian wrote me, very liberally asking me to send to the
      library anything I had written in favor of the Baconian theory, saying that the
      management wished to give house-room to anything related to the subject (Fact is,
      those fellows over there are beginning to feel the force of the Baconian claim. It
      is the sign of the rising of  the tide, and ten years ago such a request would not have been
      made.) I at once sent Mr. Gibson a copy of Bucke's book,<sup><a href="#loc.03298_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      writing on the fly-leaf—"To the Stratford Memorial Library", together with
      this time, a sort of twistification of a line from Sophocles, "May the truth
      prevail!" In December last, I got a very polite and cordial acknowledgement from the
      librarian, in which he says: "Many thanks for your kind remembrance of my letter,
      and the welcome gift of the life of Walt Whitman,
      in which is included your letter to Dr. R. M. Bucke, referring to the Bacon and Shakespeare
      controversy, which renders the volume admissable  to our library. I am glad to
      handle the volume, and hope, ere a few days are over, to become better acquainted
      with the personal history of your great American Poet. The beautiful portrait of the
      Poet in 1880, to Chapter 2, is exquisite and adds much to our interest in reading
      his life. His poems are not so well known here as Bryant, Longfellow or Whittier,
      but they are gradually becoming better appreciated as they are studied. Of all the
      American poets, Longfellow has the widest popularity, and his writings are better
      known than most of the English poets.".......So, you see, there you are lodged in
       the great
      Memorial at Stratford, close by Shakespeare's tomb. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I must tell you something funny. You know what I say in Bucke's book, page 91, about
      Dr. Kuno Fischer, ending with the observation that it is strange that having gone
      so
      far in seeing the Shakespearean connection with Bacon, he did not take the step that
      would seem inevitable. Now comes the news that he has taken the inevitable step!<sup><a href="#loc.03298_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup> Mrs Pott writes me from
      London that he has come out squarely for the Baconian theory,<sup><a href="#loc.03298_n6" id="r7">7</a></sup> and was to give a course of lectures on the subject this
      winter at the 
      University of Heidelberg, where he is professor of philosophy and literature. So it
      would seem my words were prophetic. This is the most important accession to the
      theory yet made. Dr. Fischer is a very eminent man, widely known in Europe, and his
      advocacy will carry weight. There is a string of eminent German professors who have
      also come out for the cause, notably among whom is Dr. Karl Müller of
      Stuttgard. He has translated our Appleton Morgan's "Shakespeare Myth"<sup><a href="#loc.03298_n7" id="r8">8</a></sup> into German and it will have the honor of being
      published by the great house of Lanchnitz.<sup><a href="#loc.03298_n8" id="r9">9</a></sup> All this will
      be gall and wormwood  to the literary gang here who, for years, in their effort to
      suppress us, have acted like the Dragon of Wantley<sup><a href="#n4965" id="r10">10</a></sup> in his dying moments. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Mrs Pott writes me that the cause grows daily in England, a number of old scholars,
      not publicly known, but men of learning and judgement, having given their adhesion,
      and the young men at Oxford and Cambridge also joining in numbers, and getting ready
      to fight for Bacon. Hooray! Meanwhile, I bide my time in the cellar. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Here is something decidedly rich which I heard a couple of weeks since, and tell
      you
      in confidence, so as not to compromise the narrator. It is extremely  creamy. You
      know, or you do not know, that Osgood &amp; Co,<sup><a href="#loc.03298_n9" id="r11">11</a></sup> besides
      being publishers, also run the Heliotype Company, which does beautiful work in that
      line, in reproducing maps, plans, engravings, illustrations, etc. They have an
      office here, and their agent is a Boston man, a very nice fellow, named Coolidge.
      I
      am interested in a little enterprise in his line which brings me into connection
      with him. The other day I was in his office, and in chatting, referring to a 
      beautifully published life of "Home-Sweet-Home" Payne<sup><a href="#n4964" id="r12">12</a></sup> by the firm, I remarked that
      Osgood got out books in splendid style.  Coolidge assented, but somewhat
      wistfully. "Why", said I, "don't you think so?" "O yes," he hastily answered,
      "but"—."But what?"—I asked, laughing. "Well," said Coolidge slowly,
      after a pause, "Osgood's a good fellow, and we all like him, but I'm afraid as a
      publisher, he's going down." "Going down!"—I repeated. "Why how's that?" "Well,"
      returned Coolidge, "I mean that he's losing his grip." "Losing his grip as a
      publisher!" I exclaimed: "Why, Coolidge, how has that happened?" "Well," he
      returned: then after a long pause, he continued briskly, "Did you ever hear  of a man named
      Walt Whitman, who wrote a book called <u>Leaves of Grass</u>?" I
      admitted that I had heard of this man, and of his book. Then he went on to tell me,
      very circumstantially, that Osgood had solicited the publication of the book, got
      it
      out in good style, and was selling it right along, when the District Attorney
      threatened him with prosecution, etc., etc., (you and I know all this) when he got
      scared, broke his contract and stopped the publication. "What an infernal fool!" I
      excalimed, just here. "Fool!" returned Coolidge, "I should say so! Why that was his
      chance! He  ought
      to have told the District Attorney to go to hell, publicly defied him, and set all
      his presses to work. He'd have sold a hundred thousand copies in a month, and
      nothing could have been done to him." Then he went on to tell me that the affair
      made a great buzz, that Osgood was universally condemned for his cowardice, and
      thought to have acted dishonorably, that in consequence a blight fell upon him, and
      that he had lost his grip as a publisher for the present, and might be going down.
      "If he does go down," concluded Coolidge,  "it will all be because of his
      conduct toward Walt Whitman". 
   </p>
   
   <p> Such is the outline of what Coolidge said, and considering that it was told me as
      to
      one who knew nothing of the matter, and by an intimate agent of the house, you may
      imagine my satisfaction. It was a real comfort to know that although we got so
      little support in the matter form "the organs of public opinion," there was a public
      feeling broad and deep enough to put the brand upon the miserable 
      pedler
      
       who did this mean wrong. I rejoiced exceedingly to have learned it. 
   </p> 
   
   <p> Isn't it a sweet sequel?  Don't let Scovel<sup><a href="#n1049" id="r13">13</a></sup> print it (as the
      divvle did my note to him: Wasn't I astonished!) for I wouldn't have Coolidge
      injured in Osgood's regard for the world, though I wouldn't care a continental how
      widely it was known that a blight had fallen upon Osgood for his treatment of you,
      provided the news came without a source being specified. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Gosse's<sup><a href="#n0273" id="r14">14</a></sup> visit to you, and his kind and respectful words,
      inexpressibly gratified [
      <span class="unclear">m?</span>]
      e. What gave it all point was that he has been fêted
      to the very top by the literati  and aristocracy everywhere in this country, and I "phansy their
      pheelinks", in Yellowplush phrase,<sup><a href="#n4963" id="r15">15</a></sup> at contemplating the tableau. 
   </p>
   
   <p> —But I must break off. I wonder if my life-saving career<sup><a href="#n4962" id="r16">16</a></sup> draws to an end.
      March fourth comes near. Despite the terrible routine of the office work, so
      wearying and confining, I am deeply interested in the noble work of the service, and
      should be sorry to leave it. I think, however, the pressure f[
      <span class="unclear">or?</span>]
       Kimball's place<sup><a href="#loc.03298_n11" id="r17">17</a></sup> and mine will be terribly urgent, and  already we hear
      of many aspirants. Our successors will never do what we have done—fill the
      stations with the best professionals, no matter what their politics, and so make the
      life-saving work part of the national glory. Well, we'll see what Cleveland will do.
      What a chance he has generally to break down the infamous spoils system!<sup><a href="#loc.03298_n12" id="r18">18</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I have a fine picture of Bacon, after Vandyck, which I am going to send you soon.

      1885, in the <em>Springfield Republican</em>, Henry Peterson
      (1818–1891), apparently a fellow writer, seemed to take issue with a
      passage in "Song of Myself" in which Whitman writes: "I think I could turn and
      live with the animals, they are so placid and self contained; / [...] / Not one
      is responsible or industrious over the whole earth." The <em>Republican</em>, on the other hand, disagrees: "Even the fiercer animals
      are 'industrious' enough—they would starve if they were not. And thus it
      seems to be that Mr Whitman is nearly all wrong as to the animals. They are not
      as contented and happy as he makes them out to be."<a href="#r3">[back]

      psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading (and later memorizing) <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 and later meeting the poet in
      Camden in 1877; in 1872, though, Bucke claimed that a reading of Whitman's
      poetry led the psychiatrist to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an
      overwhelming sense of epiphany. For more on the relationship of Bucke and

   <p id="n1049">13. James Matlock Scovel began to
      practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War he was in the New Jersey
      legislature, and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned actively for Horace
      Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S. Treasury during Chester
      Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home
      for Sunday breakfast, as he did on December 2 and 9, 1877 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a description of
      these breakfasts, see <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed.
      William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel,

   <p id="n0273">14. Sir Edmund William Gosse (1849–1928), English
      poet and author of <em>Father and Son</em> (a memoir published in
      1907), had written to Whitman on : "I can but thank you for all that I have learned from you, all the
      beauty you have taught me to see in the common life of healthy men and women,
      and all the pleasure there is in the mere humanity of other people" (see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.65.html">Friday, June 1, 1888</a>). Gosse reviewed <em>Two
         Rivulets</em> in "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/rivulets/anc.00075.html">Walt Whitman's New Book</a>," <em>The Academy</em>, 9 (24
      June 1876), 602–603, and visited Whitman in 1885 (see Whitman's letter

      <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–1977], 3:384 n80). In a letter to
      Richard Maurice Bucke on , Whitman
      characterized Gosse as "one of the amiable conventional wall-flowers of
      literature" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). For more about Gosse, see Jerry F.
      King, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_112.html">Gosse, Sir Edmund (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
