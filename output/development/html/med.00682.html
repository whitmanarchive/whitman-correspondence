      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send to-day by mail the three Vols. of your Emerson so long detained—deepest
      apologies for not returning them before<sup><a href="#?" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I don't know that I
      have any thing to tell you of any account. I am not writing any thing. Have a small
      screed of three or four pages to appear in A T Rice's forthcoming <em>Reminiscences of Lincoln</em>, but I consider it unworthy the theme.<sup><a href="#?" id="r2">2</a></sup> James Redpath, who manages things for A T R, has been very good to
      me—persistently so—&amp; it is to his urgency I have
      responded—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Have not yet finished the <em>Army Hospital</em> article for the <em>Century</em>, but intend to do so forthwith.<sup><a href="#?" id="r3">3</a></sup> Had
      a violent spell of illness 
      ab't
      
       a week ago—remained in bed all last Friday—am up since, &amp;
      go out a little, but don't feel even as half-well as usual.<sup><a href="#?" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      Beautiful here to-day &amp; I am enjoying the sunshine, sitting here by the window,
      looking out—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Have read my <em>Death of Abraham Lincoln</em> paper <em>twice</em> this spring, on applications ($25 and $30)<sup><a href="#?" id="r5">5</a></sup>—got along with it rather slowly, but 
      didnt
      
       break down, &amp; seems to have given a sort of satisfaction—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Want to scoop up what I have (poems and prose) of the last MSS since 1881 and '2,
      &amp; put in probably 200 page book (or somewhat less) to be called perhaps <em>November Boughs</em>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am getting along comfortably enough here—spirits generally good—my old
      horse has quite given out<sup><a href="#?" id="r6">6</a></sup>—we have a canary bird, dog, &amp;
      parrot—all great friends of mine (&amp; teachers)—
   </p>

      Best love to you &amp; 'Sula—not forgetting the little
      boy—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
