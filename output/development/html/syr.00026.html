      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I hope your stroke of exhaustion from the heat was not as serious as the newspaper
      made it seem. I always make allowance for the reporter. The weather here for ten
      days past has been as bad as the Soudan's Torrid. At this moment (Sunday afternoon)
      the clouds have gathered heavily, and the thunder is rumbling so I suppose relief
      is
      coming. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I have had a strange illness lately, but hope I am getting better. It took the form
       of utter
      weakness, and for a fortnight I barely had the use of my legs, and tumbled down on
      the slightest provocation. I began to wonder whether I was going to match you. The
      doctor, however, says it will pass if I take great care of myself, requiring me to
      keep as quiet as possible. I suppose it comes form my being much run down. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I am glad you liked the photo. It is a good likeness, and quite powerful as a
      picture.<sup><a href="#syr.00026_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> That Bacon is a great success. If I could
      only get a steel engraving! This is only  a wood cut, and probably does small
      justice to Vandyk's portrait. The resemblance to the ideal pictures of Shakespeare
      is remarkable—I think, prophetic.—Donnelly writes me that the cipher is coming
      out gloriously. It is a complete narrative of Bacon's life and times, regularly
      underlying the text of the plays, and settles the Bacon-Shakespeare question
      conclusively. William will have to step down and out for good. I laugh when I think
      of the chagrin of the Shakespeareans, who have been so insolent and intolerant, and
      suppressed evidence with a high hand.<sup><a href="#syr.00026_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> Donnelly, when  he was here, got
      quite intimate with me, explained the law of the cipher, and read me a good deal of
      the translation. The cipher is by regular rule, which will stop the mouth of any
      caviller. It is as simple and indisputable as twice two are four, but terribly <u>laborious</u> to decipher, the process being one of continual
      counting of words. I am amazed at the revolutionary daring of the device on the part
      of Bacon. You will be surprised to see how the corruption of the text is accounted
      for. In every case, so far, where the sense  is in doubt, it is explained by the
      sacrifice of some word to the exigencies of the cipher. Doubtless the cipher will
      end by telling us where the original true manuscripts are hidden, which I will bet
      are in the Shakespeare monument (not grave) at Stratford. The scene in the cipher
      where Bacon to save the life of his servant, Henry Percy, acknowledges to Queen
      Elizabeth his own authorship of Richard Second and the other plays up to that date,
      is tremendously striking. She calls him, "Thou damned beast," clutches him by the
      beard and beats him with her crutch. No wonder  that Essex meant to stab the old
      termagant (as Bacon calls her in the cipher) with his own hand—habitually inflicting
      such indignities on the great men around her. Essex himself got a blow in the face
      from her.—All the account of Shakespeare's raid on Sir Thomas Lucy's park; his
      flight to London; his appearance, ragged and barefooted, in front of the Red Bull
      theatre, bawling for horses to hold, where Bacon first saw him, is quite rich. "A
      good-tempered, ragged wretch," is Bacon's description of him. 
   </p>
   
   <p> The bit from the "Journal of Commerce" which young Johann  sent you, shows that we still live.
      There was quite a blast for me lately in the Boston "Advertiser"—very
      friendly, but full of the oddest errors, as, for example, where he makes me very
      finicky about spelling my name with only one n (!!) and has me as librarian of the
      Department, etc. C. W. E. sent the "Journal of Commerce" a list of the poems written
      about you, requested by its correspondent. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I get the papers you send, including the <u>Tribune</u> with
      Smalley's letter about Victor Hugo,<sup><a href="#syr.00026_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> written with his
      usual admirable talent and deformed, as usual, by his meanness. He is the meannest
      man living. I always used to say he could be parsed—positive Small,
      comparative Smaller, superlative Smalley! 
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p> Victor Hugo's death much weakened my appetite for life. I read with interest what
      he
      said about Shakespeare, but the criticism about his indifference to the lower
      classes does not touch me as true. It never appears to be remarked, that of all the
      wise, compassionate, sympathetic men of that age, not one spoke up for the poor and
      downtrodden. Why? Because they could not! Victor Hugo in that age would have had to
      be silent. One single line in a scene expressing even latent sympathy with the Jack
      Cades or Wat Tylers, would have sent its author at once to the block, and the play
      itself would have been suppressed even before it had appeared, so watchful and
      relentless was the censorship. To realize the bloody, brassy, wanton rigor of the
      military despotism  then in power, one has only to note the treatment Raleigh got. The government
      was simply infernal—almost inconceivable. The only thing the illuminati of
      that day could do was to set about the slow sap of the monarchy. This was the only
      way they could rehabilitate the commons. To alter your sense a little—"the
      indirect is as great and real as the direct"—and the indirect was their only
      weapon or implement. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I too heard lately from Dr. Bucke,<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r5">5</a></sup> urging me to visit him. I
      wish you could go up there, but have no doubt you are prudent to stay near home. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Mrs. Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r6">6</a></sup> sent me  a copy of the "Today." I have
      really not had the strength or mind to read what she has written—I have been
      so ill and feeble—but intend to soon. I have no doubt her article is good, and
      when I have read it, I mean to write her my thanks. I have an awful pile of
      unanswered letters. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Decapitation, of which you ask, seems impending, and I am anxiously thinking what
      field will be open to me, when I am shoved out of here. There have been several
      people after my position already. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I wish you could get stronger in your legs. It would  be such a comfort to be able to
      move about freely. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I wrote an article defending Mrs Pott's book<sup><a href="#loc.03298_n6" id="r7">7</a></sup> from
      Richard Grant White, and bringing out several vital points in the Bacon-Shakespeare
      controversy. It was rejected by several magazines, but finally accepted by the <u>Manhattan</u>, the editor, Forman, being immensely taken with
      it. He held it a long time, hoping the magazine would resume, and surrendered it
      with evident reluctance and regret. Now I propose to bring it out in a book or
      brochure, and have written to McKay offering it to him. If you are in the way of  seeing him, give
      me a boost. I think, considering the general interest just now in the question, it
      might really have some sale. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Since I began the change has come. Last night we had a tremendous rain, and today
      it
      continued, though moderately. It is a blessed relief. (Today means Monday, the 27th.)
      
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

      Mr. Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street, | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked:

         </a></p>
   <p id="syr.00026_n2">3. O'Connor would ultimately
      publish his theses on Shakespeare in his <em>Hamlet's
         Note-Book</em>, which he understood as a "Baconian reply to R. G. White," a
      literary critic and scholar, who argued that Shakespeare was not a pseudonym of
      Francis Bacon but indeed a seperate historic figure and author. After numerous
      publishers had declined O'Connor's manuscript, it was finally published in 1886
      by Houghton, Mifflin and Company (Boston and New York). See also O'Connor's
      letter to Whitman of .<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="syr.00026_n3">4. George W. Smalley
      (1833–1916) was the London correspondent for the New York <em>Tribune</em> and renowned for his reporting of the Battle of
      Antietam.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0259">6. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03298_n6">7. Constance Mary Fearon Pott
      (1833–1914) started the Francis Bacon Society and, after comparing figures
      of speech in Bacon to Shakespeare, argued for Bacon as the author behind
      Shakespeare's famous plays. O'Connor would later publish <em>Hamlet's Note-Book</em>, subtitled "A defense of Mrs. Henry Pott" (Boston:
      Houghton, Mifflin [1886]).<a href="#r7">[back]
