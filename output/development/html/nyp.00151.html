      <br></br><br></br>Dear Father
      
   </p>
   
   <p>You will allow me to call you Father wont you. I do not know that I told you that
      both of my parents were dead but it is true and now Walt you will be a second Father
      to me wont you, for my love for you is hardly less than my love for my natural parent.
      I have never before met with a man that I could love as I do you still there is nothing
      strange about it for "to know you is to love you" and how any person could know you
      and not love you is a wonder to me. Your letter found me still here and not yet ready
      to start home  my Papers have not yet returned from headquarters. I almost wish at
      times that they would not return until you come back. Were it not for the great love
      for my wife I would stop until you returned but I still think I shall come back eer
      long. I think my papers will be in tomorrow certain.
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Comrade do not feel bad about anything you did or did not do while here. You
      did <em>much</em> and that which I prized most of all you gave me was your love and your company. One
      of these I know I have and for both I would charge all the riches in the world. As
      for your not coming to see me I felt bad about it then but now I think it only taught
      me how much I should miss you and also what a vacancy there would be in my affections
      were I to be deprived of your love as well as your company. I have not yet seen your
      letter to Brown as I did not get this until nearly dark but I will go up there in
      the morning and see if he has received it.
   </p>
   
   <p>I suppose you have heard that we received some 90 wounded men Sunday night a number
      of which were Rebels. Among the wounded were the Col and the Maj. of the 6th Wisconsin
      Regt. and quite a number of privates a great many of them were very badly wounded,
      more so than any lot I have seen come in, eight of them died while on the way. And
      now Dear Comarade I must bid you good by hoping you will enjoy your visit and when
      you return have a pleasant and safe journey be assured you will meet with a warm welcome
      from many in Armory Square. You will yet be rewarded for your kindness to the Soldiers.
      (You can direct your next either as you did the last or direct to Portage Kalamazoo
      Co. Mich) if it comes here it will be forwarded to me. I shall start as soon as my
      papers come. My love to you and now Dear Father good by for the present.  Douglass
