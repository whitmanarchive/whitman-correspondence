      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of 11 Jan.<sup><a href="#syr.00054_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> received. It is a bother about that
      draft—as I think probably it has been cashed already, and that you won't get
      the money.<sup><a href="#tex.00476_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> However, please send a line saying what
      happens. The original was posted about the 25th May last (I may have a note of exact
      date somewhere, but am away from home just now). I got no answer from you, but news
      came about that time that you were much out of sorts, and then later appeared a
      paragraph in the papers from you saying you had been ill and thanking friends for
      birthday letters remaining unanswered—so I supposed it was all right. If the
      original letter has merely been lost, the duplicate draft will of course be cashed:
      but if it has been, as I guess, intercepted, there is no practical remedy. I am
      almost certain that I registered the letter, which perhaps is an unwise thing to do
      in these cases, as it's like showing one's hand—and I may have the p.o.
      receipt for the letter at home, but of that I am not sure. Anyhow, let me know by
      p.c. how matters stand, but don't worry about it—as the letter (if necessary)
      would have to be traced from this end. The sum in question was from the Miss
      Fords,<sup><a href="#loc.01238_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> R.D. Roberts,<sup><a href="#syr.00054_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> W.
      Thompson and friends,<sup><a href="#n3025" id="r5">5</a></sup> Frank Deas,<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r6">6</a></sup> and
      myself:—as a little birthday remembrance—and we shall only be sorry at
      your receipt of it having been so delayed.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I saw Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#n4152" id="r7">7</a></sup> a day or two back in London—seems pretty
      well—told me a good bit about you. I am glad from this present letter that you
      seem a bit better, Walt. Shall be glad to see the 900-pounder edition!<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      a fine literary cannonball.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The Fords' address is Adel Grange, near Leeds.</p>
   
   
   <p>I am lecturing around a bit, in London and neighborhood, enjoying life well—a
      wonderful feeling of new social life in the air—though the days are foggy and
      we see no sun.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="tex.00476_n2">2. Whitman explained the
      error at length (with many interpolations) in <em>The
         Commonplace-Book</em>: "A <em>very bad</em> (never so bad
      before) lapse of my own memory. Edw'd Carpenter sent me a bank draft $174:37,
      last part of May, '88, wh' by Lou or Mrs: D[avis] I deposited (I was very ill at
      the time bedfast) in Bank July 2. Then in Jan: '89, not hearing of the first
      draft &amp; fearing it lost, E C sent me <em>the same draft</em>
      in duplicate, &amp; I forgetting all ab't the <em>first</em> (I
      had not rec'd it &amp; supposing it lost) deposited it &amp; was credited in
      Bank. Of course on presenting it for payment (to J M Shoemaker &amp; Co.
      bankers) they spoke of the paid original draft, &amp; I gave the Camden bank my
      cheque $174:37" (<em>The Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E.

      Congress, Washington, D.C.). See Whitman's  letter to Carpenter, and Carpenter's reply on .

   <p id="loc.01238_n2">3. Isabella Ford
      (1855–1924) was an English feminist, socialist, and writer. Elizabeth
      (Bessie) Ford was her sister. Both were introduced to Whitman's writings by
      Edward Carpenter and they quickly became admirers of the aged poet.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="syr.00054_n2">4. In Carpenter's  letter to Whitman, he describes
      Roberts as a "Cambridge fellow lecturer . . . a Welshman."<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n3025">5. Joseph William Thompson was a
      lawyer from London and member of the Middle Temple, one of the four Inns of
      Court of the city. He was called to the bar in 1879. Thompson was the 5th son of
      Charles Thompson of Preswylfa near Cardiff, a member of the Society of Friends
      (Joseph Foster, <em>Men-at-the-bar: A Biographical Hand-list of
         the Members of the Various Inns</em> [London and Avlesbury: Hazell, Watson

   <p id="n4152">7. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">8. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
