   <p>Your notes<sup><a href="#med.00433_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> inviting me to write about Spiritualism reached me during a late severe spell of
      illness, 
      which will account for their not being answered at the time. I thank you for your
      courtesy, 
      but I am neither disposed nor able to write anything about this so-called Spiritualism.
      
      (It seems to me nearly altogether a poor, cheap, crude humbug.)

   <p id="med.00433_n1">1. When this letter was
      printed on December 19, 1874, the newspaper item stated that Whitman had been
      sent a circular and an "accompanying letter." The <em>Daily
         Graphic</em> had printed in other issues comments (mostly sympathetic) on
      the subject. This letter was discovered by Professor Harold W. Blodgett.<a href="#r1">[back]
