      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman
      <br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>By my sister Nell's<sup><a href="#duk.00436_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> request I send you today by mail the
      best copy I could find of my Medical Electricity. The book is now out of print. When
      published in 1849 it was the most extended treatise in the English language, &amp;
      it was original in almost all of its generalizations, in many of its observations
      &amp; in quite a number of instruments now used all over the world, as well as in
      the collection &amp; analysis of reported cases. It has been replaced by a score of
      much more pretentious
      books, published by medical 
      electricilians
      
       in this country who have made my work their staple &amp; appropriated it
      without credit, while of course adding new material! A few European works have
      appeared containing men &amp; valuable matter, &amp; the science has grown so as to
      give the more recent publications a wider field &amp; more assured ground. But I
      feel obliged to say, (&amp; I think I do it impartially) that the later authors in
      this country have been all or almost all deficient either in thorough electrical or
      thorough physiological training, &amp; their books are apt to contain [
      <span class="unclear">crotchets?</span>]
       or are sometimes
      obviously wrtten to advertise a practitioner or to magnify &amp; [
      <span class="unclear">mystify?</span>]
       his peculiar
      methods. I have never
      listed a public complaint of the appropriation of my modest book, &amp; have always
      formed sufficient recompense in the certainty that I have been of use in extending
      this application of electricity &amp; perhaps in being the first to present an
      outline of electro-medical science.
   </p>
   
   <p>Excuse this long personal history of the book. I wrote to my sister my haunting fear
      that you might use electricity prematurely &amp; incautiously &amp; I rejoiced to
      hear that your physician agreed with me. In a word electricity must not be used
      while there is <u>existing lesion</u> of the brain or 
      nerve-centres
      
      . On the other hand as irritation or inflammation of the nerve 
      centres
      
       has been subdued by medical treatment, or overcome by rest &amp; the recuperative
      forces of nature, electricity properly applied will almost always restore the 
      paralysed
      
       members &amp; functions. The exceptions are only where structural change
      of nerve 
      centres
      
       or nerves has taken place to an extent beyond repair. But premature use of
      electricity, while there is existing lesion of the brain may induce congestion,
      apoplexy or convulsions. The proper way is to make the first experiment <u>cautiously</u>. It thus becomes possible to employ it as soon
      as it is indicated.
   </p>
   
   <p>The direct current of the <u>galvanic battery</u> (12 to 50
      pairs), applied intermittently, is much more effective in the last resort than the
      electromagnetic, &amp; often less disturbing.
   </p>
   
   <p>We heard of your sickness with great sorrow. I for one have felt my indebtedness to you for great
      thoughts &amp; words more than ever before. I found in a book store a few days since
      a copy of your first (folio) edition, &amp; I purchased it with a feeling of good
      omen.
   </p>
   
   <p>If I should say a word more to you as physician it would be that what you most need
      is entire rest of your habitually overworked brain. Undoubtedly travel &amp; change
      of scene for a year would help you most after recovery has fairly commenced. But you
      ought <u>not</u> to go to England where excitement would await
      you. A course of Continental French, German, Swiss travel &amp; a mediterranean
      (Sicilian or Grecian) climate for your next winter would be my ideal.
   </p>
   
   <p>Jeannie<sup><a href="#loc.01257_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> sends you her kindest regards &amp; sympathy. She has intended to write
      you.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William F. Channing
      (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
      Whitman stayed at his home in October, 1868.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00436_n3">1. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor
      was the wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Walt Whitman's
      staunchest defenders. Walt may have mentioned a potential visit by Nelly and her
      daughter during his May visit to Brooklyn, though whether a visit came near this
      time is not known from his or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters. Walt Whitman
      dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington years, and he spoke
      often in his letters of their daughter Jean (called "Jenny" or "Jeannie").
      Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break off their friendship in late
      1872 over a disagreement about Reconstruction policies and the role of
      emancipated slaves, Nelly would remain friendly with Whitman. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.01257_n1">2. Ellen M. O'Connor's sister,
      Mary Jane "Jeannie" (Tarr) Channing (1828–1897). Walt Whitman visited

      October 1868 visit to Providence, Rhode Island.<a href="#r2">[back]
