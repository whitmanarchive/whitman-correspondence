      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been through "Specimen Days and Collect" pretty thoroughly,<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r1">1</a></sup> it is well printed
      and I find remarkably few corrections of any kind required—I enclose a list of
      what I have found. This makes
      about six times that I have read "Democratic Vistas" it is a wonderfull piece of writing, as fine in some
      respects as any thing in L. of G. but of course has not the life, fire, inspiration
      (or whatever you may call it) of such poems as "Song of Myself" "A Song of the Open
      Road" and a good many others, however I now take back entirely what I once said to
      you about "Democratic Vistas" to the effect that some other man might have written
      it. At the present moment I do not believe any other man who ever lived might or
      could have written it any more than any other man could have written
      "Calamus"—I go to Toronto tomorrow on some government business, shall be gone
      a few days, I want to hear from you, how you keep, when you are coming here &amp;c
      &amp;c
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      I am with much love
      <br></br>Affectionately yours
      <br></br>R M Bucke

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
