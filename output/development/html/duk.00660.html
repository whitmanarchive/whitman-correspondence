      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing particular for me to write about. I am well as usual, and getting
      along
      all right, except the hot weather. That continues here without much let up—Mother,
      I
      hope the things have arrived by this time, &amp; that you have got your bed fixed. I have
      had a visitor to–day &amp; yesterday, a young Hungarian gentleman, quite agreeable,
      talks English well, quite a traveler—went over to the White House with him yesterday,
      &amp; went all through—the President &amp; family are away, but Gen. Dent<sup><a href="#duk.00660_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> conducted us through, &amp; was very polite. Mrs. O'Connor<sup><a href="#duk.00660_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> made me a call Saturday, &amp; John Burroughs
      to–day—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother dear, as soon as I hear from you, I will write more particular about my coming
      to
      Camden for a day or two.<sup><a href="#duk.00660_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Mother, I shall probably send the order
      in my next.
   </p>

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00660_n1">1. General Frederick T. Dent
      (1821–1891) was Grant's aide-de-camp during the Civil War and his military
      secretary during his administration.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00660_n2">2. It is a reasonable conjecture that the
      fracas between Walt Whitman and O'Connor occurred about this time; see Horace
      Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (1906–1996), <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.11.html">3:75–78</a>, and Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1931),
      96–99.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00660_n3">3. Walt Whitman visited Camden early in
      September; he wrote of this visit in his  letter to Rudolf Schmidt.<a href="#r3">[back]
