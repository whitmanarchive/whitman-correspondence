      <br></br><br></br>Dear W—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was pleased to get your brief word about yourself, even though you report your
      imprisonment. I am glad you have been able to bring your books<sup><a href="#n6127" id="r1">1</a></sup> so near completion.
      No one could have done it but yourself with the same satisfaction to your
      friends.
   </p>
   
   <p>There seems to be a sort of providence in  one's life who has the courage to
      peg away, &amp; to wait, when he can't peg. Somehow the pegging gets done at what
      finally seems to have been the right &amp; opportune moment; &amp; the world
      abides.
   </p>
   
   <p>One has no business to be disappointed, or to stay so long—<u>He</u> don't know. The Enquirer cries "stop"—"cant be"—"wait" "get
      sick—stay sick"—"die"  "Dont die"—"start
      up"—"at it now"—"There! See?—How easy? What was your fuming
      about?"—"Now, a good laugh before you die.—All's well!"
   </p>
   
   <p><u>This</u> to the <u>Ideal</u> worker.
   </p>
   
   <p>The "<u>business</u> man" with possessions rash (won or to be won)
      has his turbulations, but of another sort.
   </p>
   
   <p>No such humiliations—and no such victims!</p>
   
   <p>I went yesterday to hear Prof Swing preach. If you dont know about him, Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r2">2</a></sup> will tell you. He said some bright things. One: "Many promising
       lad goes
      through Cambridge &amp; Oxford &amp; on through time into oblivion quoting his Greek
      &amp; Latin. And many a poor [
      <span class="unclear">unfriended?</span>]
       boy rises up out of the gutter where he was born &amp;
      climbs into the heights of knowledge &amp; wisdom. Verily the <u>Spirit</u> cares for its own." (Or words to this effect). Chicago has better
      preachers than Boston. There is greater inspiration in their utterances. They seem
      to be spiritually more awake—<u>alert</u>. Foreglancing,
      foreseeing! The great, vast bulk of of a city weighs on the senses like a nightmare,
      but if one doesnt care a button for his fine senses, he can escape into a great
      liberation of music &amp; spirit.  "What is your city with its
      temples &amp; walls? I can tear it all down &amp; build it again in three days,"
      said Jesus.
   </p>
   
   <p>How the old sense-ridden Jew must have glowered &amp; foamed!</p>
   
   <p>"Why, it would take a hundred years to build the walls alone."</p>
   
   <p>Chicago has been a building for 50 years only. And what a wonderful spread it has
      made! I like it, I enjoy it. The boulevards stretching miles  miles white &amp; clean— 
      [
      <span class="unclear">yea?</span>]
      , as far as the eye can reach,
      make me stop &amp; look up &amp; down there a long time. I dont care much for the
      great buildings—from the tops of some of them you can almost touch the moon.
      I like to get on the grip-car &amp; ride through the long tunnel—every now
      &amp; then a [
      <span class="unclear">rick?</span>]
       with a small electric light. Everybody was saying "Look out for
      the grip-car or you'll get killed. So many have."
   </p>
   
   <p>Ha, ha, ha! What cowards  these people be! Make things, &amp; then get afraid of them.</p>
   
   <p>The Lincoln statue is good. The face has a vast deal in it. The figure is Lincolnish.
      I have seen it now 3 times, &amp; I find a little fault with it eternally standing
      there before that chair. The chair part is as the cities say, "a bold conception,"
      but whether tis not an infraction of the old Greek admonition, as being "too bold?"
      I
      believe on the whole, I would not have put it there—or anywhere. The modeling
      is strong, but a little too much done. The hair, however, is better than represented
      in the engraving &amp;
      on the whole, I know of [illegible]  other public statue as good.
   </p>
   
   <p>But on the shirts here I find some half 
      dozzen 
      
       statues (Scott,<sup><a href="#n4277" id="r3">3</a></sup> Burns,<sup><a href="#loc.01153_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; others) done by some unfamed fellow for $100
      ends in grey sandstone, that far surpasses it. I find myself always stopped by them
      with a half defined expectancy that they are going to say something to me. By the
      way this stone would be just the thing for your bust. Beats marble a hundred per
      cent.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, I should like to see you that I might at least lay aside this scratchy pen,
      &amp; say &amp; hear you say. But—. I have no studio yet, but am on the look
      for one, with some encouragement of work. Rent here is way up. Kind remembrances to
      your faithful housekeeper.<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n6127">1. Morse is probably referring to <em>November Boughs</em>, which would be published in October 1888
      and to <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em>, which would be
      published in December 1888.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

   <p id="n4277">3. Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832)
      was a Scottish statesman, historical novelist, playwright, and poet, best known
      for <em>Ivanhoe</em> (1820), <em>The Lady of the
         Lake</em> (1810), and <em>Waverly</em> (1814). For more on
      Scott, see Vickie L. Taft, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_209.html">Scott, Sir Walter (1771)–1832)</a>," <em>Walt
