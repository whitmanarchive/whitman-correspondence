   </p>
   
   
   <p>I must write not because I have anything to tell you—but because I want so, by
      help of a few loving words, to come into your presence as it were—into your
      remembrance  Not more
      do the things that grow want the sun. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received all the papers—&amp; each has made a day very bright for me. </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope the trip to California has not again had to be postponed—I realize  well the enjoyment of
      it, &amp; what it would be to California &amp; the fresh impulses of thought &amp;
      emotion that would shape themselves, melodiously out of that for the new
      volume— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My children are all well. Beatrice is
      working hard to get through the requisite  amount of [
      <span class="unclear">Latin</span>]
       &amp;c.
      
      that is required in the preliminary examination—before entering on medical
      studies. Percy my eldest, whom I have not seen for a year
      is coming to spend Xmas with us. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
