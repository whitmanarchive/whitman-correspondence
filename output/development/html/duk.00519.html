   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00519_n11">1. This letter dates to March
      11, 1868. The date, "March 11," is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard
      Maurice Bucke dated the letter to 1868, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with
      Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:365). The year 1868 is consistent
      with subjects in letters to Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman and to Charles
      Heyde and with a <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> advertisement for a
      prospective room for rent on Carlton Avenue.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00519_n8">3. George Washington Whitman
      inspected pipe at the R. D. Wood foundry in Camden, New Jersey, on behalf of
      Moses Lane of the Brooklyn Water Works, but "stan the foundry man" has not been
      identified.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00518_n3">4. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. The
      connection between Lane and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, who had served
      under Lane before accepting the position of Chief Engineer at the St. Louis
      Water Works, led to George Washington Whitman's employment as a pipe inspector
      in Brooklyn. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in her  letter reported Jeff Whitman's confidence that George's
      connection to Lane offered assurance of stable employment. George's position
      with the Brooklyn Water Works became more tenuous in 1869 after the
      reorganization of the Brooklyn Board of Water Commissioners in April: Lane
      resigned after the new board was seated (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman). Lane later designed and
      constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city engineer, and he
      again employed George to inspect pipe in Camden, New Jersey ("Moses Lane," <em>Proceedings of the American Society of Civil Engineers</em>
      [February 1882], 58).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00519_n6">5. Advertised as the "SECOND
      FLOOR and part of third, six rooms" including "water and gas," the rooms were
      located at 407 Carlton Avenue and listed at a rate of $50 per month ("Houses to
      Let," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, March 7, 1868, 3).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00519_n12">6. The Portland Avenue home
      that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman shared with Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman was rented to the family of John Brown, a
      tailor (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). The relationship between
      the Browns and the Whitmans was often strained, especially in regard to the
      noise made by Jeff and Mattie's daughter Hattie, but the Browns remained in the
      Portland Avenue house for five years. See Jeff Whitman's  and 
      letters to Walt. Louisa maintained cordial relations with the Browns after the
      departure of Jeff, Mattie, and family to St. Louis in 1868. See Louisa's  letter to Walt, in which she
      described a visit to Mrs. Brown and added that "if Jeff and matt knew i had been
      to see mrs Brown they would cross me off their books."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00519_n7">7. Mrs. Black was a neighbor of
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. She is also mentioned in Louisa's , , and 
      letters to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00519_n13">8. Walt Whitman's early March
      1868 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not known.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">9. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00519_n14">10. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman's letter is not extant, but Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman described
      dissatisfaction with hotel life in her February 1, 1868 letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman. They soon moved to a new home on Olive Street. See Mattie's
      March 20, 1868 letter to Louisa (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1977], 44–46, 50–53).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00519_n5">11. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      wrote that she had sent "a pressing letter to hannah urging her to come and make
      us a visit" (see her  letter to Walt
      Whitman). Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's youngest daughter, resided in Burlington, Vermont, with husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and treatment of
      Hannah.<a href="#r11">[back]
