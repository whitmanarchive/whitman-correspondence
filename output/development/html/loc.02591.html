      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Many years have rolled by since I last shook hands with you on Fulton 
      st
      
       Brooklyn.<sup><a href="#loc.02591_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I can see you now as you looked then tall and hearty—in a
      grey woolen shirt, turned down collar—bare bronzed neck—bearded face
      crowned with a soft broad brimmed slouched hat—a supple active form holding a
      heart wide awake for whatever might betide sunshine or storm!—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In those days I scribbled sometimes for the Eagle over which you presided. I loved
      to
      work what good I could for the Sunday School of Old St Ann's for its missions and
      our City's poor—you were always ready to
      aid in such good work—
   </p>
   
   <p>I was young then, and light hearted—I am a Widow now with a son 27, and two
      daughters younger, Edith and Anna;<sup><a href="#loc.02591_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Anna has been two years a student of 
      Ellocution    
      
       with Gabriel Harrison,<sup><a href="#duk.00426_19" id="r3">3</a></sup> whom doubtless you will remember  she has been
      invited to recite at an entertainment given by "Winchester Post," at their annual
      installation of
      officers Jan. 5th<sup><a href="#loc.02591_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>She will recite the first time <u>for her your</u> poem "The dirge
      of the two Veterans" musical accompaniment by F Ritter,<sup><a href="#loc.01135_n8" id="r5">5</a></sup> she will be accompanied on
      the Organ by Professor Raphael Navarro an old Brooklynite.<sup><a href="#loc.02591_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>She is now in the parlor rehearsing the piece with her sister. Ah dear old friend
      as
      I hear from her young lips those soul stirring words of yours my heart strings
      thrill—the last years are back again fresh and green and I feel old things are
       best. I hear
      again the clear ring of your voice, and feel the warm clasp of your true hand.
   </p>
   
   <p>I feel ere the shadows of Evening close around, as if, I must write to you, if only,
      to say God Bless you, and your dear ones,—and give to you and them a happy <u>most happy</u> New Year.
   </p>
   
   <p>My children join me in love and good wishes.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anna M. Kerr (died 1920) was a
      Brooklyn-born church-worker and social activist from a prominent Quaker family.
      Throughout her life, Kerr was a member of numerous charitable, religious, and
      social organizations such as the Women's Club of Brooklyn as well as the local
      Junior Missionary Society or the Asylum Society. Her death was covered by the
      <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, which remembered her as
      "artistic, musical and [with] a personality of winning charm" (5 January, 1920,
      3).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02591_n1">1. Fulton Street was not only
      home to the landing of the Brooklyn ferry but also to the offices of the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02591_n2">2. Her obituary in the <em>Daily Eagle</em> surprisingly only mentions two siblings as
      surviving relatives, suggesting that her children might have died before
      her.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00426_19">3. According to the <em>Brooklyn City Directory</em> (1863), Gabriel Harrison was a
      photographer at 73 Fulton Avenue. He was a friend of Whitman's and took the
      daguerreotypes that Whitman used for the engraved portrait of himself that
      appeared in the 1855 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In
      addition to being an award-winning daguerreotypist, Harrison was also a writer,
      actor, painter, and stage manager, and he remained for Whitman one of the true
      artisan-heroes of the era.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02591_n3">4. The installation of the
      newly elected officers of Winchester Post No. 179, G. A. R., took place in the
      Conservatory of Music on Fulton Street.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01135_n8">5. Frédéric Louis
      Ritter, composer and professor at Vassar College (see the letter from Whitman to
      John Burroughs of ) composed a
      setting for "Dirge for Two Veterans." Kenneth P. Neilson, in <em>The World of Walt Whitman Music: A Bibliographical Study</em> (1963), lists
      only one work by Ritter.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02591_n4">6. Probably organist Rafael
      Navarro, the teacher of well-known Brooklyn hymnist John Hyatt Brewer
      (1856–1931).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
