      all dropped off i havent  had
      a letter from Matty<sup><a href="#duk.00465_n9" id="r2">2</a></sup>

      he promised
      he would write as soon as he
      arrived i told him if he was
      busy when he got back for
      matty to write because i wanted
      to hear but i have not got any
      if they have wrote to me i
      have not got it i think maybee 
      they have and it has been taken
      and han<sup><a href="#duk.00543_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup>

      her letter she would never

   <p>be so long again without
      writing
      but i suppose they
      all have enoughf  to doo  without
      writing when one gets out of the
      way of writing its hard to get
      in it again matty was going
      to write to me so often she
      said before shee  went away
      she would write every week
      i got the papers to day with the letter

      to get out of this place very much
      i went yesterday to look at one
      in carlton aven  just out of fulton<sup><a href="#duk.00543_n14" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      but it was no better nor any
      more room than we have here
      
      
      
      and 10 doll  more rent a month
      i would rather live here than
      there and all the places i have
      been to see was something that
      would make it disagreable 
      in some way or other) here i
      can doo  just as i like but
      of course there is some disagreable 
      things but they are all as clever
      to me as they can bee) george
      has lots of fun about their calling
      me lady whitman the family
      that has come in up stairs has
      five children but i think she
      is very clean woman and
      the children seems orderly
      but they have to run up and
      down so there is some noise
      i told george yesterday
      i wasent  going any where
      to look at any more houses
      but was going to wait for
      something to turn up i am
      quite lame in one of my
      knees i dont  know what
      makes it so it pains me
      considerable i suppose it
      
      
      must be the rheumatism<sup><a href="#duk.00515_n14" id="r10">10</a></sup>

      hardly walk and then it will
      be better to day it feels quite 
      bad on account perhaps of the 
      appearance of a storm)

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00543_n16">1. This letter dates to May 5,
      1868. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter May 5, 1868, and Edwin Haviland
      Miller cited the same date (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:366). The mark between Louisa's month and the number "5" is probably a
      superscript "th"; her placement of the superscript for ordinal designation
      varies widely, but it may be an inverted signature.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">2. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">3. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00543_n1">4. Jeff and Mattie Whitman had
      relocated from Brooklyn to St. Louis with their daughters. Jeff moved to St.
      Louis in May 1867 to assume the position of chief engineer of the St. Louis
      Water Works, and Mattie and daughters Manahatta and Jessie Louisa joined Jeff in
      St. Louis in January 1868. Louisa grew increasingly anxious about the absence of
      letters from Jeff and Mattie, a concern that Mattie acknowledged in her June 8,
      1868 letter (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of
         Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977],
      54–56).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00543_n2">5. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided
      in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a
      French-born landscape painter. Charles was infamous among the Whitmans for his
      offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Louisa often spoke disparagingly
      of Charles in her letters to Walt Whitman. On , she wrote, "i had a letter or package from charley hay three
      sheets of foolscap paper and a fool wrote on them."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00543_n3">6. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      probably refers to the <em>Illustrated Chicago News</em>, a
      periodical that began a brief run on April 24, 1868, "a very creditable weekly,
      with illustrations by Thomas Nast and other well known artists" (Frank W. Scott
      and Edmund Janes James, ed., <em>Newspapers and Periodicals of
         Illinois, 1814–1879</em> [Springfield: Illinois State Historical
      Library, 1910], 92).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00543_n13">7. The first of May was the
      proverbial moving day in Brooklyn as year-long leases expired. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman paraphrased the assessment of a newspaper article: "increasing and
      exorbitant rents asked for houses and apartments this year have driven hundreds
      of families to the necessity of giving up housekeeping" ("High Rents and
      Housekeeping," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, May 5, 1868,
      3).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00543_n10">8. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years
      Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until
      the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg
      (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove
      (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Smith and later a mason named French. By
      1868, the house business is balanced against George's work as an inspector of
      pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on George Washington Whitman,
      see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00543_n14">9. Advertised as "Part of
      House No. 340 Carlton ave[nue], comprising 4 rooms on the second floor and 2
      attic bedrooms" ("Boarding," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, May 1,
      1868, 3).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00515_n14">10. Rheumatism or arthritic
      rheumatism, which Louisa also spelled "rheumattis" or "rhumatis," is joint pain,
      which was attributed to dry joints. See <em>Health at Home, or
         Hall's Family Doctor</em> (Hartford: J. A. S. Betts, 1873), 704.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00543_n4">11. John A. Bingham
      (1815–1900), representative from Ohio who served as a manager during the
      impeachment proceedings of President Andrew Johnson in the Senate, presented the
      closing argument for removing the president from office. Though not considered a
      Radical Republican, Bingham argued for Johnson's removal on the grounds that the
      president was not a "judiciary to interpret the Constitution for himself" and so
      was required to abide by and enforce all laws, even those with which he
      disagreed ("Impeachment: Mr. Bingham's Closing Argument for the Prosecution,"
      <em>New York Times</em>, May 5, 1868, 1; Richard L. Aynes,
      "Bingham, John Armor," <em>American National Biography
         Online</em>).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00543_n11">12. Amos Bronson Alcott
      (1799–1888) was an American educator and abolitionist and the father of
      Louisa May Alcott (1832–1888), whose 1868 novel <em>Little
         Women</em> (loosely based on the Alcott home) secured the financial
      stability that her father had been unable to achieve through his own work as a
      teacher and transcendentalist. See Odell Shepard, ed., <em>The
         Journals of Bronson Alcott</em> (Boston: Little, Brown, 1938),
      286–90.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00543_n5">13. Walt Whitman had forwarded
      to Amos Bronson Alcott a copy of "Personalism" (<em>Galaxy</em>
      [May 1868], 540–547), and Walt had informed his mother of Alcott's
      appreciation for the essay in his  letter. Ralph Waldo Emerson's enthusiastic response to Whitman
      after the publication of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led Alcott and
      Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) to visit the Whitman home in Brooklyn on
      November 9, 1856. Walt was not home. Alcott in his journal described Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman as "a stately sensible matron believing in Walter absolutely and
      telling us how good he was and wise as a boy" (Odell Shepard, ed., <em>The Journals of Bronson Alcott</em> [Boston: Little, Brown,
      1938], 289).<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00518_n3">14. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. The
      connection between Lane and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, who had served
      under Lane before accepting the position of Chief Engineer at the St. Louis
      Water Works, led to George Washington Whitman's employment as a pipe inspector
      in Brooklyn. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in her  letter reported Jeff Whitman's confidence that George's
      connection to Lane offered assurance of stable employment. George's position
      with the Brooklyn Water Works became more tenuous in 1869 after the
      reorganization of the Brooklyn Board of Water Commissioners in April: Lane
      resigned after the new board was seated (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman). Lane later designed and
      constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city engineer, and he
      again employed George to inspect pipe in Camden, New Jersey ("Moses Lane," <em>Proceedings of the American Society of Civil Engineers</em>
      [February 1882], 58).<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00543_n6">15. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      disbelief is understandable since Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's salary far
      exceeded the earnings of Walt Whitman and his brother George Washington Whitman,
      but it is unlikely to be a mistake. The raise that Moses Lane reported would be
      substantial, an increase of about fifty percent over Jeff's initial salary of
      "three hundred thirty dollars per month" (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price,
      ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson
         Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984], 119).<a href="#r15">[back]
