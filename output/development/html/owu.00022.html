      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman
      <br></br>Dear Friend 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>When I left you I went straight to the prison and gave that book to Rush<sup><a href="#owu.00022_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> in his cell
      with your respects, and how the poor fellow's eyes shone out with joy for your
      remembrance of him in prison. He says his spirit will be in your back yard in Camden
      all the time he will be reading it. His mind is well occupied in his cell as he has
      a good many scientific books to read. I had given him when there before a copy of
      Jean Paul Richter<sup><a href="#n4292" id="r2">2</a></sup> and he was delighted beyond measure in reading it and he thought
      Germany could hardly prouce such a great mind.
   </p>
   
   <p>Wm Cooper of this city (the free thinker, that I took over to see you some years ago)
      sent to the country for me to come as he was near the end with lung trouble, he
      wanted me to lay him quietly away with the least trouble and expense possible and
      no
      priest to come near him and he would like to be cremated, so I found the President
      of that Society and made all the arrangements and returned and told him all about
      it
      which pleased him very much, he put his arms around my neck in a fatherly way, and
      said he would now die in peace and thought he would not last till morning this was
      friday night, he passed away the next morning saturday at ½ past 6 without a
      struggle, his mind was as clear as it was 20 years ago when I first heard him
      lecturing on Darwin's<sup><a href="#n4293" id="r3">3</a></sup> theory. Twenty four hours after his death the retort fires
      were started on Sunday morning and at 4 in the afternoon the oven was at white heat.
      2800 degrees all ready and he was put in a white sheet which was soaked in alum and
      laid  on a sheet
      of thin iron, the centre of it about 6 inches lower than the edges, and this was
      suspended on a scienfitic machine which had a long rod in front of it something like
      a fishing pole and the iron pan was suspended from this rod, and then it was moved
      or wheeled into another room and when it got close to the wall an oven door opened
      and in went the rod and pan with my friend Cooper, no hands touched it, no fizzing
      or blaze, no smell or smoke of any kind whatever, the rod came out of itself, and
      left the pan behind, the door closed without noise and every thing was as quiet and
      orderly as a Quaker Meeting, nothing to jar or hurt the feelings of any one, the
      most perfect work I ever saw. Thanks to science for doing such good, clean, fine,
      work. There is a small aperture of glass about two inches round to look into this
      oven so that you can see the process of what is going on inside. As the gasses from
      the body arise they are conveyed down into a furnace underneath the oven and all the
      gasses are burned as fast as made nothing whatever to go up the chimney no smell
      inside or outside the building. it was a new experience for me, as I looked through
      the little glass door and saw my friend vanishing away like a snow flake before my
      eyes. that thought then as well as now crowded into my brain when I looked on him
      
      whom I had known for 20 years, a man that had read all about the Religion and
      Philosophy of India, China, Egypt, Greece, Rome and Europe and how often we had
      talked over these people and their Philosophy, and I standing outside that oven was
      left to think, had his thinking come to an end before my eyes there. What a selfish
      race we are, how we fight with law as well as no law to grasp and accumulate and
      steal  of the
      poor all for what. The millionaire, beggar, priest, lawyer doctor and philosopher
      all have to come to this as soon as the doctor says that that is the last breath he
      has to breathe and he then can be removed legally into a hot oven and in 2 hours
      nothing is left of him except 5 lbs of bone dust which I pay 2 cts a lb for, to
      enrich my farm. so man after all his knowledge and boasting of the millions that he
      owns is just worth 10 cents what a self conceited thing man is, and it was well said
      of old, Earth to Earth, ashes to ashes, and dust to dust.
   </p>
   
   <p>These are part of what thoughts were crowding in my brain as I stood watching for
      one
      hour till my friend Cooper vanished away before my eyes. so I felt I must tell you
      that there is a new Crematory built in Philadelphia between Germantown and Chestnut
      Hill and they have 30 acres of land round the Building which cost them $75,000 to
      put up, and it is the finest one in the world. my friend Cooper was 66 years old,
      and he was the Sixth person that had been cremated there and the cost is $50. I did
      all he wished me to do in this matter and I know well he would have been pleased to
      know that his remains were returned so quickly to the elements from whence they came.

   <p>Just write me if able or send me one word, say better or worse</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Ingram, a Quaker, kept a tea
      store—William Ingram and Son Tea Dealers–in Philadelphia. Of Ingram,
      Whitman observed to Horace Traubel: "He is a man of the Thomas Paine
      stripe—full of benevolent impulses, of radicalism, of the desire to
      alleviate the sufferings of the world—especially the sufferings of
      prisoners in jails, who are his protégés" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.53.html">Sunday, May 20, 1888</a>).
