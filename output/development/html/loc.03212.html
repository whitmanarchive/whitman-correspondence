      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Do your remember how I visited you in Camden one day last June? Perhaps you will remember
      me by the bouquet of ferns and
      larkspurs. Now I am out here, and circumstances contrary to my wishes, will keep me
      here indefinitely.
   </p>
   
   <p>This is one of my homesick days, and I have been thinking over what there is in the
      north that I would so much like to see, and hear,  and among other things I think how
      much I would like to see you again, and hear you say, as you did before, "I'm glad
      you came!" I often think about you, and you have written so many lines for me that
      I
      wish to say a word back.
   </p>
   
   <p>When I read I say "Yes, I am she, O you wise poet," and sometimes I think I must
      put out my hand for you; and I am sure that we have gone together down that brown
      road a great many times; and perhaps it was my pulse that you heard, like "little
      tinkling bells."<sup><a href="#loc.03212_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am very glad my eyes found the message you hid away for me—hid so deeply,
      though, that I barely found it, and at first doubted if there was a message there,
      or if it was for me.
   </p>
   
   <p>I love you very much, and feel toward you, as toward all strong and true people, a
      sense of obligation.
   </p> 
   
   <p>In glad acknowledgement of your companionship, and hoping for you all good things,</p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Your friend,
      <br></br>Eleanor M. Lawney.
