   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00545_n13">1. This letter dates to June
      25, 1868. "June 25" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard Maurice
      Bucke dated the letter to the year 1868. Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver
      also assigned the date June 25, 1868 (<em>Faint Clews &amp;
         Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North
      Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 196–198), and Edwin Haviland
      Miller agreed (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:366). The year 1868 is
      consistent with Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman living in St. Louis, with the prospect of placing the children of Nancy
      McClure in an orphan asylum, and with the initial progress on a house that
      George Washington Whitman was building for his mother. This letter follows
      Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman, in
      which she asked him to write to James Cornwell about removing Nancy's
      children.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00545_n1">2. According to Clara
      Barrus, John Burroughs (1837–1921) visited Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      in Brooklyn in late June (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:37, n. 10). However, Walt Whitman also
      wrote on  that John
      Burroughs "may call upon you on his way home." If Walt Whitman informed his
      mother in a June letter that Burroughs might visit, that letter is not
      extant, but more than one visit by Burroughs, who traveled regularly, is
      also reasonable.<br><br>
      Burroughs met Walt Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864, and
      Whitman in 1864 commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs wrote several books involving or devoted to Whitman's
      work: <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Notes
         on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</em> (1867), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). Ursula North (1836–1917) married John
      Burroughs in 1857 and also became a friend to Walt Whitman. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the Burroughs family, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John (1837–1921) and Ursula

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">3. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00545_n2">5. For Mattie's June 8, 1868
      letter, probably the most recent letter that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had
      received, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of
         Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      54–56.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">6. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00545_n10">7. Jane McClure was the
      sister-in-law of Nancy McClure, the widow of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son
      Andrew Jackson Whitman (d. 1863). Jane was married to Nancy's brother Edward
      McClure, a janitor in the Brooklyn courthouse. For the identification of McClure
      as Nancy's maiden name, see Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975), n. 32.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00545_n11">8. Nancy McClure Whitman was
      the wife of Walt Whitman's brother, Andrew Jackson Whitman. James "Jimmy" and
      George "Georgy" were Nancy and Andrew's sons, and Nancy was pregnant with
      Andrew, Jr., when her husband died in December 1863. For the identification of
      McClure as Nancy's maiden name (Louisa Whitman also writes "maguire" or
      "maquire") and Andrew's wife and children, see Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>

      32; 13–14.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00545_n12">9. The man "cornell" is James
      H. Cornwell, a friend of Andrew Jackson Whitman, who secured him a job in North
      Carolina in 1863 building fortifications. After being discharged from the Union
      Army in December of 1864, Cornwell returned to his position as a judge in the
      Brooklyn City Hall. He is mentioned in Whitman's "Scenes in a Police Justices'
      Court Room" <em>Brooklyn Daily Times</em> (September 9, 1857). For
      more on the relationship between Andrew and Cornwell, see Martin G. Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>

   <p id="duk.00545_n17">11. The Brooklyn Home for
      Destitute Children was inaugurated in 1862. It was located on Baltic Avenue near
      Flatbush. It accepted infants and male children up to the age of nine years old.
      For a description of the facility and its purpose at its founding, see "The Home

      The cellar was probably for the house in the lot on 1149 Atlantic Avenue.
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman followed up on George Washington Whitman's
      difficulty in locating a surveyor and with his progress on the cellar in her
       letter to Walt Whitman.
      George purchased the property outright from his partner—a man named
      Smith—and Louisa and son Edward moved there in late September (see her
       letter to Walt and Walt's
       letter to Peter
      Doyle).<br><br>
      George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until
      the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of
      Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of
      Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn
      and began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and
      later a mason named French. George eventually took up a position as
      inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on George,
