   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07743_n1">1. Since the note refers to
      Whitman's two recently published books, it seems logical to assign it to 1889
      [for further clarification of the assigned date, see the second note below].
      According to Edwin Haviland Miller's tabulation, based upon his letters and his entries
      in <em>The Commonplace-Book</em>, the poet's income in 1889 amounted
      to at least $1,447.91: royalties, $626.47; sales of books, $245.89; payments for
      articles and poems, $95.00; and gifts, $480.55. (The figures on book sales are
      necessarily to some extent conjectural, since I have had to assume that he
      charged uniform prices for his various books.) The entries in <em>The Commonplace-Book</em> in 1889, like those in 1888, are not complete, as
      discrepancies between amounts deposited in the bank and notations of receipts of
      money are commonplace (<em>The Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07743_n2">2. Whitman is requesting a copy
      of one of McKay's printings of the sixth (1881) edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, with the "annex" "Sands at Seventy." Because this
      letter is undated, it could be argued that the poet was asking for the 1884
      issue of the 1881 edition (the first issue published by McKay). However, he is
      more likely asking for the 1888 issue, which dates the letter closer to 1889.
      The postscript reference to the "pocket-b'k copy" Whitman gave to McKay with the
      letter makes the year certain and eliminates the months January through May. The
      poet had the special pocket-book edition printed in honor of his 70th birthday,
      on May 31, 1889. See Whitman's
       letter to Frederick Oldach.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00869_n3">3. Whitman had a limited pocket-book edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      printed in honor of his 70th birthday, on May 31, 1889, through special
      arrangement with Frederick Oldach. Only 300 copies were printed, and Whitman
      signed the title page of each one. The volume also included the annex <em>Sands at Seventy</em> and his essay <em>A
         Backward Glance O'er Traveled Roads</em>. See Whitman's , letter to Oldach. For more
      information on the book see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
