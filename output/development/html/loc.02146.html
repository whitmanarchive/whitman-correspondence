   </p>
   
   
   <p>On coming back here, I find your letter of the 20th. It is so kind (bringing up old
      memories, &amp; making prologue 
      &amp; ceremony unnecessary) that I will at once answer it in its own spirit, &amp; reveal
      the situation.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My paralysis has left me permanently disabled, unable to do any thing of any consequence,
      and yet with perhaps 
      (though old, not yet 60) some lease of life yet. I had saved up a little money, &amp;
      when I came here, nearly three 
      years ago, I bought a nice cheap lot, intending to put on a small house to haul in,
      &amp; live out the rest of my days.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had, &amp; yet have I have a sort of idea that my books, (I am getting ready, or about
      have ready, my completed writings, 
      in two Volumes—<u>Leaves of Grass</u>, and <u>Two Rivulets</u>) 
      will henceforth furnish me reliably with sufficient for grub, 
      pocket money, &amp;c., if I have my own shanty to live in.<sup><a href="#loc.02146_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>            
   
   
   <p>        
      But my means, meagre at the best, have gone for my expenses since, 
      &amp; now, while not hitherto actually wanting, (&amp; not worrying much about the future
      either,) I have come to the end of my rope, 
      &amp; am in fact ridiculously poor.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>
      I have my lot yet clear, &amp; it would be a great thing for me to be able to
      
      build forthwith a four or five 
      room shanty on it &amp; haul in, snug &amp; quiet, with the sense of security—for the rest
      of my days—for I feel yet about as cheerful 
      &amp; <u>vimmy</u> as ever, &amp; may live several years yet,—indeed probably will—&amp; 
      may write some—though my days of active participation, &amp; ganging about in the world,
      are over.<sup><a href="#loc.02146_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I get out a little nearly every day, &amp; enjoy it, but am very lame—Keep stout &amp; red
      as ever—grayer than ever—am feeling pretty comfortable as I write—have just returned
      from a three weeks jaunt to Washington and Baltimore—which has much refreshed me,
      (the first time I have been away from my anchorage here for nearly three years.) 
      I often recall the old times in New York, or on Broadway, or at Pfaff's—&amp; the faces
      &amp; voices of <u>the boys</u>.—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edwin Einstein, a
      tobacconist and a friend from the Pfaffian days of the 1850s, wrote to Whitman
      on , from the Union League Club,
      Madison Avenue and Twenty-sixth Street, New York: "I would not trouble you with
      this letter, were it not that I saw mentioned in the N. Y. Sun the other day the
      fact that you were in very needy circumstances, if that is so will you let me
      know, and myself and a few other of your old friends would be glad to aid you to
      the best of our ability. If it is not so, (which I sincerely trust may be the
      case) pardon the liberty I am taking and believe it is only done out of
      friendship and good will" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02146_n4">1. This draft letter was
      written on the backs of a series of letters to Whitman, pasted together to form
      a long sheet.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02146_n3">2. This paragraph was written
      in pencil on a separate piece of paper. Whitman noted the intended placement in
      the letter with an insertion mark.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02146_n2">3. Probably the repetitions
      in this draft were eliminated in the version that was sent. As evidenced by the
      number of stricken passages, Whitman had difficulty in finding the exact words
      to describe his lot.<a href="#r3">[back]
