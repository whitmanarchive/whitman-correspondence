      <br></br><br></br></span><span>Dear Hank
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am here seeing to the setting up &amp; stereotyping of my book in a big printing
      office, (Rand &amp; Avery.)<sup><a href="#loc.04003_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Every thing goes
      satisfactory enough, so far. I suppose you 
      rec'd
      
       the paper (or papers?) I sent—they will give you some 
      acc't
      
       of two or three little happenings in my jaunt—I was down on Long
      Island at the spot where I was born &amp; where I had spent my summers in youth from
      time to time—went around to all the old places I hadn't seen before for 40
      years—seems to me now the most beautiful region on earth—Dr Bucke was
      with me &amp; he thought so too—Before I went there, I was at Rockaway (L I) &amp; at Long Branch (N J)—The last two weeks I have been in N Y
      City—So you see I have been the rounds—I am pretty well—&amp; have
      been so—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I shall probably stay here a month or more—Dear boy I wish you would write to
      me a good long letter &amp; tell me all the news, especially about yourself. Direct
      to me <u>care of Osgood &amp; Co: 211 Tremont Street, Boston, 
         Mass:</u> and I shall get it. I have not been much about Boston this
      time, but it is a lively place to be in—the streets all crumpled up, short,
      and more corners &amp; angles than any thing else, but clean &amp;
      handsome—this forenoon I have been some time on <u>the
         Common</u> (an old Park of 60 or 70 acres right in the midst of the city with
      lots of fine very old trees)—I am now writing this in Osgood's place in Boston
      (they are the publishers of my book)—How are you &amp; all getting along?—I wish you to
      give my love to your father &amp; mother—Debbie &amp; Jo Ed,
      Mont, &amp; Van—Ruth &amp; little George—&amp; tell them I remember the
      good times I have had, past summers—&amp; show this letter to them, if they
      wish—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is now nearly 1, &amp; I must go off to my dinner—God bless you dear boy
      &amp; farewell for this time—I shall write again before long—
   </p>
