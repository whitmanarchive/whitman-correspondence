      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Twice I have written to you before,—and whether my letters have ever reached
      you, or whether you have had other nobler &amp; more important thing to prevent your
      attending to mere secondary matters, or—whatever the reason may be—(and
      indeed I know how many reasons, remembering too that you have been ill this summer,
      there are for it). I have waited very  anxiously for a reply so far in
      vain. You know this anxiety,—of a young man, in the first hard fight of life
      &amp; poetry in a great careless town, rebuffed over &amp; over, coming almost every
      day—to all appearance otherwise—to his last penny. Not that I wish to
      pretend to any great misery—for perhaps there never was a happier life than
      mine, in most ways—; but disclosing my present standpoint, at odds with the
      fortunate ordinary aspects, you may be more ready to give me your helping hand of
      comradeship &amp; cheer. 
   </p>
   
   <p> The exact nature of the help you can give is this,—(as perhaps I ought to
      assume you know already, unless my former letters have not reached you)—the  giving
      permission for a new &amp; cheap edition of <u>Leaves of
         Grass</u> in England. The conditions of the Series of poets in which it is
      proposed to include your name are not altogether satisfactory may be; certain
      details are rather out of keeping with the tremendous scheme &amp; infinite scope of
      the Leaves of Grass. But at the same time there are advantages in such an
      association which can not be overlooked, as for instance the immediately extended
      audience which is obtained by the appearance in a popular series of this sort. The
      more incompatible features of the edition, —such as red-line borders,
      prettified cover &amp; so on, we must insist on having done away with in the case
      of the Leaves of Grass volume; and indeed I think if you strongly expressed your
      disapproval of the general conditions of the series, at the same  time not
      objecting to the most urgent part of the request—for a cheap edition simply
      that is—I think the publishers would be persuaded to issue the volume
      specially &amp; by itself, as a small square volume with plain cover &amp; simply
      the emblem of a tuft of grass, and this would be a size &amp; shape which could be
      easily carried about anywhere in the pocket. (My own copy of <u>Leaves of Grass</u> [Philadelphia, 1883 
      edit'n
      
      ] I have taken to pieces &amp; carry the different parts as I may want them
      about in a little parchment wallet; for the whole book is too big to be conveniently
      pocketed.) The publishers have asked me to forward you as a proof of their
      honourable intention ten guineas, and I am sure if the edition proved successful
      they would readily repeat  the remittance. Last week I saw William Rossetti,<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; he advised
      me to send the amount through the Post Office, which I will do accordingly early1
      next week. 
   </p>
   
   <p> William Rossetti said he thought the proposed 
      editn
      
       very desirable, and was altogether so kind that I felt a good deal cheered
      (though we only had a moment or two's talk) &amp; determined to consult him again as
      the arrangements progressed. Last Sunday as a further step I lectured on <u>Leaves of Grass</u>, as you will see by the bill enclosed, in
      Islington, north London, &amp; thanks to my subject, the adventure was successful,
      &amp; I have been asked to redeliver the lecture in two other places. We had been
      threatened beforehand with a fierce opposition, but to our surprise it utterly
      collapsed after the lecture, &amp; one lady present  spoke with enthusiasm on the right
      side. For my own part I can't tell you with what elation &amp; pride I recited some
      or the noblest passages in Leaves of Grass—firing them off as it were into the
      enemy's camp like the rifles Ruskin<sup><a href="#n3013" id="r2">2</a></sup> calls them. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
      <u>29th Sept:</u>—This is my
      chief claim to be your interpreter at all in England then—that I stand with
      the band of young men who have the future in their hands, young men of the people,
      not academics; not mere University students, but a healthy, determined, hearty band
      of comrades, seeking amid all their errors &amp; foolishnesses to help the average,
      everyday men about them. You could have a thousand writers of more culture &amp;
      literary student faculty than mine, but none I think with more love &amp; enthusiasm
      &amp; heat of youth. So far my accomplishments in life &amp; song  has not been
      much, having struggled through endless phases of literary tradition, being too
      occupied with the mining of coal &amp; the living of a free open-air country life in
      the North. But give me your word, and I will try not to be unworthy of it. 
   </p>
   
   <p> There is a temptation to say more about myself in the past &amp; present, but
      perhaps it's better not to, especially as before long I may be able to send you a
      book,—"The Book of Browney Valley," (Browney being the name of the little
      river by which I lived for some years,) which will tell what is to be told at
      length. Now, on the banks of the Thames, whose current, &amp; craft of all
      kinds—sailing, steaming, rowing—, are fresh every morning to this attic
      window. I gather with tremendous zest materials for a larger volume,—The Book
      of Thames Valley, which will owe to <u>Leave of Grass</u> more
      than I can well say. 
   </p>  
   
   
   
   
   <p> Ah, I often wonder what your days are like in Camden,—how the sun shines, how
      the winds visit you,—wonder too whether you would mind if one day yet another
      young messenger came with some English leaves of grass in his hand for a token to
      your door. Only before that there's a great deal I must do, for tonight remembering
      that admonitant voice in <u>Calamus</u><sup><a href="#n4128" id="r3">3</a></sup>. I seem a very poor &amp;
      weak &amp; inefficient follower. But "Therefore release me &amp; depart on your
      way," as ominously runs the last line I will not! 
   </p>
   
   <p> I shall wait very eagerly for some word from you; with great love (in which William
      Rossetti asked to be included) from this London nook of the world, 
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0522">1. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3013">2. John Ruskin (1819–1900) was
      one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
      via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
      of ). Ruskin, according to Whitman,
      expressed "<em>worry</em> [...] that [<em>Leaves</em> is] <em>too personal</em>, too emotional,
      launched from the fires of [...] spinal passions, joys, yearnings" (see the
      letter from Whitman to William O'Connor of ). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my
      Ruskin with some qualifications." Still, Ruskin "is not to be made little of: is
      of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.4.html">Thursday, January 24, 1889</a>).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n4128">3. Rhys is referring to the final
      lines of the third poem in Whitman's "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/LG/1860/clusters/76.html">Calamus</a>" cluster. "Calmaus" was first published in the 1860 edition
      of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
