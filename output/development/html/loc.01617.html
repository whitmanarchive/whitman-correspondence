      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Tennyson writes to you by this mail
      he lays upon me the blame of not having written to you sooner, &amp;
      I am willing to bear it
      the fact is the books went to his London
      address &amp; were not forwarded.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Cyril Flower (1843–1907) was an English
      barrister and a friend of Tennyson; see Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt
         Whitman in England</em> (1934), 128–129. According to the February 20,
      1886 <em>Solicitor's Journal</em>, Flower was appointed a Lord of
      the Treasury; Flower served as a member of Parliament from 1880 to 1892, when he
      was given the title Baron Battersea (see the London <em>Gazette</em> (6 September 1892), 5090). According to Flower's  letter, he met Whitman in Washington
      in December, 1870. He had later delivered some of Whitman's books to Tennyson,
      who "was much touched by your memory of him, and I told him of your deep regard
      for him." On , Flower informed
      Whitman that Tennyson was sending a letter by the same mail (Tennyson's letter
      was dated ). Flower wrote again on
      : "When I read you or think of
      you . . . I feel that I hold in my hand clasped strong &amp; tight &amp; for
      security the great hand of a friend, a simple good fellow, a man who loves me
      &amp; who is beautiful because he loves, &amp; with the consciousness of that I
      feel never alone—never sad."
