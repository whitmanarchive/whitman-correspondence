      (probably) 160 to 200 pages<sup><a href="#loc.07520_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—may-be somewhat
      less—long primer—exactly same sized page as the "Specimen Days" you
      printed of mine six years ago—

   <p>Can you &amp; would you like to do it for me?—<u>Have you some
         good long primer</u>? The copy is ready—it is all printed
      matter—(or nearly all)—is all plain sailing—you could commence
      next Monday—Sh'd want liberal proofs—

   <p>You can talk with Horace Traubel just the same as you w'd with me—I am almost
      entirely disabled ab't walking, or bodily locomotion—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Whitman had intended to have Mr.
      Bennerman, a Philadelphia proprietor, print <em>November

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
