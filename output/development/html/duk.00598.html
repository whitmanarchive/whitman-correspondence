   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00598_n8">1. The most probable date for
      this letter is July 14, 1869. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to 1870,
      but Edwin Haviland Miller dated it to 1869 (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:367). Bucke's reason for dating the letter to 1870 is unclear, but Walt
      Whitman returned to Brooklyn for his vacation in July 1870. It is unlikely, were
      the letter to date 1870, that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman would omit mention of
      Walt's expected arrival within less than two weeks. Miller's year 1869 is
      believed correct, and numerous factors support this date, though most are
      indirect. The letter states that granddaughter Manahatta "Hattie" Whitman is
      "only [9?] years old." Though the number is at best semi-legible, Hattie was 9
      years old in July 1869. Another indirect reason to prefer the year 1869 is Helen
      Price's statement that her mother Abby Price has written to Walt and hopes that
      he will respond. Walt wrote Abby Price on  to thank Helen for visiting his mother, prompted perhaps by this
      letter or by Abby Price's. Louisa had anticipated a visit by the Prices earlier
      in July (see her  letter to
      Walt). Miller proposed that Walt's letter to Abby Price was prompted by this
      letter, but Walt did not respond to news about Emily "Emma" Price's marriage
      (<em>Correspondence</em>, 2:83, n. 31), which is an odd
      complication. Emily Price married Edward M. Law, an engraver, in 1869. Louisa
      writes of the expected date of marriage only that she "beleive[s] they think," a
      phrase that suggests uncertainty. That is a peculiar statement in July 1869
      because Emily Price—according to another letter—married in late
      April or early May 1869. Just after a visit by Helen Price (Emily's sister),
      Louisa wrote to Walt that Emily "married about two or three weeks ago" (see
      Louisa's  letter to Walt). That letter
      of course conflicts with this letter's month July: the date of Emily Price's
      marriage is an awkward complication, which may suggest confusion on Louisa's
      part or an effort by the Prices to be ambiguous about Emily's marriage
      date—or that this letter is not dated correctly. Despite that
      complication, many factors support summer 1869 for this letter. The width of the
      paper in this letter is consistent with Louisa's  letter to Walt, which does mention the expected
      visit by the Prices. On the basis of the Price visit, Emily Price's marriage,
      granddaughter Hattie's age, and Walt's  letter to Abby Price, this letters most likely dates to July 14,
      1869.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00598_n15">2. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman. Edward attended Henry Ward Beecher's
      Plymouth Church. Beecher, Congregational clergyman and brother of Harriet
      Beecher Stowe, accepted the pastorate of Brooklyn's Plymouth Church in
      1847.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00551_n2">3. Helen "Ellen" Price was the
      daughter of Edmund and Abby Price, whom Walt Whitman and his mother had known
      since the Prices moved to Brooklyn in 1856. During the 1860s, Abby Price and her
      family, especially her daughter Helen, were friends with Walt and Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman. The Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's
      reminiscences of Whitman are included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she
      printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother ("Letters of
      Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's
         Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00598_n4">4. The exact date of Emily
      Price's marriage is not known: Louisa Van Velsor Whitman does not state a firm
      date because she prefaces her claim: "i beleive [<em>sic</em>]
      they think." According to Louisa's 
      letter to Walt Whitman, Emily was expected to marry a man named Law, an "artist
      in the cheap picture line." Emily Price married Edward Law (1844?–), whose
      occupation is listed as engraver in the 1880 census (see <em>United States Census. 1880.</em> New York. Brooklyn, Kings.).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00598_n5">5. The spelling "ellen" is
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's alternate spelling of Helen. Abby Price's
      (1814–1878) business involved the attachment of ruffles, a process for
      which her partner, the inventor George B. Arnold, had developed a sewing machine
      attachment (see Sherry L. Ceniza, "Walt Whitman and Abby Price," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 7:2 [Fall 1989],
      50–51, 63, n. 7). Abby Price had offered Walt $1000 to lobby Thomas
      Harland, the chief clerk in the Patent Office, to have her ruffles exempted from
      the list of articles subject to a tax assessment because the materials used to
      make the ruffles were already taxed (see Abby Price's  letter to Walt Whitman). Also see Ceniza, <em>Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers</em>
      (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1998), 54, 94, 208, n. 16.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n3">6. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00598_n7">7. Charles Williams Kingsley
      (1833–1885) was a contractor for the Brooklyn Water Works.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">8. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="duk.00598_n13">9. Walt Whitman's letter is
      not extant. Numerous photographs of Whitman were taken between the years 1868
      and 1870 (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/gallery.html">Gallery of
         Images</a>").<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="duk.00598_n11">10. Manahatta Whitman
      (1860–1886), known as "Hattie," was the daughter of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. If this letter dates to July 1869, Hattie is 9 years old, and her
      sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957), known as "Sis," is 6 years old.<a href="#r10">[back]
