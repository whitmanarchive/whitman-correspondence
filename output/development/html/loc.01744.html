      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing new or different with me—I am no better in any respect—don't know
      what is going to come out of it all—We are having pretty hot weather 
      here just now, but it does not affect me much—it is not near as oppressive here 
      as the Washington heat—I rec'd your letter my dear son—with the paper—I will write
      more to-morrow—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Wednesday afternoon.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete I have little to write to you about, as I remain anchored here in the house nearly
      
      all the time. As I write I am sitting in my mother's former room, in her old arm chair—Spend
      a great deal of my time here, as I haven't felt like going out lately—half a block
      tires me. Pete, my darling son, I still think I shall weather it, but time only can
      show—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Mother's death is on my mind yet—time does not lift the cloud from me at all
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I want much to get to the sea-shore, either Long Island or the Jersey coast, 
      &amp; shall make a start if I get strong enough—It is not so hot here to-day.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      So long my darling boy.
      <br></br>Walt.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
