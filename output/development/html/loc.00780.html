      <br></br><br></br>Dear Hugo,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.00780_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I rec'd a letter from Bloom yesterday—but, before responding to it (which I will do
      soon) I must write to you, my friend. Your good letter of June 27th was duly rec'd—I
      have read it many times—indeed, Hugo, you know not how much comfort you give, by writing
      me your letters—posting me up.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Well, Hugo, I am still as much as ever, indeed more, in the great military hospitals
      here. Every day or night I spend four, five, or six hours, among my sick, wounded,
      prostrate boys. It is fascinating, sad, &amp; with varied fortune of course. Some of my
      boys get well, some die. After I finish this letter (and then dining at a restaurant),
      I shall give the latter part of the afternoon &amp; some hours of the night to Armory
      Square Hospital, a large establishment &amp; one I find most calling on my sympathies
      &amp; ministrations. I am welcomed by the surgeons as by the soldiers—very grateful to
      me. You must remember that these government hospitals are not filled as with human
      debris like the old established city hospitals, New York, &amp;c., but mostly [with] these
      good-born American young men, appealing to me most profoundly, good stock, often mere
      boys, full of sweetness &amp; heroism—often they seem very near to me, even as my own
      children or younger brothers. I make no bones of petting them just as if they were—have
      long given up formalities &amp; reserves in my treatment of them.
   </p>
   
   <p>Let me see, Hugo. I will not write any thing about the topics of the horrible riots
      of last week,<sup><a href="#loc.00780_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> nor Gen. Meade, nor Vicksburgh, nor Charleston—I leave them to the newspapers. Nor will I write you this time so much about hospitals as I did last. Tell Fred his
      letter was received—I appreciate it, received real pleasure from it—'twas a true friend's
      letter, characteristic, full of vivacity, off hand, &amp; below all a thorough base of
      genuine remembrance &amp; good will—was not wanting in the <em>sentimental</em> either—(so I take back all about the <em>apostate</em>, do you understand, Freddy, my dear?)—&amp; only write this for you till I reply to that
      said letter a good long (especial) missive to yourself.
   </p>
   
   <p>I<sup><a href="#loc.00780_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup> meant to [tell] Nat Bloom that if he expects to provoke me into a dignified not mentioning
      him, nor writing any thing about him, by his studious course of heart-breaking neglect,
      (which has already reduced me to a skeleton of but little over 200 lbs &amp; a countenance
      of raging hectic, indicating an early grave), I was determined not to do any thing
      of the sort, but shall speak of him every time, &amp; send him my love, just as if he were adorned with faithful troth instead
      of (as I understand) beautiful whiskers—Does he think that beautiful whiskers can
      fend off the pangs of remorse? In conclusion I have to say, Nathaniel, you just keep
      on if you think there's no hell.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Hugo, I suppose you were at Charles Chauncey's<sup><a href="#loc.00780_n6" id="r4">4</a></sup> funeral—tell me all you hear about the particulars of his death—Tell me of course
      all about the boys, what you do, say, any thing, every thing<sup><a href="#loc.00780_n7" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Hugo, write oftener—you express your thoughts perfectly—do you not know how much more
      agreeable to me is the conversation or writing that does not take hard paved tracks,
      the usual &amp; stereotyped, but has little peculiarities &amp; even kinks of its own, making
      its genuineness—its vitality? Dear friend, your letters are precious to me—none I
      have received from any one are more so.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Ah, I see in your letter, Hugo, you speak of my being reformed—no, I am not so frightfully
      reformed either, only the hot weather here does not admit of drinking heavy drinks,
      &amp; there is no good lager here—then besides I have no society—I expect to prove to
      you &amp; all yet that I am no backslider—But here I go nowhere for mere amusement, only
      occasionally a walk.
   </p>
   
   <p>And Charles Russell—how I should like to see him—how like to have one of our old times
      again—Ah Fred, and you, dear Hugo, &amp; you repentant one with the dark-shining whiskers<sup><a href="#loc.00780_n8" id="r6">6</a></sup>—must there not be an hour, an evening in the future, when we four returning concentrating
      New York-ward or elsewhere, shall meet, allowing no interloper, &amp; have our drinks
      &amp; things, &amp; resume the chain &amp; consolidate &amp; achieve a night better &amp; mellower than
      ever—we four?
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Hugo, I wish you to give my love to all the boys—I received a letter from Ben Knower,
      very good—I shall answer it soon—Give my love to Ben—If Charles Kingsley<sup><a href="#loc.00780_n9" id="r7">7</a></sup> is in town same to him—ditto Mullen—ditto Perk,<sup><a href="#loc.00780_n10" id="r8">8</a></sup> (I hope to hear that sweet, sweet fiddler one of these days, that strain again.)
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish to have Fred Gray say something from me, giving my love to his mother &amp; father—I
      bear them both in mind—I count on having good interviews with them when I see New
      York.<sup><a href="#loc.00780_n100" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>And Charles Russell—how I should like to see him—how like to have one of our old time
      again—[illegible] Fred, &amp; you dear Hugo, &amp; you repentant one with the dark-shy whiskers—must there
      not be an hour, an even'g in the future when we four returning New York or elsewhere,
      shall meet, allowing no interloper, &amp; have our drink &amp; things &amp; reserve the chain
      &amp; consolidate—&amp; achieve might better &amp; [illegible] than ever, we four?

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00780_n3">1. On December 23, 1888,
      Horace Traubel records that "W. gave me one of what he calls his 'soger boy
      letters'. . . . he even had me read it to him. I don't like to read these
      letters aloud. They move me too much. I notice that he too is stirred strangely
      over them hearing them again" (<em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [Rowman and Littlefield, 1961], 3:367). The New York friends
      mentioned in this letter are discussed briefly in the notes to a letter from
      
      . The envelope with
      this draft was stationery from the United States Christian Commission.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00780_n4">2. If Whitman referred to
      the New York riots of July 15, 1863, the date of this letter may be incorrect.
      There was, however, a draft drawing in Washington on August 3 and 4,
      1863.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00780_n5">3. As Horace Traubel read
      this letter, Whitman said that he did not think that this paragraph had been
      sent: "It was too damned nonsensical for a letter otherwise so dead serious"
      (<em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1961], 3:368). It is
      lined through in the manuscript.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00780_n6">4. See Whitman's letter from
      
      .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00780_n7">5. Whitman deleted the
      following: "did you go out to Bloom's for 4th of July? I heard about your
      bold(?) &amp; aquatic excursion to Bloo[m's]."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00780_n8">6. Nat Bloom.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00780_n9">7. In a notebook, Whitman
      described Kingsley as "a young man, upper class, at Pfaff's &amp;c—fond of
      training for boat-racing &amp;c.—June, July, 1862" (The Library of Congress #8).
      He was listed in the Directory of 1865–1866 as the proprietor of a
      furniture store; his name did not appear thereafter.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00780_n10">8. We have not identified
      Perkins, who was mentioned again in letters from , and 
      .<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>

      Walt Whitman): "To Hugo | Aug 7 '63."<a href="#r9">[back]
