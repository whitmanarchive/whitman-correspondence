   <p> Your letter of August 1st to hand, it was printed in the Athenaeum of Aug 22nd and
      in Daily News of 24th.<sup><a href="#loc.02186_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> A week ago William Rossetti<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r2">2</a></sup> sent off to you ￡21.2.0 and ￡1. sent by
      Aldrich;<sup><a href="#med.00763_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> this latter is in the form of an American Bank
      draft, wh Aldrich said should be
      forwarded to you in that form; I do not know in what form Rossetti has mailed you
      the ￡21.2.0. This then is an 
      instalment
      
       of the money accruing from the scheme. 
   </p>
   
   <p> We have got John Fraser<sup><a href="#loc.02186_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> to print a circular reprinting
      Athenaeum paragraph with a list of names and your letter in facsimile, expect copies
      Monday morning. Will send
      a copy to you. 
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p> William Rossetti and your friends generally were very pleased and glad to get your
      letter (William Rossetti remarking that it was a very nice letter.) I am very glad
      dear Walt that you have one good stout friendly Jersey woman in Mary Davis.<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>
   
   <p> I trust that you will soon resume your rides over to Philadelphia on the boat. I
      have just returned from the country, hence a little delay in getting off this note.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02186_n1">1. See Whitman's letter of . Herbert Gilchrist and William
      Michael Rossetti had been collecting funds in England for the financial support
      of the aged poet. A paragraph in the <em>Athenaeum</em> of July
      11, 1885, read: "A subscription list is being formed in England with a view to
      presenting a free-will offering to the American poet Walt Whitman. The poet is
      in his sixty-seventh year, and has since his enforced retirement some years ago
      from official work in Washington, owing to an attack of paralysis, maintained
      himself precariously by the sale of his works in poetry and prose, and by
      occasional contributions to magazines." <a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">2. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="med.00763_n1">3. Charles Aldrich
      (1828–1908) was an ornithologist, a member of the Iowa House of
      Representatives, an infantry captain in the Civil War, and founder of the Iowa
      Historical Department. He was also an avid autograph collector, especially of
      Whitman's. He was so eager that the poet termed him "a very hungry man...never
      satisfied—is always crying for more and more" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.135.html">Tuesday, August 20, 1889</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
