   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00017_n1">1. William Conant Church
      (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
      York newspapers until he founded the <em>Army and Navy
         Journal</em> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
      he established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. Financial control of
      the <em>Galaxy</em> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
      was absorbed by the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1878. William
      published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
      Francis wrote for the New York <em>Sun</em> the unsigned piece
      "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." See Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the
      <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952),
      332–350; Donald N. Bigelow, <em>William Conant Church
         &amp;</em> "The Army and Navy Journal" (New York: Columbia University Press,
      1952); J. R. Pearson, Jr., "Story of a Magazine: New York's <em>Galaxy</em>, 1866–1878," <em>Bulletin of the New York
         Public Library</em>, 61 (1957), 217–237, 281–302.<a href="#r1">[back]

      Whitman with his  letter to the
      Churches, was never published in the <em>Galaxy</em>. It later
      became "Ethiopia Saluting the Colors"; see Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the
      <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952),
      337. Walt Whitman withdrew the poem in his  letter to Francis P. Church.<a href="#r2">[back]
