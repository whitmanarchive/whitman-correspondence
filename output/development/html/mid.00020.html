      Editors | Republican daily newspaper | Springfield | Mass.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="mid.00020_n2">2. On September 8 Whitman
      sent notices of the publication of <em>Specimen Days</em> to the
      Springfield <em>Republican</em> as well as to the New York <em>Times</em>, the New York <em>Tribune</em>, the
      New York <em>World</em>, and the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.). The <em>Republican</em> printed two columns of excerpts on
      September 10 (<em>Specimen Days</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall [New York:
      New York University Press, 1963], 133–136, 282–283). The <em>World</em> printed a brief announcement on the same date.
      Apparently the <em>Times</em> and the <em>Tribune</em> did not give Whitman's book publicity.<a href="#r2">[back]
