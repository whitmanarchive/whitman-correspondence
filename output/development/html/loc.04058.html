      <br></br><br></br>My Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope you are enjoying this splendid, sunshiny weather as much as we are—the atmosphere
      here is delicious.<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r1">1</a></sup> In the morning Giddy<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r2">2</a></sup> and I set at home busy with needle work, letter writing, and reading. After lunch
      we go out for a walk or to pay visits—and of an evening very often to receptions (but
      they are not half so jolly as our evenings at Philadelphia). Still we have a lively,
      pleasant time. I like Miss Booth<sup><a href="#n3017" id="r3">3</a></sup> very much, with her kindly, generous character and active practical mind. So I do
      Mrs. Croly<sup><a href="#n1507" id="r4">4</a></sup>—she is more impulsive and enthusiastic. Kate Hillard<sup><a href="#n0302" id="r5">5</a></sup> often goes with us, &amp; she is always good company. I had a note from Edward Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r6">6</a></sup> the other day brought by a lady who had been living near him at Sheffield—an American
      lady with two very fine little girls who has lately lost her husband in England and
      was on her way back to her parents' home in Pennsylvania—somewhere beyond Pittsburg. She is one who loves your poems, &amp; has great hopes of seeing you in New York. She
      told me her little girls were so fond of Carpenter he of them—he is first rate with
      children. I hope you will not put off coming to New York till we are returning to
      Philadelphia, which will be some time in May. I find Beatrice<sup><a href="#n0260" id="r7">7</a></sup> is so anxious to get further advantages for study in England or Paris before she
      begins to practise, and Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r8">8</a></sup> is so strongly advised by Mr. Eaton,<sup><a href="#upa.00172_n3" id="r9">9</a></sup> of whose judgment &amp; experience he thinks very highly, to study in Duron's Studio
      in Paris for a year, that I have made up my mind to go back, for a time at any rate,
      this summer; but I shall leave my furniture here, and the question of where our future
      home is to be, open. Herby is making great progress. I wish you could see the head
      of an old woman he has just painted—and I wish he had had as much power when he had
      such splendid chances of painting you. I cannot tell you how vividly and pleasantly
      Chestnut St. on a sunny day rose before me in your jottings. Love from us all. Tell
      your sister I often think of her &amp; shall enjoy a chat ever so.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0259">1. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0890">2. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3017">3. Mary Louise Booth (1831–1889)
      was the first editor of the New York-based <em>Harper's
         Bazaar</em>, one of the first fashion magazines of its time. Booth also
      translated around 40 works of French literature and wrote a history of New York.
      For more on Booth and the <em>Bazaar</em>, see Paula Bernat
      Bennett, "Subtle Subversion: Mary Louise Booth and <em>Harper's
         Bazaar</em> (1867–1889)," in <em>Blue Pencils &amp;
         Hidden Hands: Women Editing Periodicals, 1830–1910</em> (Boston:
      Northeastern University Press, 2004), 225–247.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1507">4. Jane Cunningham Croly
      (1829–1901) was a journalist, and was also the wife of David Goodman
      Croly, who had served as editor of the New York <em>Daily
         Graphic</em>.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0302">5. Katharine Hillard (1839?–1915) was the translator of
      Dante's <em>Banquet</em> (1889) and the editor of <em>An Abridgment by Katharine Hillard of the Secret Doctrine: A
         Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy by Helena Petrovna
         Blavatsky</em> (1907). A Brooklyn resident, she was a friend of Abby Price
      (see Whitman's , letter to
      Price); in fact, according to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter to Helen Price
      on November 26, 1872, the Prices expected that Arthur Price and Katharine
      Hillard would marry (Pierpont Morgan Library). Whitman had known Hillard's
      writings since 1871 and mentioned her in his , letter to Charles Eldridge. He sent her a copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> on July 27, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book). Writing to Whitman on ,
      Moncure D. Conway quoted from a letter sent to him by Katharine Hillard: "I have
      made a discovery since I have been here [in the Adirondacks], and that is, that
      I never half appreciated Walt Whitman's poetry till now, much as I fancied I
      enjoyed it. To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the only
      one who can reach and level their lift, to use his own words, to pass and
      continue beyond" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell
      Kennerley, 1914], 3:112). The first meeting of the poetess with Whitman took
      place on February 28, 1876.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0141b">6. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0260">7. Beatrice Carwardine Gilchrist (1854–1881) was
      the second child (and first daughter) of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist. An
      aspiring physician, Beatrice took the needed preparatory classes but was barred
      (as were all women) from becoming a medical student in England. As a result, she
      attended the Women's Medical College in Philadelphia. She held positions as a
      physician in Berne, Switzerland, and later Edinburgh before committing suicide
      by fatally ingesting hydrocyanic acid in 1881.<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="n0262">8. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <p id="upa.00172_n3">9. Wyatt Eaton
      (1849–1896), an American portrait and figure painter, organized the
      Society of American Artists in 1877. Whitman met Eaton at a reception given by
      Richard W. Gilder on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation," <em>New
         York Tribune</em>, July 4, and <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in
