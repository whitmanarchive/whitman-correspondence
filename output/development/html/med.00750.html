   <p>First thank you again for the handsome money present of some months ago, wh' did me
      more good than you perhaps think for—it has helped me in meals, clothing,
      debts, &amp;c., ever since. My best help however has come in my old age &amp;
      paralysis from the Br: Islands. The piece in yr paper (was it early in May last?)
      from "a distinguished American man of letters" abt me was a very large inflation
      into fiction of a very little amt of fact—in spirit it is altogether, &amp; in
      letter mainly untrue (abt my affairs &amp;c.).<sup><a href="#med.00750_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> My income
      from my books, (royalties &amp;c.) does not reach $100 a year.<sup><a href="#med.00750_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> I am now in my 69th year—living plainly but very
      comfortably in a little wooden cottage of my own, good spirits invariably, but
      physically a sad wreck, failing more and more each successive season, unable even
      to
      get abt the house without help—most of the time though without serious pain or
      suffering, except extreme weakness wh' I have a good deal—the paralysis that
      prostrated me after the Secession war (several shocks) never lifting entirely
      since—but leaving mentality unimpaired absolutely (thank God!) I have a few,
      very few, staunch &amp; loving friends &amp; upholders here in America. I am
      gathering a lot of pieces—uttered within the last six years &amp; shall send
      them out under the name of <em>November Boughs</em> before
      long—a little book (200 pages or less) some new pieces—a sort of
      continuation or supplement. Then I think of printing a revised ed'n of complete
      writings (<em>Leaves of Grass</em>, <em>Specimen Days
         &amp; Collect</em> &amp; <em>November Boughs</em> all in one
      volume) soon. Please accept <em>personal thanks</em> from me (never mind the literary) &amp;
      I know you will accept the impromptu Note in the same spirit in wh' it is written.
      Best thanks and love to all my British helpers, readers &amp; defenders.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Thomas Stead
      (1849–1912) was a well-known English journalist and editor of <em>The Pall Mall Gazette</em> in the 1880s. He was a proponent of
      what he called "government by journalism" and advocated for a strong press that
      would influence public opinion and affect government decision-making. His
      investigative reports were much discussed and often had significant social
      impact. He has sometimes been credited with inventing what came to be called
      "tabloid journalism," since he worked to make newspapers more attractive to
      readers, incorporating maps, illustrations, interviews, and eye-catching
      headlines. He died on the <em>Titanic</em> when it sank in
      1912.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00750_n1">1. Stead had printed
      passages from a "private letter" on May 6, which detailed the American
      supporters of Whitman: George W. Childs, Carnegie, Burroughs. The
      author—perhaps Moncure Conway—asserted that "a rich Philadelphian
      told me today that he had given himself, off and on, a thousand dollars," and
      concluded: "All this talk of the necessity of raising money by subscriptions
      abroad, with the idea that he won't be taken care of at home, is ridiculous";
      see <em>American Literature</em>, 33 (1961), 70. See also

   <p id="med.00750_n3">2. In 1887, Whitman's income
      amounted to at least $2,575.98: royalties, $131.91; lectures,
      $620.00; sales of books, $74.00 (See Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>Walt Whitman: The Correspondence</em> [1886–1889],
