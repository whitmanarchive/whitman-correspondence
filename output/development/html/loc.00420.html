      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother gave me the enclosed letter to send you some days since but I forgot to mail
      it till now. We received your letter<sup><a href="#loc.00420_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> last night. The money from George came all safe &nbsp;I sent you another letter from George
      about last Monday, also sent George a letter with the money in it. Andrew has been
      away in the country but returned yesterday, very much worse.<sup><a href="#loc.00420_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> He came in to see me this morning and it has made me feel quite down-spirited. &nbsp;He
      can neither eat nor drink without the greatest agony. He looks very thin and emaciated.
      I think that if I had the same sickness that I could get the best of it,<sup><a href="#loc.00420_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> but Andrew seems to put his whole faith in thinking that some Dr can give him something
      that will set him all straight. I am going to see the Dr with him this P.M. and I
      also want him to consult Ruggles<sup><a href="#loc.00420_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> if he will. I fear the worst for Andrew. I wish you was on here. I think that your
      advice would be a great thing for him. Cant you come. You speak of coming home. I
      wish you could come just now. Mother is of course much worried about him. Nancy dont seem to amount to much when trouble comes. You would hardly know Andrew. He is thin
      weak and generally sickly looking &nbsp;We have heard nothing from Han lately that I know
      of &nbsp;Mother and Heyde keep writing letters to one another but what about I know not.
      At last the great draft has come and gone and I was not one of the elected. I feel
      thankful &nbsp;In our ward the screws were put rather tight. out of a little over 3000
      names they drew 1056 nearly one in three, while in other wards the proportion was
      1 in 6 and 1 in 7 and in the 9th ward 1 in 10. Tom Geere,<sup><a href="#loc.00420_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Tom McEvoy,<sup><a href="#loc.00420_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> Pat Hughes<sup><a href="#loc.00420_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> two or three in Amermans<sup><a href="#loc.00420_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> house, were all hit. It seems to have avoided the Water Works, only one or two out
      of the whole 40 or 50 employed were hit while in Husted &amp; Carls store<sup><a href="#loc.00420_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> 7 out of 10 were taken. If this is the last of it I feel thankful but I believe Uncle
      Abe left off some on account of Seymour,<sup><a href="#loc.00420_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup> if so I suppose there will be another spurt. However we wont worry till the time
      comes &nbsp;The enclosed $5 is from Mr Moses Lane.<sup><a href="#loc.00420_n12" id="r12">12</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We have what remains of [three?] old Reg. on the hills by our house. They are fine
      looking and well behaved men, and look as if they would do their duty any where. If
      you was home you could have grand times talking with them &nbsp;One Reg. is from Min. one
      from Mich. and one from Ohio. What do you think about coming to Brooklyn &nbsp;I think
      you better, for awhile any way. I wish you would write to Andrew. He seems to feel
      wonderfully cast down &nbsp;Aint the Administrat[ion] got wit enough to see that now is the hour to end the war by
      whipping the rebels. Dont they know enough to know that unless it is ended in 6 months they will have a hard
      time to get men to fill the places of what they have now. I fear not.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00420_n1">1. Dating , and , is a problem. In the first of these Jeff
      incorrectly says that Setember 5 is a Wednesday; actually the fifth was a
      Saturday. One might assume, then, that both letters were written on Wednesday,
      September 2, if it were not for Walt Whitman's comment that he received letters
      from Jeff dated the third (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:143). Perhaps both letters were written on Thursday, September 3, 1863.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00420_n2">2. Walt Whitman to Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman, September 1, 1863 (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, 1:139–41).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00420_n3">3. In her letter to Walt
      Whitman of August 31 (?) Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote: "Andrew has gone to
      place called freehold...he went last monday as far as suffron station" (Trent
      Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special
      Collections Library). Andrew's drinking with Jim Cornwell on this trip
      apparently worsened his health.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00420_n4">4. Jeff was not merely
      making an off-hand statement praising his own will and constitution. To judge
      from scattered references in Hannah's undated letters, Jeff was very sick for a
      short time in the mid-1850s (Heyde, Hannah [Whitman] Collection, Library of
      Congress). While it is impossible to determine the exact nature of Jeff's
      illness, he seems to have suffered from severe depression, loss of appetite, and
      eventually emaciation. Since this was a period of vocational crisis for Jeff,
      the symptoms suggest that his illness was psychosomatic.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00420_n5">5. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his
      practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems"
      (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, 1:90, n. 85).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.00420_n7">7. Two Thomas McEvoys are

      worker in morocco leather who lived on Front Street.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>

   <p id="loc.00420_n9">9. Nicholas Amerman was a
      grocer on Myrtle Avenue. In her letter of May 3 (?), 1860, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman noted that she was "in debt to ammerman about 10 dollars"
      (Trent).<a href="#r9">[back]

      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
