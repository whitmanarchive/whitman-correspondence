   <p>I adapt myself to each case, &amp; to [<em>indecipherable</em>]<sup><a href="#loc.000885_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—some need to be humored, some are rather out of their head—some merely want me to
      sit down [near] them, &amp; hold them by the hand—one will want a letter written to mother
      or father, (yesterd[ay] I wrote over a dozen letters)—some like to have me feed them
      (wounded perhaps in shoulder or wrist) perhaps a few bits of my peaches—some want
      a cooling drink, (I have some very nice syrups from raspberries &amp;c.)—others want writing
      paper, envelopes, a stamp, &amp;c.—I could fill a sheet with one day's items—I often go,
      just at dark, sometimes stay nearly all night—I like to go just before supper, carrying
      a pot or jar of something good &amp; go around with a spoon distributing a little here
      and there. Yet after all this succoring of the stomach (which is of course most welcome
      &amp; indispensable) I should say that I believe my profoundest help to these sick &amp; dying
      men is probably the soothing invigoration I steadily bear in mind, to infuse in them
      through affection, cheering love, &amp; the like, between them &amp; me. It has saved more
      than one life. There is a strange influence here. I have formed attachments here in
      hospital, that I shall keep to my dying day, &amp; they will the same, without doubt.<sup><a href="#loc.000885_n100" id="r2">2</a></sup>
