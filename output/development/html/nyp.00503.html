   <p>Yours 
      rec'd
      
       &amp; welcomed—will write at length soon—(meantime this
      card)—Dr B[ucke]'s book has some sale all the time—nothing vehement, but
      the orders drop in lingeringly<sup><a href="#nyp.00503_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—yesterday ten
      copies from Trübner London, &amp;c. &amp;c. My opinion that the book is <em>a success</em> (in the most important requisites) is to-day
      more decided than ever—<em>largely thanks to you</em>. Dr B has
      been in N. Y. for a month—has been twice here to see me.<sup><a href="#nyp.00503_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Did you see my article in <em>Critic</em>
      of Nov. 24?<sup><a href="#nyp.00503_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I have lately sent a little 20 line poem
      to <em>Harpers</em>—accepted immediately &amp; paid for
      ($50!)<sup><a href="#nyp.00503_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I am well as usual—write
      often—

   <p>I sent your letter to Dr. B—he always wants to hear from you—</p>
