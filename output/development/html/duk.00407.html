   <p>Han<sup><a href="#nyp.00207_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> was speaking about you; a minute ago. She is all the time guessing, wondering
      how Walt is. She recieves all your cards, letters, magazines, books/Antiquary, you
      send her. She is not very well: the weather has been hot, although our house is well
      shaded with the trees I planted 20 years ago. But I cannot but feel apprehensive
      that shall be compelled to give it up: prices of paintings are so low, and no
      purchasers, at that. I do not know what she would do, forced to quit her  nice home: but
      such things will occur, and then it is, at my, or our age, like parting with life
      itself: there are times, when pinched by necessity and age, we feel that life is not
      worth living for. How well you have endured your trials, (physical) without
      complaining.

   <p>Han is very nervous: taxes (25) are overdue: every year they are increased – pay
      no rent, yet taxes are something.

   <p>I shall be pleased to see and read your book. My Sister Mrs Coll sends me a little
      money at times, which buys a load of wood and some groceries. Han says she is a
      good, good woman.

   <p>I experience nervous prostration occasionally. I had a shock this morning: all things
      seemed rain – life not worth preserving. I am better now – Han would scold me
      for writing –

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00207_n1">1. Hannah Louisa Whitman
      Heyde (1823–1908) was Walt Whitman's younger sister, and she was one of
      the only members of the Whitman family to read and admire Whitman's writings.
      She married Charles Heyde in 1852, and the couple lived in Burlington, Vermont.
      Charles regularly disparaged his wife and her sometimes erratic behavior in his
      letters. For more information on Hannah, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
