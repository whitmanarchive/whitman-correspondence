   <p>Sent letter to Worthen<sup><a href="#loc.00443_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—as soon as received &nbsp;Mother received letter and book—by the way can I get one of

      able to pay you a short visit this winter—soon after the Holidays—everything is going
      abt as usual with us at home

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00443_n1">1. William Ezra Worthen
      (1819–97) graduated from Harvard in 1838 and soon became a leading civil
      and hydraulic engineer. He designed and built many dams and mills in New
      England, some of which still operate. Originally from Massachusetts, he settled
      in New York in 1849 and served as sanitary engineer of the Metropolitan Board of
      Health of New York City, 1866–69. He became noted for designing and
      testing pumping engines, including some for James P. Kirkwood during the early
      stages of the new St. Louis Water Works, and developed a major reputation as a
      consultant. He published several books on engineering and served as president of
      the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1887.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00443_n2">2. Jeff probably wanted to
      give Edward Ruggles a copy of <em>Drum-Taps</em> or William D.
      O'Connor's <em>The Good Grey Poet</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00443_n3">3. Moses Lane
      (1823–82) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. Joseph Phineas Davis (1837–1917) took a degree in
      civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1856 and then helped
      build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He was a topographical engineer in
      Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned to Brooklyn. A lifelong friend
      of Jeff's, he became city engineer of Boston (1871–80) and completed his
      distinguished career as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph
      Company (1880–1908).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00443_n4">4. Probably either John or
      Robert McNamee, both of whom were engineers.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00443_n5">5. Probably David Brower,
      an engineer who worked for the city.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00443_n6">6. Probably William H.
      Story, a surveyor.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00443_n7">7. The son of Congressman
      Tunis G. Bergen (see Jeff Whitman's letter to Walt from ), Van Brunt Bergen (1841–1917) graduated from
      Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1863 with a degree in civil engineering. He
      was employed on the Brooklyn Water Works from 1864 to 1895 and wrote a short
      history of the department which was printed in Henry R. Stiles, ed., <em>The Civil, Political, Professional, and Ecclesiastical
         History...of the County of Kings and the City of Brooklyn, N.Y. from 1683 to
         1884</em> (New York: W. W. Munsell &amp; Co., 1884), 584–94.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00443_n8">8. In Brooklyn at this
      time there were three engineers by the name of Ward: James, John, and
      Timothy.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00443_n9">9. Probably David J.
      Lewis, an engineer.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00443_n10">10. Unidentified.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00443_n11">11. Robert Van Buren
      (1843–?) graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1864 and
      joined the Brooklyn Water Works in 1865 as an assistant engineer. He was
      promoted to chief engineer in 1877, resigned in 1879, and was then reappointed
      in 1880 and held the post until 1893.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00443_n12">12. The family had moved
      to 840 Pacific Streeet on May 1, 1866. Located on top of a hill, this house was
      difficult to heat, but as Louisa Van Velsor Whitman noted, "Jeffy makes my fire
      when it is very cold" (see her letter to Walt Whitman from January 17, 1867
      [Trent Collection, Duke University]).<a href="#r12">[back]
