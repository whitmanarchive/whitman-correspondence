   <p>John Swinton lives at 134 east 34th Street. (He is married lately to Mrs Dr Smith)—Yes
      [J.H.] Johnston's taking part in the lecture enterprise would be perfectly agreeable
      to me<sup><a href="#sjs.00004_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—the name of the lecture, would be <em>The death of Abraham Lincoln</em>.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>(In my last letter among the names proposed was S S Cox,<sup><a href="#sjs.00004_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> M C—<em>I wish that name cancelled</em>)—I should well like to have, if the letter to me is carried out, a real mixture of
      names, representing the young blood, &amp; all the parties, various professions, (especially
      as I said, <em>journalists</em>, <em>artists</em>, <em>actors</em>, &amp;c &amp;c—perhaps <em>some women</em>)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall be home here all the following two weeks except next Saturday &amp; Sunday<sup><a href="#sjs.00004_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="sjs.00004_n1">1. Whitman also wrote to
      Burroughs on  about the New York
      lecture, and evidently listed the names of possible sponsors. Whitman had been
      with the Staffords from March 2 to 4 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00004_n2">2. In a letter on , Burroughs asked for Swinton's
      address and inquired about Johnston.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00004_n3">3. Samuel S. Cox
      (1828–1889) served in the House of Representatives from New York from 1869
      until his death. Burroughs, when asked why Whitman wanted Cox's name deleted,
      could not recall any reason (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
      172).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00004_n4">4. Whitman was with the
      Staffords again on Saturday and Sunday, March 9 and 10 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r4">[back]
