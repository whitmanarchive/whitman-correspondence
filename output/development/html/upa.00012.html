   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your late letter has just reached me—&amp; I write at once to at least say specifically
      that both your letter of Sept. 6 and that of Oct. 15<sup><a href="#upa.00012_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> safely reached me—this that comes to-day being the third.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Again I will say that I am sure I appreciate &amp; accept your letters, &amp; all they stand
      for, as fully as even you, dear friend, could wish—&amp; as lovingly &amp; <em>bona fide</em>.<sup><a href="#upa.00012_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
