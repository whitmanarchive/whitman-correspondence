   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00761_n1">1. The Marquis de Leuville
      was William Redivivus Oliver de Lorncourt, born in 1841; he enjoyed some
      notoriety as a poet who wrote in French and English. His <em>Poems
         and Aelia from "Entre-Nous"</em> appeared in 1884 (London: Chapman &amp;
      Hall), and the introduction, called "Entre-Nous," begins, "I had therefore
      better make some apologies for my 'French-English.'"<a href="#r1">[back]
