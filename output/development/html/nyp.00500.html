   <p>The following answer of mine to an article in the <em>Nation</em> of
      July 26 having been refused publication by that paper, it is sent to you, not in any
      controversial spirit, but because the facts I give are of current interest, and
      should be kept well before the American public, especially the New York portion of
      it. Washington Sept: 1883
   </p>
   
   <p>I suggest that you send it to the N. Y. <em>Sun</em> for their Sunday
      edition—with the preceding note—Dana I think is more or less
      friendly<sup><a href="#nyp.00500_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
