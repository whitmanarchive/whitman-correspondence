   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edmund Routledge was the son of George Routledge
      (1812–1888), founder of the London publishing firm George Routledge &amp;
      Sons. In 1867 the London <em>Broadway Annual</em>, published by
      Routledge &amp; Sons and edited by Edmund Routledge, printed two sympathetic
      accounts of Walt Whitman. American novelist W. Clark Russell termed Whitman one
      of America's eminent poets, and Robert Buchanan devoted an entire article to
      Walt Whitman; see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> (1906–1996), 1:45, 188–195. On December 28, 1867,
      the New York office of the firm requested that Whitman contribute "one or two
      papers or poems" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:263).
      Whitman sent "Whispers of Heavenly Death" in February 1868 and received $50 in
      compensation, which he accepted in his , letter to Routledge &amp; Sons. The poem, however, did not
      appear in the <em>Broadway Annual</em> until October 1868.
