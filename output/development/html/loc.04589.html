      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was profoundly touched, and greatly enriched and honored, by your unexpected gift.
      From every point of view, I dont see that anything of more worth could be added to
      the hoard of—1. An American, 2. A book-lover, 3. A devotee of the great, the
      broad, the original, the imaginative, in poetry and humane literature, 4. Of one
      whose
   </p>
   
   <p><u>2</u></p>
   
   <p>good fortune it is to be your friend, your contemporary, your appreciative student
      and reader.
   </p>
   
   <p>You have indeed done well, in thus bringing together, under one cover &amp; in this
      striking and unique shape, all your life-work. There is no book just like this,
      &amp; there never will be. The <u>personal</u> note is
      everywhere. Moreover, as a <u>book</u> merely, the most famous
      bibliophile—with the famous binders &amp; printers, &amp; a mine of wealth, to
      aid him—could not get up a volume so notable &amp; so sure of ever-growing
      value. This would be my notion of the volume, as
   </p>
   
   <p><u>3</u></p>
   
   <p>a <u>book</u>, if I knew nothing of its author—of its "only
      begetter." Moreover, it impresses one as the result of a growth: of something not
      <u>made</u>, off-hand, but the final outcome of a certain
      [
      <span class="unclear">secular?</span>]
      
      evolution.
   </p>
   
   <p>For the regard, the affection, which convoyed your noble argosy to this my
      haven,—believe me, my dear &amp; honored old Bard, they are returned to you
      four-fold.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have delayed this letter a few days, because it was in my mind to send you a
      return-gage: a more dimensional, but
   </p>
   
   <p><u>4</u></p>
   
   <p>otherwise inadequate, symbol of our common nationalism &amp; outlook. To-day, then, I
      forward to you by express the first seven volumes of the "Library of American
      Literature" (the seventh enriched by your own poetry and portrait)—which you
      will accept, I trust, &amp; which surely will seem of more significance to Walt
      Whitman than any other gift which <u>I</u> could send him. The
      succeeding volumes will reach you as they came from the press.—If you live to
      read them all,—well, I needn't wish you any
   </p>
   
   <p><u>5</u></p>
   
   <p>greater length of years! To edit them, we have served as many years as Jacob served
      for Rachel, and I fear our practical returns will be as disappointing as he found
      the gift of Leah.
   </p>
   
   <p>However,—<u>you</u> of all men will take in, comprehend, the
      purpose, the meaning, of this long compilation. <u>You</u> will
      justly
   </p>
   
   <p><u>6</u></p>
   
   <p>estimate its significance, &amp; this quite irrespectively of its literary or
      artistic qualities. There are masterpieces in it. But it is <u>not</u> a collection of masterpieces: it is something of more moment to you
      &amp; me. It is <u>America</u>. It is the symbolic, the
      essential, America from her infancy to the second Century of her grand Republic. It
      is the diary, the year-book, the Century-book, of her progress from Colonialism to
      Nationality. All her health &amp;
   </p>
   
   <p><u>7</u></p>
   
   <p>disease are here: her teething, measles, mumps, joy, delirium, nuptials, conflicts,
      dreams, delusions, her meanness &amp; her nobility. We purposely make the work <u>inclusive</u>—trying to show every facet of this our
      huge, as yet half-cut, rose-diamond.
   </p>
   
   <p>So I know that, in turning these pages, from the early "adventure", from the early
      theology &amp; superstition, from the early heroism &amp; <u>grit</u>, down to
   </p>
   
   <p>8</p>
   
   <p>the latest moment of our wondrous development,—I know that you will be
      seeing, in your chamber, what you have so observed &amp; thought upon for
      years—as you went to &amp; fro, among the people, through the land &amp; under
      the canopy. In short, I send you an American "cosmorama" for your own room: hoping
      it may lighten some of the hours of your retirement there, &amp; that it may now
      &amp; then remind you of its designer.
   </p>
   
   <p>Nothing better becomes this compilation than the portion covering selections from
      your
   </p>
   
   <p><u>9</u></p>
   
   <p>own work. Fine as it is, I said to Miss Hutchinson<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r1">1</a></sup> that I could
      readily obtain half-a-dozen counterparts, equally imaginative and noble, from your
      "Leaves of Grass," etc.—It is my hope that you see, from the manner in which
      that <u>précis</u> is made up, that I do measurably
      comprehend your genius &amp; philosophy; that I have <u>understood</u> your purposes in life &amp; in art. A chap was here, 'tother
      day, who had been visiting you. He reported you
   </p>
   
   <p><u>10</u></p>
   
   <p>as saying that I wouldn't take off my hat to Apollo, if we sh<u>d</u> 
      happen to meet. That
      pleased me immensely, &amp; I "laughed consumedly", as the old Comedies say. Well:
      there <u>is</u> too much taking off of hats, but I certainly
      should doff my own to the Sun-God. On the other hand, if it should prove cold in his
      neighborhood, I should speedily clap it on again.—Nor have I ever essayed <u>serious &amp; prolonged criticism</u> of any man, unless I
      deemed him worthy of it—i.e. <u>great</u>. For the
      small-fry, a few passing words &amp; kindly phrases are quite enough. This is my
      longest letter of the year—rambling enough, but may you have plenty of time to
      read a thousand such! And so always think of me as one of your most faithful
      lovers—for such indeed is

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
