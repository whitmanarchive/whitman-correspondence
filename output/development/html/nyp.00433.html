   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00433_n1">1. Interestingly, Whitman
      praises Baxter for the lengthy review of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      in the Boston <em>Herald</em> on October 30 without acknowledging
      his own contributions to this review. For discussion of this review, see Kenneth
      M. Price and Janel Cayer, "'It might be us speaking instead of him!':
      Individuality, Collaboration and the Networked Forces Contributing to
      'Whitman,'" forthcoming in <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly
         Review</em>.<a href="#r1">[back]

      Whitman on October 28 and 29 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
