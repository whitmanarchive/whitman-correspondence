   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Watson Gilder
      (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <em>The Century</em>, from 1881 until his death. Whitman had met
      Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1955], 482). Whitman attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
      Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the <em>New York Tribune</em>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder
      one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
      delirium" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">Sunday, August 5, 1888</a>). For more about Gilder, see Susan L.
      Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_95.html">Gilder, Richard Watson (1844–1909)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02223_n1">1. Whitman's "Army Hospitals
      and Cases: Memoranda at the Time, 1863–1866" had first appeared in a
      series for the <em>New York Weekly Graphic</em> and was later
      reprinted in <em>The Century</em>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02223_n2">2. Whitman's "Father Taylor and
      Oratory" was published in <em>The Century</em> in February 1887.
      Edward Thompson Taylor (1793–1871) was an American Methodist clergyman who
      was well regarded for his oratory skills. Whitman in "Father Taylor" described
      him as "the only essentially perfect orator" he had ever heard.<a href="#r2">[back]
