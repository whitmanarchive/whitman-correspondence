   </p>
   
   <p>I wonder how you are getting on this hot weather! I did hope that we were not going
      to have any very hot weather this Summer but the past two or three days have been
      very hot.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have thought of you so much &amp; 
      wondred
      
       how you are 
      geting
      
       on I should have written to you before this had I not heard from you
      through pap &amp; Debbie.<sup><a href="#n0844b" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp;
      Herbert<sup><a href="#n6151" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      comes down once in A while &amp; we hear from you through him. I have been in Camden
      once or twice &amp; should have called to see you but thought perhaps my coming would
      not be pleasant to you as we understood that you did not see only A few of your friends.
   </p>
   
   <p>I went to Marlton to day saw Harry<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; Eva<sup><a href="#n6107" id="r4">4</a></sup>

      twice at your place some time Ago but couldnot see you
   </p>
   
   <p>I suppose you know that George Stafford<sup><a href="#n0852" id="r5">5</a></sup> has sold the old place
      at Kirkwood everything is changed there now. it's all laid out in Building lots &amp;
      Avenues. &amp; the old pond has become quite A pleasure resort. one cant go ther now with-out meeting hundreds of people
   </p>
   
   <p>how much we should like to see you with us once again but suppose that can never be.
      Its A pleasure to know that you are comfortable—am glad to know that Mrs D<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r6">6</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0844b">1. Deborah Stafford was the sister of
      Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. She
      married Joseph Browning. See <em>Daybooks and Notebooks</em>, ed.
      William White (New York: New York University Press, 1978), 1:35. Debbie and
      Harry's parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse
      Farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions.
      For more on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>" <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, ed., (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 685.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6151">2. Herbert Gilchrist (1857–1914) was a painter
      and the son of Anne Gilchrist. For more on him, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>". Gilchrist often visited
      the Staffords when in New York.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0590">3. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n6107">4. Eva Westcott married Harry Stafford in 1884.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0852">5. George Stafford was the father of
      Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's
      parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near
      Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. For more
      on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>" <em>Walt Whitman: An

         </a></p>
   <p id="n6113">6. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_92.html">Davis, Mary Oakes (1837 or 1838–1908)</a>," <em>Walt

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">7. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r7">[back]
