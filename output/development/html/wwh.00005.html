   <p>. . . town, I see."<sup><a href="#wwh.00005_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I asked him if he meant George, and he said yes—he saw his name, Capt. George W.
      Whitman, U. S. A. in the newspaper list of hotel arrivals, at the Avenue House, two
      days before. I was quite dumb-foundered—went right away to the Avenue House, and searching
      the register, I found it was Capt. George J. Whitman, 3d Wisconsin Vol. So you see
      there are two Capt. George Whitmans in the Army. I was a great mind to ask to see
      the Wisconsin Whitman—but I didn't.

   <p>I go to the Hospitals about the same as ever—the last week or so. I have been most
      every night to the Capitol, which has been all lit up—I should never get tired of
      wandering through the Senate wing at night—it is the most costly, splendid and rich-painted
      place in its interminable mazes (I wander around and lose myself in them) of corridors
      and halls, that I ever dreamed of, or thought possible to construct—The great Halls
      of the H[ouse] of R[epresentatives] and the Senate, are wonderful and brilliant at
      night—they show best then, (in some respects.) They are probably the most beautiful
      rooms, ornamented and gilded style, in the world.

   <p>About what is called the Conscript Bill (an improper name) I hope and pray from the
      bottom of my heart that, if they (the Government) are indeed going on with the war,
      they will carry out that bill, and enrol <em>every man</em> in the land—I would like to see the people embodied <em>en-masse</em>—I am very sure I shall see that my name is in its place on the lists, and my body
      in the ranks, if they do it that way—for <em>that</em> will be something like our nation getting itself up in shape. The Bill however was
      really meant as a warning to Louis Napoleon, or any other foreign meddler. With my
      office-hunting, no special result yet. I cannot give up my Hospitals yet. I never
      before had my feelings so thoroughly and (so far) permanently absorbed, to the very
      roots, as by these huge swarms of dear, wounded, sick, dying boys—I get very much
      attached to some of them, and many of them have come to depend on seeing me, and having
      me sit by them a few minutes, as if for their lives.

   <p>Jeff, I am very fat and hearty—I have found friends here—I met a lady in the street
      day before yesterday that was so much like Mat I could hardly keep from speaking to
      her. I guess she wondered what I stood and looked, and looked, at her so long for.
      She drest like Mat too, and was . . .

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <p id="wwh.00005_n1">1. At one time there were at
      Camden two additional pages which presumably belonged to this letter;
      unfortunately, no transcription was made. The pages reproduced here do not
      appear to be part of the letter from 
      , which is also
      incomplete. In a letter from , Jeff
      noted receipt of "a long letter from you Saturday" (which would have been March
      7, 1863). But the principal argument for the date of March 6 is that on , Jeff asked his brother: "What are
      they going to do to reinforce the army, will they have to enforce the conscript
      bill."<a href="#r1">[back]
