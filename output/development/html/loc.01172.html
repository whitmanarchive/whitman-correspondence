      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been back home since 21st of July. I had to come back to look after my farm.
      The heavy rains came near 
      washing it away. Wife &amp; Julian<sup><a href="#loc.01151_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> are still up in the mountains &amp; are well. I &amp; my man live alone in the 
      old house, I am chief cook &amp; bottle washer I keep well &amp; busy, &amp; am not having a very
      bad time
      after all. In a couple of weeks my grapes will be all off (only 1/2 crop this year)
      &amp; I shall take another holiday
   </p>
   
   <p>Hope to see you in Sept, I trust you keep well as usual. I rec'd a letter from you
      at Hobart which I sent on to 
      Buck,<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> with one from Eldridge,<sup><a href="#n0210" id="r3">3</a></sup> 
      I read Williams<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r4">4</a></sup> pamphlet on Donnelley's Reviewers<sup><a href="#loc.01172_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> with melancholy enjoyment. It is very brilliant &amp; effective, quite equal to
      his best work I think. If he had only left out some of his mud-Epithets, and if 
      he had only not
      claimed Montaignes Essays &amp; Burtons Melancholy for Bacon! How such a claim as that
      does discredit the whole business.
      I suppose the evidence that Montaigne wrote his Essays is as good as that Bacon wrote
      the Essays that bear his name. 
      W<u>m</u> was fated to slop over in just this way, &amp; to steel his reader against him. I have
      as 
      yet seen no allusion to his book in the literary journals.
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish you were here to enjoy this view, &amp; this air, &amp; also my grapes &amp; peaches. Drop
      me a card.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01151_n1">1. Julian Burroughs
      (1878–1954), the only son of John and Ursula Burroughs, later became a
      landscape painter, writer, and photographer.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0210">3. Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">4. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.01172_n2">5. In his pamphlet <em>Mr. Donnelly's Reviewers</em> (Chicago: Belford, Clarke &amp;
      Co., 1889), William D. O'Connor attempted to defend Ignatius Loyola Donnelly's
      Baconian argument—his theory that Shakespeare's plays had been written by
      Francis Bacon—an idea Donnelly wrote about in his book <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in Shakespeare's Plays</em>,
      published in 1888.<a href="#r5">[back]
