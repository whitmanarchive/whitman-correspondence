   <p>I wish you could take half an hour if possible &amp; go around for me to Mr Cox<sup><a href="#n3143" id="r2">2</a></sup> photographer cor: 12th St. &amp; Broadway. He advertises
      (Century, Sept. number) to sell my photo, with autograph. The latter is forged,
      &amp; the former illegal &amp; unauthorized. When in N Y last April I was taken
      there by Miss Gilder<sup><a href="#n0264" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; sat for pictures under promise that
      I should see them in specimens &amp; decide wh' should be printed &amp; put forth,
      &amp; wh' not. Since, all requests to have them (proofs or specimens) sent me here
      have been ignored. The whole thing is <u>cool</u>, very. Go round
      &amp; see if C will immediately send me copies of the pictures &amp; follow my
      requests ab't them—Or will it be necessary for me to clap a legal injunction
      on the issue?—wh' I shall certainly do—You can show this note to Mr
      Cox<sup><a href="#sal.00004_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n3143">2. George Collins "G. C." Cox
      (1851–1903) was a well-known celebrity photographer who had taken
      photographs of Whitman when the poet was in New York for a lecture. "The
      Laughing Philosopher," one of the most famous photographs of Whitman, was taken
      by Cox in 1887. It is reproduced in <em>Specimen Days</em> (1971),
      plate 174. <a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0264">3. Jeannette Leonard Gilder (1849–1916) helped
      her brother, Richard Watson Gilder, edit <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> and then, with another brother, Joseph Benson Gilder, co-edited
      the <em>Critic</em> (which she co-founded in 1881). For more, see

   <p id="sal.00004_n2">4. As letters to Cox, Carey,
      and Johnston later in the month indicate, Whitman was needlessly concerned about
      the sale of his photographs with a forged signature. On September 3 he noted in
      The Commonplace Book: "Johnston went to see Cox, photographer—J thinks 'it
      is all right.' " Although Johnston wrote on September 10 about a suspected
      forgery (Charles E. Feinberg Collection, the Library of Congress), Carey, who
      handled the financial arrangements (see [Letter from Walt Whitman to John H.
      Johnston, 29 September 1887]), forwarded from Cox to Whitman $42 on October 3,
      $16.50 on November 2, and $15.50 on December 2 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.). Note also Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in
