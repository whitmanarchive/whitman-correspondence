   <p>I was glad last evening to get a card from you dated 22d. I wish I could see you to
      have a real good talk with you about the "Complete Works,"<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r2">2</a></sup> I have a feeling that
      there is a chance to do something really worth while, something quite in the
      monumental style in the care of this vol. I should like to see it—what it
      might easily be—something unique &amp; special. I trust you will give it full
      consideration before taking any actual steps. The "Nov. Boughs"<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r3">3</a></sup> I think decidedly
      should be published at a low figure and it should contain <u>a
         full advertisement of the "C.W."</u>—be a sort of <u>avant courier</u> of these. I will not trouble you by  repeating all I have said in former
      letters on this subject but leave it now to your serious consideration.
   </p>
   
   <p>Today John Nesbit<sup><a href="#n4153" id="r4">4</a></sup> comes down and he, Willy Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; myself
      will have a consultation re the meter. The meter is the great thing with us here just
      now and will be until it is put into some kind of shape—something definitely
      settled about it.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all well.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07225_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is

   <p id="n4151">2. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n4153">4. John Nesbit was a partner
      with Bucke and Gurd in the marketing of the gas meter; see Bucke's
      letter to Whitman of .<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n4284">5. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
