   <p><em>Noon</em>—Feeling pretty well—dark &amp; rainy (the
      third day)—News not favorable from O'C[onnor]<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> as you will
      see by enc'd card<sup><a href="#loc.07584_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I write a few lines every day to

      (considerably reduced) of that ¾ pict: McK[ay]<sup><a href="#n4983" id="r5">5</a></sup> got in N Y.
      is good, &amp; I shall use it in book before long—Shall send it you (probably
      several impressions) soon as I have them printed nicely—definite bowel action
      this forenoon—the <em>Sat: Review</em> (March 2) has either gone
      to you, or will soon go (A rather curious notice)—I haven't seen Lawyer
      Harned<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n1" id="r6">6</a></sup> since you went<sup><a href="#loc.07584_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup>—Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r8">8</a></sup> was in this forenoon—faithful &amp;
      invaluable as ever—Mrs: Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r9">9</a></sup> has come in for a few
      moments to see if I am "all right"—Ed<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r10">10</a></sup> has been making up
      the bed.

   <p><em>Toward sunset</em></p>
   
   <p>Had a good thorough bath this afternoon, hot water—my "cold" has not altogether
      withdrawn—I feel it in the head perceptibly enough an hour or two now and
      then—heavy sloppy muddy day—I almost envy your having such lots to do,
      responsibilities &amp; strong &amp; well &amp; energetic to do 'em—My <em>lassitude</em> is one of the worst points in my
      condition—but whether Sidney Morse's<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r11">11</a></sup> man's answer (when
      reproach'd for drunkenness) "Suppose 'twas so intended to be," was right or
      no—Mrs: Davis's woman's remark is "So it really <em>is</em> any
      how"—&amp; answers all philosophy &amp; argument (up to a certain line you
      probably say)—Well I will adjust myself for dinner, &amp; hope you &amp; Mrs

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n4137">4. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel, was Horace Traubel's
      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4267">8. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert

      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
