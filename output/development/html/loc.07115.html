      Whitmanesque preface—it is right, could not be excelled, is just what was
      wanted—now for the Vol. of Tales<sup><a href="#loc.07351_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup>—it ought to
      be out for Xmas since several of them are Xmas stories.

   <p>but now I am in favor of Phila for the sake of the dear Pharisees there. If I were
      down East and assisting to run the thing I would give them (at least try to give
      them) a dose that they would remember and that would do them good. I would go in for
      the biggest hall or theatre to be had and would take care that the people knew what
      was being done to check freedom of speech in the city<sup><a href="#loc.07842_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup>—I do not doubt the occasion properly handled could be converted into a
      splendid triumph for the good cause—I hope &amp; trust our friends are awake
      to the importance of the crisis—tell Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r8">8</a></sup> if money is
      wanted to put me down for $50. and that I will send it any moment.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Lovely bright cool day here—we are all well—meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r9">9</a></sup> goes on quietly and well—it is 
      wonderfull
      
       however what time it takes to get started manufacturing—the making
      of the

   <p>patterns and the tools is what is delaying us now—these should be ready or
      about ready by the end of this week—we have been quite a few weeks at
      them—When the tools and patterns are once done there will be no more delay.
      The next thing will be to get <u>orders</u> for meters—if
      we can get these we can make money about as fast as we like

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4137">4. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

      stories with a preface by Whitman were published in <em>Three
         Tales: The Ghost, The Brazen Android, The Carpenter</em> (Boston and New
      York: Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., 1892). The preface was included in <em>Good-Bye My Fancy</em> (1891), 51-53.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n4267">8. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
