   </p>
   
   <p>I have left word at the office Armory Square hospital about Caleb Babbitt's descriptive
      list.<sup><a href="#med.00304_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> Poor boy, I should like much to see him &amp; soothe him—I hope he will yet keep up his
      spirits. About the package of books, direct them to me, (if you should find convenient
      to send them) to Washington, 456 Sixth St north, 3d story back room—Should you see
      Mr. Shillaber<sup><a href="#med.00304_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> tell him I see Frank McDonald every day or so—I saw him last evening, saw his wound
      and examined it—he still lies constantly in bed—The wound is not in a very favorable
      way, yet nothing really serious—Mr. S must write and send papers to him &amp;c, often
      as convenient—I am well &amp; in hospitals every day—So, dear friend, good bye for present—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Townsend Trowbridge
      was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
      Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
      Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
      Eldridge edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He again met Whitman
      in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Secretary Chase in order to
      gather material for his biography, <em>The Ferry Boy and the
         Financier</em> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described their meetings
      in <em>My Own Story, with recollections of noted persons</em>
      (Boston: Houghton and Mifflin, 1903), 360–401. On December 11, Trowbridge
      had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending Whitman; see the letter
      from 
      . Though Trowbridge was
      not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to O'Connor in 1867: "Every year confirms
      my earliest impression, that no book has approached the power and greatness of
      this book, since the Lear and Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A. Coleman,
      "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <em>American Literature</em>, 23
      [1951–52], 327). For Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Rowman
      and Littlefield, 1961], 3:506. See also Coleman, "Trowbridge and Whitman," <em>Publications of the Modern Language Association of America
         [PMLA]</em>, 63 (1948): 262–273. For several weeks in 1863, Trowbridge
      stayed with Whitman in Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William
      D. O'Connor.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00304_n3">1. At Whitman's request,
      Trowbridge visited Babbitt (see Whitman's letter from ) in Mason Hospital, and wrote on , that his discharge was delayed
      because of Dr. Bliss's failure to send a descriptive list. "What [Babbitt] needs
      is sympathizing friends around him. He is very lonesome lying here on his back,
      with no Walt Whitman to cheer him up." Trowbridge's letter of , informed Walt Whitman that the
      descriptive list had arrived, and that the package contained two copies of <em>The Drummer Boy, a Story of the War in Verse</em> (1862) by
      "Cousin John," one of which "I wish you would leave at Mr. Chase's" (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 9
      vols., 4:290).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="med.00304_n4">2. Benjamin Penhallow
      Shillaber (1814–1890) was a celebrated humorist and newspaperman. While he
      was with the <em>Boston Post</em>, he invented the American
      version of Mrs. Malaprop, and <em>The Life and Sayings of Mrs.
         Partington</em> (New York: J.C. Derby, 1854) was a best-seller. John
      Townsend Trowbridge was associated with Shillaber in the short-lived comic
      journal <em>Carpet Bag</em>, in which appeared the first writings
      of Artemus Ward and Mark Twain. Shillaber wrote to Whitman about Babbitt on
      December 14, 1863 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Rowman and
      Littlefield, 1961], 2:96–97). See Trowbridge, <em>My Own
         Story, with recollections of noted persons</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1903), 179–182; and Cyril Clemens, "Benjamin Shillaber and His 'Carpet
      Bag,'" <em>New England Quarterly</em>, 14 (1941):
