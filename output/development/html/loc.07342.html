   <p>I have yours 28 Feb. and 1 March enclosing John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      of 27 Feb<sup><a href="#loc.07342_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>. and the funny little wood cut. So you have
      become immortal in a cigar advertisement!!<sup><a href="#loc.07342_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> Well done! I always thought you would
      come to something if you stuck to your business long enough! Burroughs' letter is
      deeply interesting—but what ails the fellow that he is so damned pathetic? He
      is (I judge) fairly well fixed (as things go)—good reputation, lovely home,
      enough to eat &amp;c. &amp;c. then why is he so infernally down in the month all the
      time? I don't see anything to whine about in getting old—think (on the whole)
      it is rather a good joke—my strongest feeling
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>about it is: what is to come next? That we are going to (or towards) the bad all the
      time does not occur to me as likely at all and if not what is there to be blue
      about? I have just received and answered the enclosed long letter from Mrs O'Connor<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      which I am sure you would like to read—you need not return it. I have some
      notion that I may take a week's run about middle of April to Philadelphia, Baltimore
      and Washington. I shall look out for the May Century with considerable interest.<sup><a href="#loc.07342_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> We
      are pegging away at the meter trying to get it on its feet and I look to succeed all
      in good time but it will take weeks perhaps months yet

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0129">1. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n4137">4. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
