   <p>Am sitting here a while to contrast the fearful tedium of lying in bed so
      long—eking a half hour more, to sit up here—though slowly &amp;
      moderately, seems to me <em>I am decidedly better</em>, wh' sums all
      at present—seem to fall from one pit to a lower pit—what is to come
      remains to be seen—Dr Walsh<sup><a href="#n4144" id="r2">2</a></sup> (who is not very definitive)
      says it is an extreme case (this very last) of prostration &amp; gastric trouble
      from indigestion—Monday, Tuesday &amp; Wednesday last were worst—Tuesday
      was deathly—yesterday &amp; to-day I begin at milk &amp; broth &amp; sit up
      more—feel pretty fair as I sit here this moment—have drink'd some sherry
      mix'd with milk—(wine, whey)—Hope you have rec'd the copies of the big
      book<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r3">3</a></sup>, sent by Canadian Express (sent last Thursday)—Hope you are not
      disappointed (or vex'd) at its looks—as it is, for all nine-tenths of L of G.
      are from normal al fresco genesis (beef, meat, wine, sunny, lusty) and three fourths
      of the rest of the trilogy ditto—it is fished out of one of Dante's hells,
      considering my physical condition the last three months—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, I will get to bed, with Ed's<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r4">4</a></sup> help—
   </p>
   
   <p><em>Monday afternoon</em> Dec. 17—Fairly passable last night
      &amp; some chicken broth for breakfast—anticipated a pretty good day &amp; a
      good bath in the wash room, but not accomplish'd yet—Yours of 15th<sup><a href="#loc.07558_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> rec'd—Am sitting up—a dismal dark sticky
      rainy day—Suppose the big books must be to hand now—sweat easily, the
      least encouragement—quite great thirst—drink milk a good deal—have
      just eaten some vanilla ice cream—just rec'd an Italian (Palermo) paper<sup><a href="#loc.07558_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup>—&amp; the Paris <em>Revue
         Independent</em> for Nov: with notice of L of G,<sup><a href="#loc.07558_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup> wh'
      I mail you—send me the synopsis when you have an opportunity—my head is
      in a sore poor condition—

      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07558_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr R M Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden,
      N.J. | Dec 18 | 6 AM | 88.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4144">2. Dr. Walsh was the brother of
      William S. Walsh (1854–1919), an American author and editor of <em>Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</em>. Richard Maurice Bucke
      arranged to have him accompany Dr. William Osler to see Whitman, since Bucke
      believed it would be useful to have a younger doctor examine the poet. See
      Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.35.html">Wednesday, December 5, 1888</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">3. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">4. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.07558_n2">5. See Bucke's letter to
      Whitman of .<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07558_n3">6. Perhaps a review of the
      translation <em>Canti Scelti</em> by Luigi Gamberale in 1887; see
      Gay Wilson Allen, <em>Walt Whitman Abroad</em> (1955), 187.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07558_n4">7. On , Bucke noted that the article in
      <em>Revue Indèpendante</em> contained eight pages of
      translations by Francis Vielé-Griffin (1863 or 1864–1907) and "no
      comment at all": "Translation not good (translator did not fully understand the
      English text)" (Feinberg). See also P. M. Jones, "Whitman in France," <em>MLR</em>, 10 (1915), 16-17.<a href="#r7">[back]
