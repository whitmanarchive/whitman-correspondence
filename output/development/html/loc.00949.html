      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter was very welcome, and I<sup><a href="#loc.00949_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup> have not forgotten you one day, though I have not written you. But I have been very
      much occupied in thought, as well as much of my time in going daily, &amp; some days twice
      to see Miss Howard.<sup><a href="#loc.00949_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Her sister Sallie has the worst form of typhoid fever. She has been very ill for
      three weeks, &amp; alarmingly so for over ten days. Her mother was sent for more than a week ago, and two doctors have come twice a day to see her
      for many days. I don't suppose there is any hope at all. She is wild with delirium
      all the time. Poor Garrie is worn, but she bears up like a hero under it, does not
      leave her sister night or day. I got a good nurse for them, as their nurse had to
      leave.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is very sad, &amp; I have not given up hoping till to-day, but she has no encouraging
      symptoms.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was so glad to hear that your little pet was better, and that your mother had got
      home! Has the little girl continued to improve? I hope so.
   </p>
   
   <p>It was good too, to hear that your mother was so well, &amp; George, &amp; all of you.</p>
   
   <p>I hope you are all well now. I trust the little girl is picking up fast.</p>
   
   <p>You ask about William.<sup><a href="#loc.00949_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> His letters have been "few and far between", four in five weeks,— but now I look
      a little for him to-morrow, Saturday, and shall surely expect him on Sunday.  I guess he has had a good time,
      &amp; he sent the <em>MSS.</em> to Curtis.  You may see him in New York to-morrow.  He will see Curtis, I suppose.
   </p>
   
   <p>When you come back what <em>lots</em> of things we shall have to talk about.
   </p>
   
   <p>I saw in the Tribune of <em>Wednesday</em> the advertisement of <em>Drum Taps</em>.  Glad we were to see it, Charley &amp; I.
   </p>
   
   <p>Have you sent one to Emerson?  <em>Do</em>, in haste, won't you?  I 
      want him to have one right away.
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Walt, will you see in New York Mr. Howells?<sup><a href="#loc.00949_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I don't even know his address, &amp; it is necessary that I should write him a business
      letter. I wonder how they are. Give him my love if you see him.
   </p>
   
   <p>Jeannie is well, &amp; sends love. I am well, so is Charley, &amp; he too, sends love. We all want to see you back.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Ashton is well, but
      <em>very busy,</em>
      &amp; looks worn.<sup><a href="#loc.00949_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> His wife is well, &amp; I guess they will come soon.
   </p>
   
   <p>Give my love to your mother, &amp; with much love to you - hoping soon to see you.</p>

      Yours—
      <br></br>Nelly.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00949_n100">1. For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen O'Connor, who, with Eldridge and later Burroughs, were
      to be his close associates during the early Washington years. William D.
      O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>,
      an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. Ellen "Nelly"
      O'Connor, William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In
      1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with William over the Fifteenth
      Amendment, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended
      Whitman's opinion, and in response William established a separate residence. The
      correspondence between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's
      correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00949_n2">2. Probably Garaphelia
      ("Garry") Howard, one of Whitman's Washington friends. In a February 11, 1874
      letter to Ellen O'Connor, Whitman describes Garaphelia Howard as "a good, tender
      girl—true as steel."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00949_n3">3. William D. O'Connor. The
      manuscript to which Ellen O'Connor refers is <em>The Good Gray
         Poet</em>. See Whitman's letters of 
      and , Ellen O'Connor's letter of
      , and William's letter of .
      <a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00949_n4">4. Charles Joseph Howells,
      according to entries in New York Directories, must have been versatile (and
      perhaps eccentric): in 1864–1865 he was an "inventor," in 1865–1866
      an inspector in the Custom House, in 1866–1867 simply an "inspector," and
      in 1867–1868 a seller of hairpins.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00949_n6">5. J. Hubley Ashton, the
      assistant Attorney General, actively interested himself in Whitman's affairs,
      and obtained a position for the poet in his office after the Harlan fracas (see
      James Harlan's letter to Whitman of ).<a href="#r5">[back]
