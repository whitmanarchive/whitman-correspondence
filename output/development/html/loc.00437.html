      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We received your letter<sup><a href="#loc.00437_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> and [were] glad to get it too—We had all begun to feel a little worried about George—glad
      to hear that you are getting along so nicely—The Expressman did not come for your
      trunk yesterday as he promised so I called last night and [a]gain left the order—to-day
      at noon they came and got it giving a receipt for it &nbsp;Enclosed I send the Key. I like
      to get letters from you &nbsp;Matters are going about as usual with us. Mother is pretty well Mattie and the Children
      very well—I hope you will enjoy your cake that they put in the trunk—It looked nice
      when I put it in &nbsp;I packed it Tuesday night and had it already Wednesday, but they
      did not come for it &nbsp;I hope to be able to make you a visit this summer yet—How would
      it do to come when the review of the Army happens<sup><a href="#loc.00437_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—could I see it or would it be like our New York shows—how long do you suppose George
      will remain around Washington?<sup><a href="#loc.00437_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I should like to come before he goes away—Write
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00437_n1">1. Whitman's letter of
      about May 3, 1865, is not extant.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00437_n2">2. The Grand Review of the
      Union armies took place in Washington, D.C., on May 23 and 24, 1865. Jeff was
      unable to attend, but Walt wrote him about it in a letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer: A Critical
         Biography of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955; rev. ed., New
      York University Press, 1967], 336–337, and Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:260–263).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00437_n3">3. On February 22, 1865,
      George gained his freedom as part of a general prisoner exchange. He was soon
      granted a thirty-day furlough, which was extended, because of his poor health,
      until about April 24. On his return to military duty he was assigned command of
      a military prison in Alexandria, Virginia, where he remained until July 27, 1865
      (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington
         Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975],
      134–136).<a href="#r3">[back]
