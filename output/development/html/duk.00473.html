   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

<div class="editorial_notes">
   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00473_n11">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      dated this letter only "Sunday." Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter January
      20, 1867, but Edwin Haviland Miller dated it January 26, 1867 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:311, n. 31; 1:377). Miller presumably relied on Walt Whitman's
      acknowledgment of a "letter of Sunday week, Jan. 26" to assign the date (see
      Walt's  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman). Walt almost certainly responded to this letter from
      Louisa—he referred to her "lameness in the wrist," and acknowledged Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman's possible trip to Washington—but January 26, 1867 fell
      on Saturday. Because Louisa wrote "Sunday," this letter dates to January 27,
      1867.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00473_n10">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      intent is unclear. After the word "one" is a stricken character that may have
      been a letter "c." She may have referred to rubbing the swollen arm "once" with
      a type of massage, or perhaps she massaged the arm with the slippery elm
      poultice that George Washington Whitman recommended. Alternately, she may have
      intended also to cancel the word "a."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00473_n2">4. The application of a
      poultice made from ground or powdered slippery elm bark was a common herbal
      treatment for swelling and infection in the nineteenth century.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00473_n12">5. Crullers are a "cake cut
      from dough containing eggs, butter, sugar, etc., twisted or curled into various
      shapes, and fried to crispness in lard or oil" (<em>Oxford English
         Dictionary</em>).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">7. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00473_n5">8. Probably Jessie Louisa
      Whitman (1863–1957), the younger daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Jessie and her sister Manahatta "Hattie" were both favorites of
      their uncle Walt. The nickname "Sis" was given first to Manahatta but was passed
      to her younger sister Jessie Louisa when Manahatta became "Hattie."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00473_n6">9. "perbasco" probably refers
      to Louis Probasco, an employee at the Brooklyn Water Works (see Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). The Whitmans had two other acquaintances named Probasco—Samuel
      R. Probasco (1833–1910), an employee at the Brooklyn Water Works from 1856
      to 1868 and an assistant engineer in the Department of City Works, and Joe
      Probasco, a soldier mentioned both in Jeff's  letter to Walt and in Walt's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Whichever Probasco this
      one is, he is mentioned again in Louisa's  letter to Walt: Jeff and his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman are said to depart for the "perbasco region." <a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00473_n14">10. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman visited Walt Whitman in Washington from February 13 to February 18,
      1867. For Walt's report on Jeff's visit, see his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">11. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r11">[back]

   <p id="duk.00473_n8">12. Mary Mix lived with her
      daughter, Juliet Grayson, who operated the boarding house at 468 M Street South,
      Washington, D.C., where Walt Whitman lived between late January 1865 and at
      least June 1866. After her daughter's death on January 7, 1867, which Walt
      Whitman reported to his mother in his  letter, Mix left Washington.<a href="#r12">[back]
