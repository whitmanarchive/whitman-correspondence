   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="owu.00013_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Sloane Kennedy | Belmont Mass:. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | Nov 6 | 8PM |
      89.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="owu.00013_n2">2. Kennedy wrote on : "Fred. Wilson writes me that if he
      publishes I must pay cost of production. I can't, so I write him to return the
      MS. to me. I must wait till I get able." Richard Maurice Bucke, to whom Whitman
      sent Kennedy's note, promised on  that
      if the meter paid off he would "ad[vance] the funds required, for I am [most?]
      anxious to have K's book pub[lished] and so made safe." On January 28, 1891,
      Kennedy informed Bucke that Wilson had not returned his manuscript: "He has
      about $200 at least subscribed. I recently wrote him again, asking him if he wd
      like to bring out the 1st half, &amp; let the Concordance slide."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07694_n2">3. Kennedy's manuscript
      eventually became two books, <em>Reminiscences of Walt
         Whitman</em> (1896) and <em>The Fight of a Book for the
         World</em> (1926). Alexander Gardner (1821–1882) of Paisley, Scotland,
      a publisher who reissued a number of books by and about Whitman, ultimately
      published <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> in 1896 after a
      long and contentious battle with Kennedy over editing the book.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.03012_n1">5. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy of .<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.02964_n5">6. William Sloane Kennedy
      married Adeline Ella Lincoln of Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1883; they lived
      for forty years in a house they built in Belmont, Massachusetts.<a href="#r6">[back]
