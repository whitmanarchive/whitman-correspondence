      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I just have your postal of the 19th, announcing the first edition out and gone in
      a day! Hooray!
      Come on, Vice Society!
   </p>
   
   <p>I am rejoiced. Rees Welsh &amp; Co ought to have printed more, but no matter. If they
      manage right now, they can secure 
      
      a prodigious sale. The main thing is not to be afraid, but to face persecution. The
      thunderstorm mounts <u>against</u> the wind.
   </p>
   
   <p>Comstock is here, probably merely on Post Office business, he being a special agent.
      If he is moving against your book, I shall hear of it. But the Department is in his
      way, as he will 
      
      find. He ought to be pitched out of the public service. It is a disgrace to the Government
      that they should employ this vile maggot bred from carrion—this rat of the cloaca—this
      lump of devil's-dung. I just want a square chance—a clear sight—to embalm him in a
      letter. Properly shown up, he would be 
      
      bounced.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have a bad dose in preparation for Tobey. There has been some delay, work presses
      me so much, together with the load of the dog day weather, and I have been really
      quite ill for a week with a severe cold. I wish I could go North for a while to recover.
   </p>
   
   <p>I got the <u>Press</u> you sent with the Rev. Mr. Morrow's remarks, which 
      
      I had already seen in the <u>Tribune</u>. He is a pearl among clergymen, and I feel grateful to him. I heard a story once
      how the brilliant Douglas Jerrold astonished an evening party in London by a constant
      fire of <u>jeu de mots</u> for hours, which continued until 
      
      every person in the room, man or woman, had been the subject of a jest or epigram,
      always splendid and nearly always tart. Finally, when the admired wit was leaving,
      every eye fixed upon him, every ear bent to hear whatever he might utter, 
      
      Charles Knight, the historian, whose sweetness of nature made him loved by all, standing
      near the door, said to him with a smile, "You've said something this evening about
      everyone here except me, Douglas; have you nothing to say about me?" "Yes," replied
      Jerrold, tenderly pressing his hand as he went 
      
      away, "Good Knight"! I feel like imitating this wit, and saying, not in parting but
      in welcome, to our new friend, "Good Morrow."
   </p>
   
   <p>I have an immensely cordial letter from Dr. Channing, who says he is going to write
      to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Send me one of the new edition when you can.</p>

      Faithfully,
      <br></br>W. D. O'Connor.
