   <p id="nyp.00491_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd June 19/83." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service |
      Treasury | Washington | DC. It is postmarked: Philadelphia | Pa. | Jun 18 | 1

   <p id="nyp.00491_n2">2. The article was allegedly
      written by Dr. P. Popoff. In the margin of a copy, however, Whitman wrote: "my
      guess (at random) is that John Swinton is the writer of this article" (Charles
      E. Feinberg Collection, Library of Congress, Washington D.C.). On , Swinton informed the poet that his
      lecture on American literature had been translated and printed in <em>Zagranichnyi Viestnik</em> (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915],
      2:393). See also Gay Wilson Allen, <em>Walt Whitman Abroad</em>
      (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1955), 145.<a href="#r2">[back]
