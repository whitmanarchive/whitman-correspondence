   <p>I have wrote to father and now I think that I will write to you and let you know how
      it goes with me. I like the place very well but it is dry here I not knowing any one
      and have no one to put me through the <u>mill</u> (as the saying is:) it is hard to get
      
      
      
      along. The folkes are very nice but most too perticular, but it is the way of some to be that way you know. When you get up to Camden it
      will be better for me for I then will have some place to go. I want to get up to see
      you once a week at least and have a good time, for I cant let
      
      
      
      my selfe out here they are too mild for that. The old Gent asked me if I was a member of Church
      and I toled him I was not and he seemed <u>disappointed</u> but hearing that I was not, he then asked me if I went to church and I toled him that I did sometimes
      
      
      wat church I went to and I said I was not of any denomination and he then asked me if
      father was a church member and I did not know what to tell him, but I got through
      with it and he said that he would set me at work after dinner so that was the way
      I spent the first day.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0590">1. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>â€”though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
