   <p>I feel quite anxious about the "Complete Works"<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r2">2</a></sup> and would like
      much to hear from you how you will deal with that book. I think:
      <br><br>
      <span>1 The book should be first class in all aspects</span><br>
      <span>2 Price should be $10.</span><br>
      <span>3 It should (every copy of it) be autograph</span><br>
      <span>4 Should contain a number of pictures</span><br>
      <span>5 Should be sold entirely by yourself</span><br>
      <span>6 A full advertisement of it should go in "N.B."<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r3">3</a></sup></span><br>
      <br>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>If you would tell Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup> to write me your decision on each of
      these points you would relieve my mind very much
   </p>
   
   <p>There is nothing new or special here, all jogging on the old way.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07229_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: LONDON | PM | AU 30 | 88 | CANADA; CAMDEN [illegible] | SEPT | [illegible] | 12PM | 1888 | REC'D.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n4151">2. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus

   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
