   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.02966_n2">2. Robert Browning (1812–1889) was one of the foremost 
      Victorian poets and playwrights, and was married to the famous poet Elizabeth Barret
      Browning (G. K. Chesterton, 
      <em>Robert Browning</em> [New York: Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 1908].<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07340_n2">3. <em>Asolando</em> (1889) is the collection of Browning's last poems. Bucke had
      long been a reader of Browning, and at one time he had even thought of writing
      on the poet. Bucke had acquired <em>The Ring and the Book</em>
      (1868-69) as it came out in parts. On 19 February 1869, he wrote harry Buxton
      Forman: "I have been so excessively busy this year . . . that I have not yet
      read Browning's new poem, that is the parts of it that I have viz. I. &amp; II.
      and I do not think I shall read it at all now except an occasional dip into it
      until I get the rest of it—I know from what I have seen of it that it is a
      great work" (Weldon). Gradually, Bucke became involved in the work (see letters
      to H.B. Forman of 16 May 1869 and 1-13 April 1870), and on 9 August 1870, he
      wrote Harry Buxton Forman: "I shall probably have a go at the 'Ring and Book'.
      Also shall perhaps find time to elaborate my theory as to the guilt of Pamphilia
      of which I am firmly persuaded. Mind you, in speaking of this matter I take for
      granted that everything that Browning says about her is the exact truth and that
      this is all we do or can know about her. Browning himself, according to my
      hypothesis, may or may not think her guilty. He is merely a faithful reporter of
      the evidence in the case and can only have an <u>opinion</u>
      about it just like anybody else. I consider it a mighty pretty subject for an
      essay and feel greatly tempted at times to try and get up something rather
      effective on the subject" (Weldon).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07340_n3">4. Bucke is referring to the
      central character in Bret Harte's "Tennessee Partner" (1869), a tale of
      California miners. Bucke may have come across this expression in his own mining
      days in California.<a href="#r4">[back]
