   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1017">1. Elisa Seaman Leggett,
      grandmother of the artist Percy Ives, corresponded sporadically with Whitman
      from 1880 until his death. A number of her letters to him are reprinted in
      Thomas Donaldson's <em>Walt Whitman: The Man</em> (New York:
      Francis P. Harper, 1896), 239–48. See also Joann P. Krieg, "Walt Whitman's
      Long Island Friend: Elisa Seaman Leggett," <em>Long Island
         Historical Journal</em> 9 (Spring 1997), 223–33.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="man.00038_n1">2. Lewis T. and Percy Ives
      were father and son, both artists. In a notation late in 1880 Whitman referred
      to Percy, "age 16, a student, intends to be an artist . . . Academy of Fine
      Arts" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On
      December 21, 1881, Percy made several pencil sketches of Whitman, and in his
      letter to his grandmother, Elisa S. Leggett, on December 25, he drew a sketch
      for her of the picture which was "in a promising condition" (Detroit Public
      Library). His oil painting of Whitman is now in the Feinberg Collection.<a href="#r2">[back]
