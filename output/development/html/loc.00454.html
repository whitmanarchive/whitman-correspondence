      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>A few days since I received from Mr O'Connor<sup><a href="#loc.00454_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> six of the little pamphlets<sup><a href="#loc.00454_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> that I wrote to you about &nbsp;They came in just right and have enabled me to make some
      very important changes in our work—I also received a letter from him yesterday saying
      that he would visit the U.S. Engineers office and pick up what he could for me—I do
      so hope he will—for they are just the books that do me the most good—and books that
      you cannot buy &nbsp;Matters are about the same with us. Mattie is not so well for a week
      or so back—but I think it is the weather and then we are not so happily situated as
      we were before we left our room over the beer house<sup><a href="#loc.00454_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—nor do we live so well—I am trying to get a house and must succeed in a week or so
      then if Mattie dont get better I shall try and send her and the children up to Min. or Wis.<sup><a href="#loc.00454_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> for some four or five months. I hope and feel pretty sure that when we get to housekeeping
      and Mat has a better time and better food she will get all right again—she is not
      near as bad as she was in Brooklyn but she is not as well as she was when she had
      been here a few weeks. The children are well and are learning to read and write and
      all that sort of thing—they behave well and get along nicely—yet they are not as comfortably
      situated [as] I hope to have them after awhile.
   </p>
   
   <p>We hav'nt heard from home in a long time &nbsp;I suppose matters are going as usual there however.
      I shall try and send George some money to-day<sup><a href="#loc.00454_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I hope he will succeed and get his houses done before the 1st of May<sup><a href="#loc.00454_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> so that Mother can get into one of them. I see that they are having some sort of
      a turn about in regard to the political offices in Brooklyn<sup><a href="#loc.00454_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—I hope that they wont reach Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00454_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> both for his own sake and for George's—It would be too bad to have any change in
      the Water Dept—The city would suffer more than could be calculated.
   </p>
   
   <p>There is a series of papers called "Papers on Practical Engineering, published by
      the Engineer Dept."<sup><a href="#loc.00454_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> that I would like very much to get—I have seen no 5 and no 7 of them—they are of
      some 30 to 40 pages each, unbound—but give what of all things is the best for me—how
      certain works were constructed and the difficulties that they had to overcome. If
      Mr O'Connor or you can send me some of them I hope you will do so. Anyway the one
      he sent ("Memoir &amp;c") gave me information so that I changed some portions of our work
      and I guess got me out of what might have turned out to be a bad fix—on the question
      of foundations. I shall write Mr O'Connor to-morrow—in the meantime please thank him
      for me—
   </p>
   
   <p>How does the new administration affect you<sup><a href="#loc.00454_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup>—I hope that it will not be to your detriment. Are you still living the same as when
      I was at Washington<sup><a href="#loc.00454_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup> and do you get along well.
   </p>
   
   <p>By the way, in my last I forgot to tell you abt the "bitters" and to thank you for them—Mat likes them first rate and I think they
      do her good. I would like to get a gallon or two of them if I could—Will you ask the
      party making them if they can be kept in a jug and if so write me how much it will
      cost to get a one or two gallon demijohn and fill it and I will send you the money.
      Mattie takes them regularly and her appetite is kept up thereby
   </p>
   
   <p>All send love to you—and hope to hear from you soon</p>

      <br></br>Affectionately yours Jeff
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Or can I buy the bitters here &nbsp;if so, and you can learn where, it will do as well</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

      the <em>Missouri Republican</em> reported on "A Political Muddle
      in Brooklyn" in which Radical Republican state legislators threatened to abolish
      the Democratic Common Council. In what may have been a related action, a new
      independent water board was created on April 2, 1869, which was no longer
      responsible to the Board of Aldermen. Shortly thereafter, Moses Lane resigned
      the position he had held for seven years and was succeeded by Colonel Julius W.
      Adams. George evidently continued to work part time in Brooklyn until the end of
