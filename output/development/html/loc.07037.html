   </p>
   
   <p>The "After All" parcel<sup><a href="#loc.07037_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> came to hand last evening to my
      great relief for I had almost given it up and had written to Washington about it.
      I
      see it was returned to you for more stamps. Thank you very much for the new (1886)
      portrait,<sup><a href="#loc.07037_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I like it very much &amp; thanks too for
      the facsimile letter with English list of contributors.<sup><a href="#loc.07037_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      I have the Centenial ed. both of L of G. &amp; 2 Riv. (sent on last order) but
      nothing further so far. You know I asked you also for L. of G. author's Ed.
      1882—also current Ed. of L. of G. &amp; specimen days, also for any thing you might have
      and be willing to part with earlier than 1870—
   </p>
   
   <p>            By the way I want, both '71 and '72 L of G. but I do not think you have
      them. I have sent
      to McKay<sup><a href="#n4983" id="r4">4</a></sup> for some portraits for Harry Forman<sup><a href="#loc.07037_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> and myself
      and have told McKay when he has them collected to send them over to you to be signed
      and dated. I hope you will kindly do this for me. Is the new portrait for "Autumn
      Boughs"? and are you thinking of bringing that book out soon.<sup><a href="#loc.07037_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup> I hope so. Do not forget that you are to be ready to
      move in <u>May</u> bag &amp; baggage &amp; make your calculations
      accordingly. Mercury fell to zero here this morning, a lovely bright
      morning—good sleighing here now. Remember me very kindly to Mrs Stafford &amp;
      all the family when you see them—Has Harry had his neck attended to yet?<sup><a href="#loc.07037_n6" id="r7">7</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Please send on the book as soon as convenient.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07037_n1">1. The parcel contained
      two sets of proof sheets for <em>After All, Not to Create
         Only</em> and photographs of Whitman. Both copies of the bound proofs are in
      the Charles E. Feinberg Collection (Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.07037_n3">3. William Michael
      Rossetti distributed a facsimile of Whitman's letter to him of , in which the poet thanked his English
      friends for gifts totalling £155. Among those who contributed were Henry
      James and Robert Louis Stevenson.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4983">4. David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="loc.07037_n4">5. Henry "Harry" Buxton
      Forman (1842–1917) was a British man-of-letters, an editor of and
      authority on the works of Keats and Shelley, and, starting in 1887, a
      conspirator in literary forgeries that were exposed after his death. The
      correspondence at this time between Bucke and Forman makes it clear that Bucke
      was also building up Forman's collection of Whitman (D. B. Weldon Library,
      University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07037_n5">6. Traubel brought Whitman
      the first batch of copies of <em>November Boughs</em> for
      distribution to friends on October 4, 1888 (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.82.html">Thursday, October 4, 1888</a>).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="loc.07037_n6">7. Whitman's relations
      with the Stafford family of Kirkwood, New Jersey, especially with Harry
      Stafford, are perceptively described by Miller (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>Walt Whitman: The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 4:2–9). Harry had recently had a throat
      operation. For a summary of Whitman's relationship to the Staffords, see David
      G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
