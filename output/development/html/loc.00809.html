      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am going down in front, in the midst of the Army, to-morrow morning, to be gone
      for about a week<sup><a href="#loc.00809_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—so I thought I would write you a few lines now, to let you know—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I suppose you got my letter written last Tuesday—I have not got any from home
      now for a number of days—I am well &amp; hearty—the young man Lewis Brown is able to be up a little on crutches—there
      are quite a number of sick young men, I have taken in hand, from the late arrivals,
      that I am sorry to leave—sick &amp; downhearted &amp; lonesome, they think so much of a friend,
      &amp; I get so attached to them too—but I want to go down in camp once more very much—&amp;
      I think I shall be back in a week—I shall spend most of my time among the sick &amp; wounded in the Camp
      hospitals—if I had means I should stop with them, poor boys, or go down among them
      periodically, dispensing what I had, as long as the war lasts, down among the worst
      of it—(although what are collected here in hospital, seem to me about as severe and
      needy cases as any after all)—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I want to hear about you all,<sup><a href="#loc.00809_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; about George &amp; how he is spending his time home—Mother, I do hope you are well
      &amp; in good spirits &amp; Jeff &amp; Mat &amp; all, &amp; dear little California &amp; Hattie—I send them
      all my love—Mother, I may write to you from down in front—so good bye, dear mother,
      for present—
   </p>

   <p>I hope I shall find several letters waiting for me when I get back here—</p>
