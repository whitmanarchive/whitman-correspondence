      <br></br><br></br>Dear Dan:<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.02829_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I take an interest in the boy in the office, Harry Stafford—I know his father &amp; mother—There
      is a large family, very respectable American people—farmers, but only a hired farm—Mr.
      Stafford in weak health—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am anxious Harry should <em>learn the printer's trade thoroughly—I want him to learn to set type 
         as fast as possible</em>—want you to give him a chance (less of the mere errands &amp;c)—There is a good deal
      really in the boy, if he has a chance.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Don't say any thing about this note to him—or in fact to any one—just tear it up,
      &amp; <em>keep the matter to yourself private</em>.
      
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02829_n1">1. A copy of <em>Memoranda During the War</em> in the Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection at the Library of Congress is inscribed: "To Dan: Whittaker from
      his friend the Author." Whittaker, a printer, was employed in the office of
      the Camden <em>New Republic</em>, where Harry Stafford was an
      errand boy. (Since Whitman became acquainted with the Staffords in 1876, the
      year appears to be correct.)<br><br>
      When Susan Stafford wrote to Whitman on , she was worried because Harry "left the New Republic office
      in such A hurry at least untill he had another place as he does not like to
      work on A farm. he spoke of getting A situation In the park."<a href="#r1">[back]
