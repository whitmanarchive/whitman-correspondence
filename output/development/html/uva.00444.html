   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00444_n1">1. Probably Whitman met
      George Chainey, the publisher of <em>This World</em> (Boston), in
      Boston in 1881. On December 22, 1881, the poet sent one of Chainey's sermons to
      Susan Stafford (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.). Chainey printed on June 17, 1882, "Keep Off the Grass," a lecture which
      he had delivered on June 11, as well as "To a Common Prostitute." Chainey
      printed Whitman's letter and one from O'Connor on July 1. Interestingly,
      O'Connor deplored Chainey's stupidity in a letter to Whitman on , although he had been furnishing Chainey
      with information; see Chainey's letter to O'Connor, dated July 11 (Trent
      Collection, Duke University). Chainey discussed the censorship on July 1, July
      6, and November 4; see Roger Asselineau, <em>L'Évolution de Walt
         Whitman</em> (1955), 250–251n. Chainey lectured on <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1884 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, June 23).<a href="#r1">[back]
