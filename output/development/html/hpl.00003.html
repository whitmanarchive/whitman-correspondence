   <p>Sir I respectfully ask you to print this communication written to start a public demand
      for the general exchange of prisoners of war.<sup><a href="#hpl.00003_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> As the question now stands, the fault is altogether with our government. I hope you
      will feel to say a word editorialy about it, perhaps call attention in that way to the communication.
   </p>
   
   <p>I solicit that you will find room for it <em>to-morrow morn'g</em> as I have sent this afternoon similar communications to one or two other papers,
      (though this one is different in form &amp; made specialy for the Herald.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="hpl.00003_n2">1. Draft letter.<br><br>
      Between December 26 and 29, 1864, Whitman sent copies of his article "The
      Prisoners" to several newspaper editors, including the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> and the <em>New York
         Times</em>. See Whitman's letters from , and ,
      for similar letters of solicitation to editors.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hpl.00003_n3">2. Whitman's fervor for a
      general exchange of prisoners was born from his inability to effect a special
      exchange for his brother George, who, Whitman had told Ellen M. O'Connor in a
      letter dated , "still remains a
      prisoner—as near as we can judge he is at Columbia, S C—we have had no word from
      him—."<a href="#r2">[back]
