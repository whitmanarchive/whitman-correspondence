   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00624_n11">1. This letter dates to April
      8, 1873. Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the letter the date April 8, 1873, and
      Edwin Haviland Miller agreed (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:212, n. 59; 2:370). April 8, 1873 fell on a Tuesday, the day that Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman indicated she wrote, and the letter acknowledges Walt Whitman's
      "letter of sunday and monday and the papers." Walt had written a letter over the
      course of two days, the Sunday and Monday preceding, and he enclosed with the
      letter a "bundle of papers" (see Walt's  letter to Louisa). Therefore, Bucke's and Miller's date is the
      most probable. However, Louisa's letter seeks Walt's opinion of a letter from
      Josephine Barkeloo. If this letter dates April 8, the request is peculiar
      because Walt had enclosed a letter from Josephine Barkeloo with his  letter to his brother Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman. If Louisa was enquiring about the letter from Barkeloo that
      Walt forwarded on March 30, the date is curious: Louisa had speculated about the
      arrival of Barkeloo's ship in her 
      letter to Walt, so Walt could not have enclosed in his letter to Jeff a letter
      from Barkeloo that Louisa had yet to receive. In this letter, Louisa asks, "walt
      what did you think of Josephenes letter"? One explanation, though contrary to
      Louisa's usual timeliness, is that she delayed asking Walt's opinion for more
      than a week. Another speculative explanation is that Louisa had received two
      different letters from Barkeloo, one at the end of March, which reported
      Josephine's arrival in England, and a second letter, which she enclosed with
      this one, after Barkeloo's arrival in Belgium. Any resolution for this matter
      must remain speculative, but the matter of Barkeloo's letter (or letters) is
      secondary and cannot alone undermine the inferred date of this letter.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00624_n13">2. Walt Whitman had enclosed a
      "bundle of papers" with the letter he wrote the previous Sunday and Monday (see
      his  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman). For the poem that he enclosed, see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00131.html">"Sea Captains, Young or Old,"</a> published in the April 4, 1873 issue of
      the <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_title/per.00107.html"><em>New York Daily Graphic</em></a>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00624_n8">3. Walt Whitman in January 1873
      suffered a paralytic stroke that initially confined him to bed: it took weeks
      before he could resume walking. He first reported the stroke to his mother in
      his  letter. Whitman in his most
      recent letter said that he wrote from the Treasury Department office, but he had
      confined comments on his condition to two brief remarks, that he did "not feel
      very well" and that "My head is still so feeble" (see his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00616_n4">4. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman (1836–1873) died on February 19, 1873 from complications
      associated with a throat ailment that had first been noted by her husband Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in February 1863. Mattie and Jeff had two daughters,
      Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St.
      Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
      emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26. Waldron reports that a physician identified the cause
      of death as cancer (3). Robert Roper has speculated that Mattie's accompanying
      bronchial symptoms may have been associated with tuberculosis (<em>Now the Drum of War</em> [New York: Walker, 2008], 78–79).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00597_n3">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward moved from Brooklyn to
      reside with them in Camden in August 1872. For more information on George, see
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00624_n14">6. The description that
      follows is the most extensive description of the new house that George
      Washington Whitman was building on a corner lot at 431 Stevens Street in Camden,
      New Jersey (see Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975], 31).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00624_n9">7. Walt Whitman had proposed
      building a house for himself, his mother, and his brother Edward Whitman. He
      first speculated—"if you &amp; I had a house here"—as Washington,
      D.C. prepared for Ulysses S. Grant's inauguration (see his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman). And he followed up a week before this letter: "I shall <em>surely</em> get here or buy or build a little place here,
      rooms enough to live in for you &amp; Ed and me" (see his  letter to Louisa).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n6">8. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00624_n2">9. Josephine Barkeloo, a
      young Brooklyn friend of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was the daughter of Tunis S.
      Barkeloo, a clerk (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed.
      Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:209, n. 50). Josephine sailed to Belgium in winter 1872. For her impending
      departure and her hope to "perfect myself in the French and German languages,"
      see Josephine's  letter to Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman (Library of Congress). Based on the phrasing in Louisa's
      letter, it seems most likely that Louisa enclosed a letter from Josephine.
      However, Walt Whitman had enclosed a letter from Josephine Barkeloo with his
       letter to his brother, Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman. Perhaps Louisa's query about Josephine's late-March letter
      was long delayed, or perhaps Louisa referred to a second letter.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n11">10. Helen Price was the
      daughter of Abby and Edmund Price. Abby Price and her family, especially her
      daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman and his mother, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman. Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform
      movements. Price's husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and
      the couple had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in
      1852, at 2 years of age). In 1860, the Price family began to save Walt's
      letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman were included in Richard Maurice
      Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1883), and she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters to
      her mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169).<a href="#r10">[back]

      inverted, in the top margin of the page.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00414_n14">12. Rheumatism or arthritic
      rheumatism, which Louisa Van Velsor Whitman also spells "rheumattis" or
      "rhumatis," is joint pain, which was attributed to dry joints. See <em>Health at Home, or Hall's Family Doctor</em> (Hartford: J. A.
      S. Betts, 1873), 704.<a href="#r12">[back]
