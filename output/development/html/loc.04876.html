   <p>My small colored boy is the bearer of a note to Mr. Rhys,<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      asking him to dine with us at 6.15 this evening, going afterward with me to the
      Thomas Concert<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n5" id="r2">2</a></sup> for which I have tickets.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If Mr. Rhys is not in when the boy reaches your house, will you kindly  send me word by the
      boy, as to the probabilities of his being able to come, as you may perchance know
      his engagements. If he is at any place near, will you send the boy to him with his
      note please. I am sorry to trouble you, but shall be very greatly obliged.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope this cold weather is treating you more kindly than the last.</p>
