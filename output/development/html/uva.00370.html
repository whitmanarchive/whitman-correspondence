   <p>John, I have just been reading your <em>Galaxy</em> article,<sup><a href="#uva.00370_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> seated by the open window front room in my shirt sleeves, &amp;
      must write a word about it—Your late pieces show <em>marked
         vitality—vivacity</em> (struggling, almost chafing, underneath a continent,
      respectable form or exterior) &amp; <em>this is the best of
         them</em>—has those peculiarities, not without one or two foibles, but the <em>whole</em> of the piece is glorious—leaves the impression now upon me
      (after two readings) of the noblest piece of criticism on these things yet in
      America—as much nobler than the superb Emersonian pages on those subjects as lines
      &amp; opinions with <em>the blood of life</em> &amp; throb of hot conviction
      in them, are nobler than the superbest <em>Marble–statue
         lines</em>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It would be possible that I might be swayed into a warm feeling about the piece by
      the
      magnificent &amp; very 'cute page about me,<sup><a href="#uva.00370_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> but as it happens by
      accident I had 
      look'd
      
       over &amp; read the piece in parts, <em>accidentally omitting at
         first the entire lines in the second column</em> of the page about me (which finally
      please me best)—&amp; had made up my mind very decidedly as aforesaid—then when
      I <em>did</em> read them, you can imagine they <em>didn't</em>
      hurt me much—nor my estimation of the piece—<sup><a href="#uva.00370_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have much to write—or tell you—about my own concerns—things in
      England—here too—&amp;c &amp;c—have been waiting for the chance to write
      you fully ever since I got your kind generous note &amp; present<sup><a href="#uva.00370_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—but it 
      dont
      
       seem to occur—Physically I am not much different—get along about as
      well as usual these times—am now just going down to an old farm house &amp; big
      family, down in Jersey at <em>White Horse</em>,<sup><a href="#uva.00370_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> to
      spend a couple of days—and it is now (4½ p m) while I am waiting for the hack to
      come &amp; take me to the depot that I write this—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>George<sup><a href="#n0700" id="r7">7</a></sup> and Lou<sup><a href="#n0696" id="r8">8</a></sup> are well—baby<sup><a href="#n0703" id="r9">9</a></sup> only pretty
      well—hot weather, &amp; teething—(but behaves like a little hero)—expect
      my two nieces<sup><a href="#uva.00370_n7" id="r10">10</a></sup> here next week from St Louis—Love to
      'Sula<sup><a href="#uva.00370_n8" id="r11">11</a></sup>—Write soon—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00370_n1">1. This letter's envelope bears the address,
      "John Burroughs | Esopus-on-Hudson | Ulster Co | New York." It is postmarked:
      "Camden | Jun | 17 | N.J."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00370_n2">2. Burroughs published "A Word or Two on
      Emerson" and "A Final Word on Emerson" in the <em>Galaxy</em> in
      February and April 1876. See also Whitman's  letter to Burroughs.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="uva.00370_n3">3. See the <em>Galaxy</em>, 21
      (February 1876), 258–259.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00370_n4">4. Of Walt Whitman's "overpraise," Burroughs
      remarked in 1907: "I think he must have had a glass of whisky, or some
      champagne, when he wrote that" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1931], 135).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00370_n5">5. On May 10, 1876, Whitman noted receipt of
      $50 from Burroughs (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="uva.00370_n6">6. Walt Whitman did not record in his
      Commonplace Book any visits with the Staffords at this time (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n0700">7. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0696">8. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (d. 1892), called "Loo" or
      "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their son,
      Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second son
      was stillborn. For more on Louisa, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n0703">9. Jessie Louisa Whitman was the daughter of Thomas
      Jefferson ("Jeff") and Martha ("Mattie") Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Jessie and her sister Manahatta ("Hattie") were both favorites of
      their uncle Walt.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00370_n7">10. Mannahatta and Jessie, Jeff's daughters,
      came from St. Louis to Camden in July and remained until October 25, 1876
