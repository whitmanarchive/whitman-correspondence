      <br></br><br></br>Dear Charley,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter came last week, enclosing one from the office. I have just written 
      to the Postmaster at Washington,<sup><a href="#duk.00666_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> asking him to forward my letters here, 
      as I suppose that can be done. How is it? Can it be done—do you know? 
      So you are to leave Washington on Thursday next—&amp; Nelly and Jeannie are also—for a
      New England visit—May it be a pleasant &amp; healthful &amp; happy one for all of you.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In my case there is no notable amendment—&amp; not much change—I have irregular spells
      
      of serious distress, pain &amp;c. in the head, full as bad as ever, sometimes lasting
      all day, 
      &amp; sometimes part of the day or night only, with intervals in which, (while I remain
      still,) 
      I feel comparatively easy—but my locomotion is about as bad as it was—last evening
      I thought it worse than usual—(to-day it is not)—I am not taking any medicine, nor
      have I talked with any doctor since I left W[ashington]—nights &amp; sleep are quite good—appetite
      middling—&amp;c &amp;c.—I still stay here, 
      afraid to go to Atlantic City, or any where, while I am liable every day 
      to these depressing spells—&amp; incapacitated from walking—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have the weather in <em>streaks</em> of hot &amp; cool here—last evening it turned coldish 
      &amp; remains so this forenoon, very bright &amp; pleasant—but we had it very hot here too,
      some days—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>By what I see in the <em>Phil. Ledger</em> and N. Y. Herald<sup><a href="#duk.00666_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Wash[ington] items to-day, I infer that William has rec'd 
      the appointment of C[hief] C[lerk] at which I am <em>truly pleased</em>—Nelly, 
      as I suppose you will see this letter, I will send you my love in it, 
      and you must take this letter the same as if written to you—I wont ask you to write from W. at present in the midst of your preparations—but write me
      from Newport, after you get well rested &amp; settled—did you see Dr. Drinkard? &amp; did
      he say any thing new about my sickness or symptoms?
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have rec'd a letter from John Burroughs to-day—he &amp; wife are evidently having real
      good 
      healthy country times away there in the cool uplands of Delaware county—he is home—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am feeling comparatively comfortable to-day, &amp; still hope for the best—<em>but</em>—Charley, 
      go in to my office a moment, before you go &amp; see if any letters—tell me if William
      is 
      definitely appointed—write very soon from Boston, if not before.
      
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>."

   <p id="duk.00666_n2">2. On July 7, 1873, the New
      York <em>Herald</em> noted: "The Chief Clerkship of the Lighthouse
      Board, now vacant, will, it is said, be filled by the appointment of William D.
      O'Connor, who has for some years past been the corresponding clerk of that
      office and is thoroughly familiar with its details." O'Connor's tenure was
      brief; as of Walt Whitman's  letter to Peter Doyle, O'Connor had "changed to a clerkship in
      the Library, Treasury."<a href="#r2">[back]
