   </p>
   
   <p>I enclose the two books by express, and will write you later. You need not return
      them until called for, if at all.<sup><a href="#loc.03321_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Charley Eldridge sent
      them to me,<sup><a href="#loc.00943_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I don't know yet whether as a gift or a
      loan. So take your time at them. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I find on carefully reading the "Quarterly," that I should greatly qualify my first
      impression of its merits. Still, it is good, and its source  gives it weight, and great
      significance. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I am badly off today, so excuse crudity and brevity. I hope you'll have a comfortable
      Christmas.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03321_n1">1. It is unclear what books
      O'Connor included with his letter, but one appears to be "the New Zealand
      professor's book" that O'Connor described in his letter to Whitman of <a href="syr.00028.html">December 10, 1886</a>. The "professor" is likely
      John Macmillan Brown (1845–1935) of New Zealand's Canterbury College, who
      visited Whitman in 1884. It is unclear what the title of the publication is but
      it was apparently reviewed in London's <em>The Nation</em> in the
      early 1880s.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00943_n2">2. Charles W. Eldridge was
      one half of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge,
      who put out the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In
      December 1862, on his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg,
      Virginia, Walt Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had
      become a clerk in the office of the army paymaster and eventually obtained a
      desk for Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster. For
      more on Whitman's relationship with Thayer and Eldridge see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
