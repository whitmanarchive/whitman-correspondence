      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is impossible for me to write much now, but I want to get a letter off by this
      mail in acknowledgement of your very kind post card to hand this
      morning.—Thanks to you indeed!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yes! I received your portrait "in good order"—and with emotions which I have
      already tried to indicate.—Apart from its existence
      <p>a photo: the last taken half length like the one you have</p> value to me as a gift
      from yourself, I find its <u>intrinsic</u> merit very great
      indeed.—It has "<u>grown</u>" upon me very much, and
      authenticates itself, to my mind, more and more, as a true characteristic portrait.
      Indeed, I am delighted with it. (Certainly, <u>far</u> better
      than the "<u>Illustrated News</u>" one!)
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I wished to carry out your instructions literally, + to put it in place of the other
      in the same frame.—But it did not fit quite satisfactorily so I decided to have a new frame
      made like the old one (plain oak 3" wide) and to use the old frame for something
      else.
   </p>
   
   <p>D<u>r</u> Johnston<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r1">1</a></sup>, too, has had the portrait
      you gave him (of yourself—painted by Sidney Morse) framed, (gold mat + frame)
      and is very pleased with it
   </p>
   
   <p>He called on me at noon today + I shewed him your post card. He is deeply sensible
      of
      your great loving-kindness + your solicitude about him. He has improved in health
      since his return, +
      is, I think, very well now.
   </p>
   
   <p>He kindly brought me, as a present, the two vols. of "<u>Essays</u>" by J. A. Symonds<sup><a href="#n0615" id="r2">2</a></sup> which I have not yet read. I
      have glanced them over + find much to stir my appetite.
   </p>
   
   <p>But I must not write more now.</p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With the deepest love gratitude + reverence to you always, Dr. Johnston
      joining me
      <br></br>I remain
      <br></br>Yours affectionately

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on

   <p id="n0615">2. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
