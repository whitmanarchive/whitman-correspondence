      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Old Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>By this mail I send you the current number of <u>The Strand
         Magazine</u>—a new English periodical—mainly because it contains
      (p. 41) portraits of your old friend Tennyson<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r2">2</a></sup>, at two different
      periods of his life, which I thought might interest you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>J.W.W.<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r3">3</a></sup> called at my Surgery this morning &amp; read to me the
      draft of a letter to you concerning Ruskin<sup><a href="#n3013" id="r4">4</a></sup> which I think will
      please you. This is the most sacred of days to him (JWW), being the anniversary of
      his mother's death, which was at once the greatest calamity of his life &amp; his
      most valuable experience
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>He was just returning from the Cemetery where he had probably been placing a wreath
      upon her grave.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is a constant source of regret to his friends here that his health continues so
      indifferent—he is looking better tho' still complaining of a lack of nerve
      energy—this enforced absence form the Monday night weekly meetings of "The
      College" has been a misfortune for our little society of friends, among whom he is
      <u>facile princeps</u>, &amp; who are proud to acknowledge
      him Master.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"The dear fellow!" you exclaimed while reading the letter from him that I handed to
      you last July in your "Mickle St den". Yes, he is a dear fellow! How dear &amp; how
      good no one knows better than I who am privileged to enjoy his closest personal
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>intimacy—He is a man of Sterling worth &amp; his qualities of mind &amp; heart
      have endeared him to all who really <u>know</u> him—Few men
      possess a better knowledge than he of what is essentially the highest &amp; best in
      Literature, or a more keen &amp; penetrating insight into the heart &amp; meaning of
      the Deliverances of the Great Ones of Earth, the "conscience conserving, God
      inculcting, inspired acheivers" the "powerful &amp; resplendent" poets, scientists
      &amp; seers of the glorious past &amp; the equally &amp; perhaps more glorious
      present.<sup><a href="#loc.02460_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>He is really an all round splendid fellow intellectually &amp; morally—Gifted
      with a mind of a superior order he is endowed with an exalted moral nature &amp; has
      attained true nobility of character.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I cannot tell you all he has been to me or how much</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I owe to his good influence; for he has been one of three good genii of my
      life—the other two being yourself &amp; my own, dear, good old father. I have
      no truer friend—our friendship originated in &amp; has been fused &amp; welded
      into intimate &amp;, I trust, life long cohesion mainly through our mutual love for
      you—and you have no warmer, whole-heart-and-soul-devoted admirer, appreciator
      &amp; lover than he
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pardon my writing thus about my friend but "out of the abundance of the heart the
      mouth speaketh".<sup><a href="#loc.02460_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; I know that my words will need no
      apology to <u>you</u> since it is in great measure thro' you that
      I have learned to appreciate &amp; love such as he.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Jan 21st 91—</p>
   
   
   <p>This morning I recd a p.c. from W Sloane Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r7">7</a></sup>, of which the
      following is a copy:—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Belmont Mass USA</p>
   
   <p>Jan 9 '91</p>
   
   <p>Thank you very much for the delightful poem on Walt W. I read it through with zest.
      Why didnt you come &amp; see me? I like you—yr naïveté—you are
      one of us I can see[.] I had a nice visit w Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r8">8</a></sup> last
      summer. I don't understand all the allusions to a band of you in Bolton[.] What does
      <u>we</u> mean? Send me any good word
   </p>
   
   <p>W.S. Kennedy"</p>
   
   
   <p>The weather here has been very erratic. Yesterday a</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>general thaw seemed to have set in &amp; the ice &amp; snow were rapidly disappearing
      but this morning King Frost returned in all his rigour &amp; donned his ermine robe.
      It has been snowing most of the day &amp; it has not yet (8pm) ceased.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The Curator of the Bolton Museum has just been in to make arrangements for the
      removal of my Sidney Morse<sup><a href="#duk.00863_n3" id="r9">9</a></sup> painting of you to the walls
      of the Exhibition this week
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I trust you are keeping better &amp; are free from pain &amp; distress</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>As it is now close upon mail time I mustn't write more at present</p>
   
   
   <p>With my kindest regards to all your household &amp; with best heart love to
      yourself
   </p>
   
   <p>I remain</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,

   <p id="n0625">2. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6121">3. James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

         </a></p>
   <p id="n3013">4. John Ruskin (1819–1900) was
      one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
      via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
      of ). Ruskin, according to Whitman,
      expressed "<em>worry</em> [...] that [<em>Leaves</em> is] <em>too personal</em>, too emotional,
      launched from the fires of [...] spinal passions, joys, yearnings" (see the
      letter from Whitman to William O'Connor of ). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my
      Ruskin with some qualifications." Still, Ruskin "is not to be made little of: is
      of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.4.html">Thursday, January 24, 1889</a>).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n3039">7. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">8. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00863_n3">9. Sidney H. Morse was a
      self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to 1872,
      editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden many
      times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier bust by
      Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan, <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art, 1850–1920</em>
      (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2006), 57–84; and

         Biography</em> (New York: Vintage Books, 1996), 546–590.<a href="#r9">[back]
