      <br></br><br></br>Dear Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of 11 Oct. has been with me some little while, during wh. my leisure has been of the scantiest.<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r2">2</a></sup> It is so still, &amp; may make me cut this shorter than I shd. like.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You say: "I suppose you got my postals on sending the books to J.A. Rose."<sup><a href="#n0916" id="r3">3</a></sup> To the best of my recollection I never did get these: I am aware however that as
      a matter of fact Rose is in possession of your books, but have not seen him since
      he received them.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I feel ashamed for my
      
      
      
      colleagues the English men of the press that the Editor of the Examiner shd. have failed to pay you his just debt,<sup><a href="#n0038" id="r4">4</a></sup> especially after the 2 or 3 times that I raised the question with him, &amp; he once
      of his own accord with me. He is a man I seldom meet: but I do meet him sometimes,
      &amp;, whenever this may happen next, I shall (if opportunity allows) remind him of his
      obligation, &amp; I trust he may yet attend to it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I posted to the Editor of the Secularist the letter to him wh you enclosed: &amp; herewith I forward his reply. This is all I know of the matter. I
      know a little of the Editor Mr. Foote<sup><a href="#n0238" id="r5">5</a></sup> himself, &amp; shd. be very
      
      
      
      slow to suppose that he was personally in fault. The deep black border of his letter
      marks the recent death of his wife—a Miss Heimann, daughter of old friends of ours.
      Within the last 2 or 3 years she had shown mental excitability of a morbid kind: she
      married Foote 8 or 9 mos. ago I suppose, &amp; recently, say towards end of Septr., "took an overdose of chloral," or in other words committed suicide. I mention these
      matters, not as being relevant to your concerns with Foote, but because I know that
      whatever calls for sympathy finds it in you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your statement that Mrs. Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r6">6</a></sup> had undergone a surgical operation distressed us. You spoke of the trouble as just
      over however, &amp;
      
      
      
      we heartily hope that so it is. Please to give her our affectionate regards &amp; greetings.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I <u>did</u> receive Burroughs's<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r7">7</a></sup> new book. Read carefully thro, with much pleasure, all that he says about you: the rest of the book I have had
      to leave unread as yet, in the press of my many occupations.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>All prosperity to you &amp; the Gilchrists in the coming year. I am glad to read what
      you say of Herbert &amp; Beatrice, &amp; fully credit your praises of them.
   </p>

      Always yours,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03602_n1">1. The envelope for this letter
      is endorsed (by Whitman): W M Rossetti | Dec 17 '77.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">2. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0916">3. James Anderson Rose
      (1819–1890) was a solicitor and collector. William Michael Rosetti wrote
      to Lucy Rossetti on February 26, 1886: "Rose talked to me a goodish deal about
      his books. It seems he has a library of some 10,000 volumes, and has just had
      them catalogued at a cost of £100 or so...Rose says he is solicitor to the
      <em>Globe</em> and <em>Morning Post</em>, as
      well as the <em>Standard</em> (of which last I knew), and has even
      had something to do for the <em>Daily News</em> lately: he must I
      think have well-filled pockets" (James Perrin Warren, <em>Walt
         Whitman's Language Experiment</em>, [College Station, PA: Penn State Press,
      1990], 130 n4).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0038">4. Whitman's article "The American War" appeared in
      the <em>London Examiner</em> on March 18, 1876. In his  letter to William Michael Rossetti,
      Whitman indicated that he had not yet been paid for the piece.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0238">5. George William Foote (1850–1915), a British
      freethinker and secularist, was the author of many pamphlets attacking
      Christianity. Foote did not forward £3 to Whitman. Rossetti mentioned on , that he had called the failure to
      pay to Foote's attention. In his Commonplace Book on February 12, 1878, Whitman
      cited a letter from Foote, who promised to send the sum, which he alleged had
      been stolen by an employee (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). After the
      entry the poet later wrote "<em>fraud</em>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0259">6. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">7. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
