      <br></br><br></br>Dear Son
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter dated 27th has reached me here, &amp; glad to get it—glad to hear you are
      having such good health this summer—as to that spell you speak of, no doubt it was
      the devilish lemonade &amp; cake—I always told you you was too heedless in the eating
      &amp; drinking, (sometimes going without too long, &amp;c)—(I tell you what, Harry, it is
      the <em>stomach, belly</em> &amp; liver that make the principal foundation of all <em>feeling well</em>—with one other thing)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The little piece "Will it Happen"? is real good—stick away at it, dear son—write little
      pieces of your thoughts, or what you see, off-hand, <em>at the time</em>—(that <em>always</em> puts <em>life</em> into 'em)—Keep pegging away<sup><a href="#nyp.00412_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Day before yesterday I spent aboard the great ship <em>Minnesota</em>, (big enough for a thousand people)—it was all very enjoyable—the officers all my
      friends right off—I took dinner with them at a big table in what they call the Ward
      Room—Some splendid young fellows—some jolly old roosters—lots of fun, yarns &amp;c—every
      thing good to eat, &amp; plenty of it—What I liked best though was rowing in the boat
      to &amp; from the ship, man-of-war fashion—(In my last letter in <em>Tribune</em> you will see a ¶ about the <em>Minnesota</em>, my first visit)<sup><a href="#nyp.00412_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I got a letter from my sister yesterday from Camden—all as usual there—Mrs Gilchrist
      was there last Saturday, she said—I suppose Herbert is still with you—I rec'd his letter—he seemed to be having royal times there—Beatrice G[ilchrist] is here—she
      called on me here—Hank, you speak about my not writing oftener—this is the <em>third</em> letter<sup><a href="#nyp.00412_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I have written to you from here, &amp; papers three or four times—Yours of yesterday
      is the <em>second</em> rec'd here from you—<em>let them read this letter if they care to</em>—I shall probably be back last of next week—come up, my darling boy—

   <p>John Burroughs was here last evening—went home this morning—I go about middling—take
      things very easy—am as well as usual—(have some sort o' bad spells, still)—am all
      tann'd &amp; red—wear my gray clothes, (my new suit, pretty good yet)—Al and May<sup><a href="#nyp.00412_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> are well, have grown well &amp; finely, (we three pass a good deal of the time together,
      as we all like each other first rate)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr and Mrs Johnston are now away for some days on account of the death of the latters
      father, Monday last—wish'd me particular to stay till they returned—I have lots of
      visitors—some every day—quite a good many ladies—invitations, dinner parties &amp;c (seldom
      go to them though)—All good for a change, &amp; a little excitement—<em>but I wish I was with you this minute, down by the creek or off in the woods somewhere</em>—I have been here now away since April 9 &amp; every thing &amp; every body has been so loving
      &amp; kind—I have been happy in it all—&amp; yet, Harry, my heart &amp; wishes turn to my old
      friends, (&amp; to old Jersey)—weather fine nearly all the time—I go out in Central Park
      frequently—Harry, give Herbert this enclosed slip<sup><a href="#nyp.00412_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
