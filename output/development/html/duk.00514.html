   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00514_n14">1. This letter dates to
      February 19, 1868. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "wensday 19," and
      Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the month February and year 1868. However, Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman conveys information about the expected death of Ansel Van
      Nostrand's mother "Aunt Fanny." Edwin Haviland Miller, appearing to rely on
      Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver's dating of a letter from Mary Van Nostrand,
      dated Louisa's letter to February 19, 1867 (see <em>Faint Clews
         &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 206–207 and Walt Whitman,
      <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77], 1:378). Mary's letter, however, must date to 1868 both
      because Fanny Van Nostrand died in 1868 and because Mary inquired about Martha
      Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman after her recent departure for St. Louis.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00514_n1">2. Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in
      1840, and they lived in Greenport, Long Island. Mary and Ansel had five
      children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and Mary Isadore ("Minnie"). A
      brief note on Mary's family, and the letter from Mary that Louisa forwards to
      Walt, which, based on the death of Aunt Fanny (see below), dates February 16,
      1868, is reproduced in Gohdes and Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews
         &amp; Indirections</em>, 206–207. For more on the Van Nostrand family,
      see Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975), 10–11.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00514_n2">3. Fanny Van Nostrand "Aunt
      Fanny" was the mother of Ansel Van Nostrand, who married Walt Whitman's younger
      sister Mary. Mary's letter, which should be dated February 16, 1868, reported
      that Ansel's mother Aunt Fanny "cannot live." Louisa also wrote in her  letter that "i have heard nothing
      from aunt fanny i suppos she is living yet." She reported Aunt Fanny's recent
      death in her  letter. The death of
      Fanny Van Nostrand is reported on a genealogy site as having occurred on March
      9, 1868 (see http://www.longislandsurnames.com). For Walt Whitman's remark on
      Aunt Fanny, see his  letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00514_n4">5. John Brown, a tailor, and
      his family boarded in the same house as the Whitmans on Portland Avenue,
      Brooklyn. The relationship between the Browns and the Whitmans was often
      strained, but the Browns remained in the Portland Avenue house for five years.
      For the strained relationship, see Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's  and  letters to Walt Whitman. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman seems however
      to have remained on more cordial terms with the Browns. In her  letter to Walt, after describing a
      visit and dinner with the Browns, she reminded him not to share the fact of her
      visit with Jeff and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman: "if Jeff and matt knew i
      had been to see mrs Brown they would cross me off their books."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00514_n19">6. "Willy" and "Charlee" were
      probably John Brown's sons.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">7. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00467_n1">8. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00514_n7">9. The "stars paper" is
      probably the <em>Washington Star</em>. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      had acknowledged receipt of numerous papers (see her  letter to Walt). Because the date is February 19,
      1868, her use of the term "acquitted" is an error. On February 18, 1868, Radical
      Republican Thaddeus Stevens sought to have the Reconstruction Committee in the
      House of Representatives take up articles of impeachment, an attempt that was
      defeated ("Impeachment Again Defeated,"<em>Brooklyn Daily
         Eagle</em>, February 14, 1868, 3).<a href="#r9">[back]
