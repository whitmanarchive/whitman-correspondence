      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Speed,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I send herewith a copy I have procured of the new edition "Leaves of Grass." The price
      is $3.
   </p>
   
   <p>In the office here every thing goes on much as before you left. Mr. Ashton has been
      home to vote, remaining away three days. He &amp; Mrs. A. are well. He seems to be busy
      preparing for the ensuing term, Supreme Court. Mr. Stanbery is quite popular—he is a still, bland, old fellow,—is much at the President's—has
      left every thing in the office to go on as before.
   </p>
   
   <p>Pleasants, Stitt, &amp;c are well. Andy Kerr is off on leave of absence.<sup><a href="#dar.00003_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>All hands join in sending best esteem &amp; love to you.</p>
   
   <p>We have had an awful rain storm of <em>five days</em>, raining with hardly any intermission. The water is way up on the base-ball grounds
      &amp; on 11th st from the Canal most up to the avenue.
   </p>
   
   <p>Tell Charley that I have not forgotten him—I send him my love, &amp; hope we may meet
      again one these days.
   </p>
   
   <p>To-day there has been quite a rush of Confederate Generals to the office—Gen. Beauregard,
      Gilmore, &amp; three or four others, have had interviews with Mr. Stanbery.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Speed (1812–1887), was appointed
      attorney general by Abraham Lincoln in 1864. He continued to serve under Andrew
      Johnson but resigned in July 1866 due to his opposition to Johnson's
      Reconstruction policies.
