      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I wished to send you a copy of the July No of the Westminster Review containing an
      article by me which attempts a study of one side of your work in literature. I wrote
      to Mr. W. M. Rossetti<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r1">1</a></sup> to enquire for your address &amp; he
      tells me that he has already forwarded a copy to you. But I will not be defrauded
      by
      Mr. Rossetti of the pleasure I had promised  myself &amp; therefore you must accept a
      second copy of the Review (which I post with this letter) &amp; do what you like
      with it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I ought to say that the article expresses very partially the impression which your
      writings have made on me. It keeps, as is obvious, at a single point of view &amp;
      regards only what becomes visible from that point. But also I wrote more cooly than
      I feel because I wanted those, who being ignorant of your writings are perhaps
      prejudiced against them, to say "Here is a cool, judicious, impartial  critic who finds a
      great deal in Whitman—perhaps, after all, we are mistaken." Perhaps this will be
      unsatisfactory to you, &amp; you would prefer that your critic should let the full
      force of your writings appear in his criticism, &amp; attract those who are to be
      attracted, &amp; repel those who are to be repelled, &amp; you may value the power
      of repulsion as well as that of attraction. But so many persons capable of loving
      your work, by some mischance or miscarriage or by some ignorance or removable error
      fail in their approach to you, or do not approach at all.  that I think I am justified in my
      attempt.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You have many readers in Ireland, &amp; those who read do not feel a qualified
      delight in your poems—do not love them by degree, but with an absolute, a personal
      love. We none of us question that yours is the clearest, &amp; sweetest, &amp;
      fullest American voice. We grant as true all that you claim for yourself. And you
      gain steadily among us new readers &amp; lovers.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If you care at all for what I have written it would certainly be a pleasure to hear
      this from yourself. If you do not care for it you will know  that I wished to do better than I
      did.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My fixed residence is 50 Wellington Road,  Dublin, Ireland.</p>
   
   
   <p>My work there is that of Professor of English Literature in the University of Dublin.
      We have lately had a good public lecture in Dublin from a Fellow of Trinity College
      on your poems—R. Y. Tyrrell a man who knows Greek poetry very well,<sup><a href="#n0655" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; who finds it does not interfere with his regard for
      yours. If the lecture should at any time be published  I shall send you a copy.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0522">1. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
