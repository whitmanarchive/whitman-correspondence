      <br></br><br></br>Mr Whitman Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p>It is with shame that I sit down to write you a few lines. I have neglected it so
      long I suppose you thought I had quit forgotten you, but I can asure you my Dear friend such is not the case. I have thought of you verry often. One reason that I have not writen before is I have been shifting about so much since I have been home that if I did
      write you I could scearcely tell where to have you direct to but now I believe I have got settled down for the
      winter. Samuel M Dyer<sup><a href="#tex.00135_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> that got a furlough at the same time I got mine is hear. I spoke to him about writing
      to you. he felt just as I did about [it]. it was so long since we had promissed to write that he felt ashamed to but I hop you will pardon our neglect, and if it
      complys with your will I should be very happy to keep up a coraspandenc
   </p>
   
   <p>Now I will try and give you an account of my journy home Samuel M Dyer and myself started from Washington on the 28th day of July 3 oclock
      pm arrive in Baltimore about 5 pm there we seperated S.M. Dyer took the 9 pm train for Harrisburg I stayed in Baltimore until Thursday
      evening then took the 9 oclock train for Harrisburg arived at H. about 2 oclock the next morning changed cars there fore Pittsburg arrived there
      about noon I went to the Soldiers home and got my dinner and a verry good dinner it was to. I then took the 1-40 pm train I did not chang cars again until I got to Chicago Friday evening I got into a sleeping car at Crestline
      Ohio, arived at Chicago Saterday morning at 8-30. I then thought I would stop there and look up a cousin that I thought
      lived there, but I found he had left here about two months before that so in the evening
      I took the cars again and the next morning I arrived at my uncles at McFarland Station
      I stayd there two weeks, then started for another part to a place called Raymond. there I
      had a good time. last Friday I came and reported at this Hospital. I think I shall
      stay here all winter

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Hugh McFarland, a
      native of England, was orphaned and raised by his uncle and namesake, who also
      gave his name to a town in Wisconsin that he settled. McFarland enlisted in
      Company B of the 5th Wisconsin on May 10, 1861. On May 3, 1863, near Bank's Ford
      after the Second Battle of Fredericksburg, he was shot in the left leg and
      suffered its amputation by enemy surgeons the next dayâ€”his nineteenth birthday.
      He was admitted to Armory Square on June 13 and sent home July 28.
