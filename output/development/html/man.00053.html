      <br></br><br></br>Mr Whitman—
      <br></br>Dear Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your much welcome note some time ago,<sup><a href="#n0844b" id="r1">1</a></sup> but have been so very busy that I
      have not had time to write to you. You cant think how pleased I was to get your
      letter and to learn that you thought of your Jersey friends while so far away from
      us, yet I was sorry to
      to hear that you have been ill I hope when you get this you will
      be enjoying better health. Joe was very sick two or three weeks ago, but is better
      now; and I am enjoying my usual good health. I suppose you wonder what has kept <u>me</u> so busy I will tell you. Lizzie Hider<sup><a href="#nyp.00417_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> has been staying
      with me for two weeks past, and I have had so much sewing to do for Ruth<sup><a href="#n1060" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
      getting ready for festivals, picnics and
      such—that it all has
      kept me very busy but the picnics will soon be over and then I shall not have so
      much to do
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you hear from the Gilchrists<sup><a href="#n3001" id="r4">4</a></sup> often it has been some time since Mother heard from
      them. You spoke of being reminded of me so much up there. I wish I could be there
      for I think I should enjoy a visit up that way very much and particularly this warm
      weather. I think you
       need to be glad you are away in a cool climate this warm weather, for it has been
      almost <u>hot</u> enough to roast a body down here. It is getting late and news is scarce I
      will close
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Write soon again and let us know how you enjoyed your trip up the 
      St. L—
      <br></br>Debbie V. Browning
      <br></br>Haddonfield

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0844b">1. Deborah Stafford was the sister of
      Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. She
      married Joseph Browning. See <em>Daybooks and Notebooks</em>, ed.
      William White (New York: New York University Press, 1978), 1:35. Debbie and
      Harry's parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse
      Farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions.
      For more on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>" <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, ed., (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 685.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00417_n3">2. Lizzie H. Hider was
      shortly to marry Wesley Stafford, Harry's cousin (see the letter from Whitman to
      Susan Stafford of ). They occupied
      the former home of Susan and George Stafford (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1060">3. One of Harry Stafford's sisters
      (1866–1939), later Ruth Stafford Goldy.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3001">4. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885), widow to Alexander Gilchrist, and her four children Beatrice,
      Grace, Percy and Herbert. Anne Gilchrist wrote one of the first significant
      pieces of criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's
      Estimate of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M.
      Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59.
      Gilchrist's long correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in
      love with the poet after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she
      visited Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. Anne's son Herbert (1857–1914) was
      a painter and shared his mother's fascination for Whitman. For more on Whitman
      and the Gilchrists, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
