      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>You will get a copious shower (Dr B[ucke] and me together) of these pestering
      messages. I have been looking through the G[ood] G[ray] P[oet] as Dr B sent it in
      his copy, &amp; it comes to my soul over the dozen years more eloquent &amp;
      beautiful than ever—seems to me, (as a passionate shooting shaft launched into
      those times, &amp; indeed fitting to the whole situation then &amp; since)—<em>it deserves to stand just as it is</em>—two passages in the
      last page only might be left out, &amp; I should so suggest.<sup><a href="#nyp.00475_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Seems to me all that is wanted is a brief preparatory
      ¶ dated present time, <em>distinctly confirming your faith
         &amp;c</em>. that it is without diminution (it couldn't have "increase")<sup><a href="#nyp.00475_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—<em>Tomorrow &amp; next day the
         printers will be waiting for the copy</em>. It is intended to put the copy,
      whole book, in hand in force, &amp; have it out soon—Send to me
      here—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am pretty well this ending winter. Yes I rec'd the big Powell <em>Ethnology</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00475_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; have made more than one <em>courageous</em> attack on it (thought I acknowledged it)—The
      air here (human &amp; other) all nervous from the pouring crowds of big disasters,
      floods, mine cavings, deaths, wrecks, big casualties from every quarter—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00475_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd Feb 20/83." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service Bureau
      | Treasury | Washington D C. It is postmarked: Philadelphia | Pa. | Feb 19 83 |
      (?); Washington, Recd. | Feb | 20 | 4 30 AM | 1883 | 2.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00475_n2">2. In his reply on  O'Connor stated that although he wanted
      to delete the passages mentioned, he was in a "dilemma," since they were singled
      out for censure by his critics when the pamphlet appeared in 1866. For this
      reason he thought no deletions should be made (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906],
      1:351).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00475_n3">3. O'Connor, who had
      Olympian contempt for brevity, added more than a paragraph—a letter of
      twenty-five pages.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00475_n4">4. Perhaps an unidentified
      work by Frederick York Powell (1850–1904), Froude's successor at Oxford,
      who wrote an eulogistic letter to Whitman on November 1, 1884 (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection; Traubel, 1:356–357).<a href="#r4">[back]
