   <p>I just send Kennedy's<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r1">1</a></sup> letter &amp; write on it what suggests to
      me impromptu—Yes I am making calculation on a conveniently plann'd &amp; built
      house, &amp; garden, of my own (cheap &amp; democratic) either in the woods, or in
      sight of the sea, where I can haul in &amp; breathe a sane atmosphere, &amp; be
      secure like, either for the summers, or all the time yet vouchsafed to me. I think
      it would be best to get all the money-fund<sup><a href="#prc.00121_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> in Mrs.
      F's,<sup><a href="#har.00049_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> O'Reilly's,<sup><a href="#n4973" id="r4">4</a></sup> K's &amp; your
      hands (&amp; any others if any others there be)—putting it in a draught
      payable to my order &amp; send it to me here—I feel as if I could suit my
      wants &amp; tastes better probably deciding &amp; directing the practicality of the
      whole thing <u>myself</u>—(I am sure you will all
      understand it.) Show this to Mrs. F and O'R—I wish them to know too how
      appreciatingly &amp; gratefully I feel ab't their help—&amp; that I appoint
      you to fully act as my representative &amp; (if need be) <u>receiver</u> in the matter.<sup><a href="#bpl.00013_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>As I write I am sitting here by the open window—Birds singing &amp; fine
      weather—but <u>hot</u>—Herbert Gilchrist,<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r6">6</a></sup> of England, is here painting a portrait of me to take to

   <p>PS.</p>
   
   <p>I have a shrewd guess that you intend to sell or rent yr present house, &amp;
      build or bring the new one on the Long Island shore. But I shant impart my
      surmise to any one else. How happy I shall be to come &amp; see you when you are
      in the <u>new house</u>! Egad, think of that, man,—the
      new house, I mean. Mrs F. has just sent in some <u>plans</u>
      for a building. They don't seem to know that you are a house builder.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3039">1. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="prc.00121_n3">2. Boston friends were
      raising money to buy a summer cottage they hoped would improve Whitman's failing
      health. Whitman eventually used the money to build his extravagant mausoleum in
      Harleigh Cemetery—to the shock and dismay of those who had worked hardest
      to solicit money.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="har.00049_n3">3. Elizabeth Fairchild was
      the wife of Colonel Charles Fairchild, the president of a paper company, to whom
      Whitman sent the Centennial Edition on March 2, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). He mailed her husband a
      copy of <em>Progress</em> in April, 1881, shortly after his visit
      to Boston, where he probably met the Fairchilds for the first time (Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4973">4. John Boyle O'Reilly
      (1844–1890) was a fervent Irish patriot who joined the British Army in
      order to sabotage it. He was arrested and sentenced to be hanged in 1866. Later
      the decree was altered, and O'Reilly was sent to Australia, where he escaped on
      an American whaler in 1869. In 1876 he became the coeditor of the Boston <em>Pilot</em>, a position which he held until his death in 1890.
      See William G. Schofield, <em>Seek for a Hero: The Story of John
         Boyle O'Reilly</em> (New York: Kennedy, 1956). For more on O'Reilly, see

      complete freedom in the expenditure of the funds, and enclosed a check for $373.
      Whitman's letter was written on the verso of one from William Sloane Kennedy
      dated .<a href="#r5">[back]
