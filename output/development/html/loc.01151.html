      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have set my house &amp; heart in order for a visit from you before these May days
      are ended. I trust you are well &amp; really mean to come. Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r1">1</a></sup> wrote me he should be here early in June to take you with him
      to Ontario. I want you for 10 days or two weeks before he comes. Can you  not come the
      latter part of this week or early next? If you do not like to make the whole
      distance alone, I will meet you in Jersey City. Your best train to come by is the
      one that leaves J.C. a little before 4 p.m. &amp; gets here at West Park at 6.45
      The train leaves from the same depot (The Pennsylvania) you come in at.
   </p>
   
   <p>You would enjoy the country here now, &amp; it would add to the length of my days to
      see you here again.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Drop me a line how you feel, &amp; when you will come. Ursula<sup><a href="#n0892" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      &amp; Julian<sup><a href="#loc.01151_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> both want to see you.<sup><a href="#loc.01151_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

      September 12, 1857. The couple maintained a small farm overlooking the Hudson
      River in West Park, Ulster County. They adopted a son, Julian, at two months of
