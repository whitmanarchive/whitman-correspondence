   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07706_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario Canada. It is postmarked: Camden, NJ | Oct

   <p id="n3115">2. Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935)
      was a translator and poet from France, who commented positively not only on
      Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and
      apparently liked the critic's work on <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>—Whitman even had Sarrazin's chapter on his book translated
      twice. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6181">3. Whitman is referring to Gabriel
      Sarrazin's "Poetes modernes de l'Amerique, Walt Whitman," which appeared in <em>La Nouvelle Revue</em>, 52 (May 1, 1888), 164–184.
      Whitman had asked both William Sloane Kennedy and Richard Maurice Bucke to make
      an abstract in English of it (see Whitman's letter to Kennedy of , and to Bucke of ). Sarrazin's piece is reprinted in
      an English translation by Harrison S. Morris in <em>In Re Walt
         Whitman</em>, ed. Horace L. Traubel, Richard Maurice Bucke, and Thomas B.
      Harned (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1893), 159–194.<a href="#r3">[back]
