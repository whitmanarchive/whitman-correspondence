   <p>I see, my dearest Friend, I must not look for those dashes under the words I thought
      were going to convey a joyful confirmation of my hopes. I see how the dark clouds
      linger. Full of pain &amp; indignation. I read the paragraph—but fuller still
      of yearning tenderness &amp; trust and hope. I believe my dear love that what you
      need to help on your recovery is a  woman's tender cherishing love and care and that in that warm
      genial atmosphere the spring of life will be quickened once more and flow full and
      strong through all its channels as of old, gradually, not quickly, even so. I dare
      say: but with plenty of patience; with utmost intelligent care of all conditions
      favourable to health, of diet, of abundant oxygen in the rooms you inhabit, of as
      much  outdoor life as
      possible, of happy cheerful companionship &amp; all the homely everyday domestic
      joys which are so healthful  in their influences.

   <p>America is doing what nations in all times have done towards that which is profoundly
      new &amp; great, that which discredits their old ideals and offers them strange
      fruits &amp; flowers from another world than that they have been content to  dwell in all their
      lives. But for all that, I do not believe the precious seed is lying dormant even
      now—everywhere a few in whose hearts it is treasured &amp; yields a noble
      growth. Since it is America that has produced you nourished your soul and body, she
      is silently unnoticed producing men &amp; women who will justify you, who will
      understand the meaning of all and respond with  a love that will quicken &amp; exalt
      humanity as Christ's influence once did. Still it is inscrutable to me that the
      heart of America is not now passionately drawn toward the great heart that beats
      &amp; glows in these Poems—that Drum Taps, at any rate are not as dear to her
      as the memory of her dead heroes sons brothers husbands. It must be that they really
      do not reach the hands of the American people at large—that the professedly
      literary cultivated class  asking for nothing better than the pretty sing song
      sentimentalities which "join them in their nonsense," or else slavishly prostrating
      their judgments before the models of the past (so perfect for their day, so wholly
      inadequate for ours) raise their voices so loud in news papers &amp; magazines as to
      prevent or everywhere check the circulation

   <p>Jan. 1. The New Year has come in bleakly &amp;
      keenly—to the inner as well as to the outer sense, with the papers full of the
      details of the dark fate of the emigrant ship &amp; of the terrible railway
      accidents.
      Percy was not able to join us at Xmas (through
      business,) but I am expecting him tonight. My mother bears up against the cold
      wonderfully—&amp; even continues to go out in her chair—so Bee's letters are very bright
      &amp; cheerful—she &amp; indeed all my children enjoy the cold  much provided they
      have plenty of outdoor exercise—above all skating, which they are now
      enjoying. I too like it, but am so haunted by the thought of the increased misery
      it
      brings to our hundreds of thousands of ill fed ill clothed ill housed.—I trust
      the family circle round you &amp; your nieces at St. Louis, &amp; all near &amp; dear to you are well, and
      that you have felt the warm grasp of many loving friends this wintry cloudy time my
      dearest—and that there may breathe out of these poor words a warm bright glow
      of love and hope &amp; [

      trust in the future.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
