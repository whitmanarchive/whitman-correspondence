      <br></br><br></br>Dear Madam<sup xmlns=""><a href="#prc.00007_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
       
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your generous remittance of $75 for the wounded &amp; sick was duly received by letter
      of 21st &amp; is most acceptable. So much good may be done with it. A little I find may
      go a great ways. It is perhaps like having a store of medicines—the difficulty is
      not so much in getting the medicines, it is not so important about having a great
      store, as it is important to apply them by rare perception, honest personal investigation,
      true love, &amp; if possible the inspiration &amp; tact we in other fields call genius.
   </p>
   
   <p>The hospitals here are again full, as nearly all last week trains were arriving off
      &amp; on from front with sick. Very many of these however will be transferred north as
      soon as practicable.
   </p>
   
   <p>Unfortunately large numbers are irreparably injured in these jolting railroad &amp; ambulance
      journeys, numbers dying on the road.—Of these come in lately, diarrhea, rheumatism
      &amp; the old camp fevers are most prevalent. The wrecks in these forms of so many hundreds
      of dear young American men come in lately, are terrible, &amp; make one's heart ache.
   </p>
   
   <p>Numerically the sick are the last four or five weeks becoming alarmingly greater,
      &amp; in quality the cases grow more intense. I have noticed a steady deepening of this
      intensity of the cases of sickness, the year &amp; a half I have been with the soldiers.
      Hospital accommodations here are being extensively added to. Large tents are being
      put up, &amp; others got ready.
   </p>
   
   <p>My friend, you must accept the men's thanks, through me. I shall remain here among
      the soldiers in hospital through the summer, with short excursions down in field,
      &amp; what help you can send me for the wounded &amp; sick I need hardly say how gladly I
      shall receive it &amp; apply it personally to them.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00007_n1">1. Lucia Jane Russell
      Briggs, the wife of the pastor of the First Parish Church in Salem,
      Massachusetts, heard of Whitman's work in the Washington hospitals through her
      brother, Dr. LeBaron Russell. (For information on Russell, see footnote 2 to
      Whitman's letter to him from .)
      
      In her letter of  Mrs Briggs wrote:
      "I inclose seventy-five dollars, which I have collected among a few friends in
      Salem, and which I hope may be of some little service to our brave boys, who
      surely should not suffer while we have the power to help them. You have our
      warmest sympathy in your generous work, and though sad to witness so much
      suffering, it is indeed a privilege to be able to do something to alleviate it"
      (Hanley; Donaldson, 151–52; Dedmond, 546).<a href="#r1">[back]
