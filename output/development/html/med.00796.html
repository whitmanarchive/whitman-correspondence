   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

   <p id="med.00796_n2">2. Whitman first delivered this
      lecture in New York in 1879 and would deliver it at least eight other times over
      the succeeding years, delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He had
      published a version of the lecture as "Death of Abraham Lincoln" in <em>Specimen Days</em> (1882-83). For more on the lecture, see
      Larry D. Griffin, "'Death of Abraham Lincoln,'" <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="loc.03310_n1">3. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
