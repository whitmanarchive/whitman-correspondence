      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I could not resist the inclination to write to you this morning it seems more than
      a
      week since 
      i
      
       saw you there is hardly anything of interest transpired since you went
      away except occasionaly some one inquires for the <em>Major</em>, or
      the <em>General</em> or some familiar name which no doubt which you
      have heard so often Dear Walt I have examined that book (Pollards History) and 
      i
      
       am 
      Very
      
       much displeased with it 
      i
      
       find it is quite the opposite from what 
      i
      
       was led to believe 
      i
      
       thought it mentioned the movements of the different 
      companys
      
       &amp; Regiments 
      i
      
       am sorry that 
      i
      
       made such a mistake because the Book is of no interest to me
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>
      inclosed
      
       you will find somemthing from this mornings 
      Cronicle
      
       it seems the Washington Papers has you right for once 
      i
      
       am very impatient to hear from you to know that you are doing well Dave
      &amp; all the rest of the Rail Road boys is well &amp; sends their best respects
      mother had a very sick headache when 
      i
      
       left home this morning 
      i
      
       have to cut this short as 
      i
      
       write a part of it while the car is in motion
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843â€“1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
