      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, I suppose you have the hot weather too—it has been very hot here for the last
      four or five days, but I have got along very well—I think of you every day, with the
      work &amp; the heat, &amp;c.—I believe you said that it was good air around there in Pacific
      st., well I should think that was one great advantage over Portland av. any how. Mother,
      I rec'd your letter of last week—I do not go much to the hospital this hot weather—I
      think I feel better than usual now for a couple of weeks past—if I can only get through
      the summer as well as I am, I shall be satisfied—Mrs. Grayson gives me plenty of good
      vegetables, peas, string beans, squash &amp; new potatoes, with fruit now &amp; then, which
      is better than too much meat—Old Mrs. Mix<sup><a href="#duk.00381_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> is well as usual—the house is very pleasant this weather—as cool as it can be any
      where—
   </p>
   
   <p>I should like to hear from Han,<sup><a href="#duk.00381_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> but I suppose she is getting along in the same old way—As I am writing this letter
      at my table, the celebrated Mrs. Cobb<sup><a href="#duk.00381_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> has just come in, to see about some rebel pardon, some profitable job for her, I
      suppose—she is a great piece—she is what most people would call a very pretty little
      woman—dresses gay, &amp;c—but she has too brazen &amp; silly a way, ever to be taken for a
      lady by any one that knows—she has got lots of pardons, &amp; probably made a fortune—is
      half the time at the President's—is not a good character. This Washington is a great
      place—you see how funny the world is governed—&amp; lots of queer doings that outsiders
      never dream of—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, mother, my new shirts are done, half a dozen, very satisfactory—I havn't bought
      any new clothes this summer except a new hat, a big brim, light drab—makes me look
      like a southern planter, but is very light &amp; comfortable—Mother, I wish you could
      sit here by the window I have so often mentioned, &amp; have the cool breeze blow on you,
      as it is now, &amp; the trees &amp; river &amp; hills beyond, so pleasant—
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear mother, you must try to take things moderate—because folks that worry &amp; overdo
      are apt to get the cholera, you know—I hope brother Jeff feels all right again<sup><a href="#duk.00381_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—how I should like to see him, &amp; all of you.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00381_n1">1. Mrs. Edward B. Grayson,
      468 M North, took in boarders. Her mother, Mrs. Mary Mix, a widow, lived with
      her. Mrs. Grayson died on January 7, 1867; see "Letter from Walt Whitman to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 15 January 1867" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York, North Carolina: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 1:306–308). After her daughter's death,
      Mrs. Mix left Washington; see Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from
      January 29, 1867 (Miller, <em>Correspondence</em>,
      1:311–312).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00381_n2">2. Hannah Louisa Whitman
      Heyde (1823–1908), sister of Walt Whitman and wife of Charles Heyde.
      Hannah and Charles lived in Burlington, Vermont.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00381_n3">3. Lucy Livingston Cobb
      became notorious when she brought a court action against General La Fayette C.
      Baker, chief of the National Detective Police, who ordered her arrested for her
      dealings in the pardons racket. Baker, who was no friend of Johnson, implied
      that she was intimate with the President. Baker defended his actions at length
      in <em>History of the United States Secret Service</em>
      (Philadelphia: L. C. Baker, 1867), 589–693; but see also Hugh McCulloch,
      <em>Men and Measures of Half a Century</em> (New York: Charles
      Scriber's Sons, 1887), 393–394.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00381_n4">4. On June 7, 1866, Mrs.
      Whitman reported that "Jeff looks bad, he dont complain but i think he ought to
      have a month of leave from all cares" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke
      University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library).<a href="#r4">[back]
