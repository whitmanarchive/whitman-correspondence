      Draft letter.<br><br>
      After the first printing of the 1876 edition was exhausted, there was a delay
      until Whitman had 600 additional copies printed (see Whitman's  letter to William Michael
      Rossetti). This note undoubtedly was the draft of a letter which Whitman
      sent to those people who had to wait for the second printing.<a href="#r1">[back]
