      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours I received yesterday &nbsp;I also had a lettr from Mat to-day<sup><a href="#loc.00444_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &nbsp;As you can imagine I am very glad to get news from home—I was glad you sent me Mothers
      letter—
   </p>
   
   <p>In regard to the house I think too that it is far better to do as you propose and
      build on George's lot—twill be a home and a good one too I think for Mother<sup><a href="#loc.00444_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I see from Matts letter that they are going to be turned out from their place there—that
      Olmstead<sup><a href="#loc.00444_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> and all the rest are a mean set of cusses as ever lived—there is no need of their
      wanting the house
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hav'nt written to Kingsly<sup><a href="#loc.00444_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> yet—am thinking of perhaps some other way of raising the money—anyway I am pretty
      sure—indeed <em>am</em> sure that it can be had—how soon will you want it? write me about it—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad you went home<sup><a href="#loc.00444_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &nbsp;I guess it did Mother and all of them a great deal of good—Mat writes that she is
      going out to hire rooms as soon as she can &nbsp;It seems to me d—m mean that they manage
      to want the whole of that big house &nbsp;It looks more like being a little ugly than anything
      else—I wish Mattie would be a little stiff with them—the Bullards<sup><a href="#loc.00444_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> I mean the people that are going to move in—the d—m cusses shant have my water pipe unless the[y] behave decent—yet I suppose the Park people are
      mean enough to prevent my taking it up—
   </p>
   
   <p>Matters are beginning to get into shape with me—I am in need of Davis<sup><a href="#loc.00444_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> very much—I have been urging him to come as soon as possible but received a letter
      to-day saying that he could not possibly get here before the 15th of June if then—I
      hope however that he will certainly get here by that time.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr Kirkwood<sup><a href="#loc.00444_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> left me this morning—he has been here since Saturday—The Board of Commis[sio]ners
      I like very much—they do just whatever I ask—at once—indeed almost too much so.<sup><a href="#loc.00444_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> I begin to feel as if I should get along if I have decent luck—Yet it is hard to
      say what will turn up—
   </p>
   
   <p>I manage to get the N. York papers pretty regularly now. I had the Times of Friday
      while eating my Breakfast on Sunday—that is pretty well isnt it. The weather is quite cool—but nevertheless vegetation is getting forward fast—and
      just out side the city—where we are to build part of our new works, matters look perfectly
      beautiful. I hope you will be able to come on here and make me a visit if I stay here
      long—I begin to like the city better—Yet it dont come up to B[rooklyn] by a long chalk—
   </p>
   
   <p>Give my regards to Mr and Mrs O'Connor<sup><a href="#loc.00444_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup>—write me as often as you can

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00444_n100">1. In his previous letter to
      Walt, Jeff indicated that everything was "going abt as usual," an innocuous
      phrase which hid the frustrations of his life. His career had stagnated, money
      was short, and he was still living at home. His mother thought he looked "bad"
      and needed "a month of leave from all cares and anxieties"; she noted, too, that
      he suffered "nervous spells sometimes and is quite moody" (Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman to Walt Whitman, June 7, 1866, and January 17, 1867 [Trent Collection,
      William R. Perkins Library, Duke University]). Jeff's depression must have
      worsened on March 15, 1867, when he attended the funeral of his good friend Dr.
      Edward Ruggles, whose absence he would long lament (see ).In the
      month following this low point, Jeff's life changed abruptly. On March 26,
      James P. Kirkwood, his former boss in Brooklyn, recommended that Jeff
      replace him as chief engineer of the new St. Louis Water Works, a system
      Kirkwood had designed for the state Board of Water Commissioners and the
      city council. By April an offer had been made and Jeff discussed it with
      William Douglas O'Connor. O'Connor quickly relayed this information to Walt
      who urged his brother "to accept the offer, &amp; go, by all means" (Edwin
      Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961-77], 1:326).<br><br>Jeff reported for work in
      St. Louis on May 7, 1867. He was initially uncertain whether this would be a
      permanent move: he left Mattie and the children in the East and asked Walt
      to visit only "if I stay here long." But he liked the energetic young city,
      the companionship of prominent men like Henry Flad, the excitement of a
      large project, and the improved salary—in Brooklyn he made two hundred
      dollars per month, in St. Louis three hundred and thirty. Quickly he assumed
      the responsibilities that would dominate the next twenty years of his life,
      the task of building and supervising a waterworks as extensive as that in
      Brooklyn.<br><br>The plans called for drawing muddy water from the
      Mississippi, allowing it to settle in reservoirs, and then pumping it into a
      sprawling distribution system. Partly because the city council had rejected
      Kirkwood's original location for the works and insisted on a less expensive
      site nearer the city, Jeff was plagued with such problems as poor soil for
      foundations and periodic flooding from the river. By drawing freely on the
      expertise of his old friend Joseph P. Davis and the government publications
      sent him by William Douglas O'Connor, he overcame these obstacles and
      completed the job on schedule in 1871.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00444_n3">3. Once Jeff left Brooklyn
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's domestic arrangements became a matter of concern.
      The long-range plan was for George to build her a home.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.00444_n6">6. Walt Whitman returned
      home on May 4 mainly, it appears, to calm Louisa Van Velsor Whitman who was
      alarmed over George's health (a case of malignant erysipelas) and Mattie's
      impulsive decision to sell furniture and spend the money on clothes (<em>Correspondence</em>, I, 328).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="loc.00444_n10">10. On May 17 Jeff had
      urged the Board of Water Commissioners to construct a temporary reservoir on
      Gamble Street to store water while sediment was removed from the main reservoir
      on Benton Street. This plan was immediately adopted.<a href="#r10">[back]
