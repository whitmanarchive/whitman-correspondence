   <p>Well, mother dear, here I sit again in the rocking chair by the stove—
      I have just eat some dinner, a little piece of fowl &amp; some toast &amp; tea—
      my appetite is good enough—&amp; I have plenty brought to me—I have been 
      sitting up all day—have some bad spells, but am decidedly gaining upon the whole—
      think I have fully recovered where I was a week ago, and even a little better—
      went down stairs yesterday and out for five minutes into the street—
      &amp; shall do so again this afternoon—as I think it did me good yesterday—
      though I was very tired, on returning—as I have to go down &amp; up 4 flights of stairs—
      The doctor comes every day—(I must tell you again I have a first-rate doctor—
      I think he understands my case exactly—I consider myself very lucky in having him)<sup><a href="#nyp.00310_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, yesterday was a very serious day with me here—I was not so very sick, 
      but I kept thinking all the time it was the day of Matty's funeral—
      Every few minutes all day it would come up in my mind—I suppose 
      it was the same with you—Mother, your letter came Friday afternoon—
      it was a very good letter, &amp; after reading it twice, I enclosed it 
      in one to Han—she must have got it Saturday night—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There are great preparations here for 4th of March—inauguration—
      if you &amp; I had a house here,<sup><a href="#nyp.00310_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> we would have George &amp; Lou come on &amp; see the show, 
      for I have no doubt it will be the finest ever seen here—(but I am 
      in hopes to be able to get away for all that)—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>½ past 4.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I have just been down &amp; out doors—walked half a block—&amp; have come back—
      <em>went all alone</em>—(got a little assistance at the steps)—this is the most 
      successful raid yet—&amp; I really begin to feel something like myself—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Hope this will find you all right, dearest Mother—
      <br></br>Walt.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00310_n2">1. Sixteen years later Walt
      Whitman still considered Drinkard "the best Doctor that ever was": he "seemed to
      understand me well: he charged it to the emotional disturbances to which I was
      subjected at that time" (Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.71.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996], 4:472). Also
      note Dr. Matthew Grier's opinion in Whitman's  letter to Ellen M. O'Connor.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00310_n3">2. Around this remark Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman was to construct a dream-house: annoyed by George's
      economizing and, more important, loath to accept a (rightful) secondary position
      in her daughter-in-law's household, Walt Whitman's mother despite her years
      hoped for a home of her own. As early as October 9, 1872, hardly six weeks after
      she had moved to Camden, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman complained to Helen Price: "i
      would rather have my own shanty and my good friends come to see me" (Pierpont
      Morgan Library). Even more significant, she wrote to the same friend on April
      18(?), 1873: "i 
      wouldent
      
       mind living here if i had a place of my own but this living with and
      not being boss of your own shanty aint the cheese" (Pierpont Morgan Library).
      Walt Whitman himself referred to the possibility of purchasing a house in
      Washington; see his  letter to
      Mannahatta Whitman and his , and
       letters to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
