      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I did not get your letter of September 27th till I was leaving for New England, and
      today I have yours of October 4th, which Nelly sends me.
   </p>
   
   <p>I felt so miserably unwell that I decided to try a vacation, and left Washington on
      the 30th of September for Providence, intending to come down at once here to the
      island of 
      Conauient
      
      , opposite Newport, where I now am. But a severe cold, and a week of
      [
      <span class="unclear">unsettled?</span>]
       and
      stormy weather delayed me in Providence till the 6th, when  I arrived here. I intended to stay at
      the Light House on the end of the island (Beaver Tail L.H.) but the keeper could not
      accommodate me, so I am boarding with a private family.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My purpose was to kill two birds with one stone—get well and fix up the
      "Carpenter", but I fear neither are likely to be effected. I feel wretchedly unwell,
      and can't think of composition. I never was so <u>tired</u> in my
      life, and am so sleepy that I drop off in slumber if I sit a few minutes in a
      chair—a new experience for me. I slept twelve hours last night, and after
      dinner today (one o'clock) fell asleep in a rocking chair  and slept till six! I never felt such
      lethargy. I expect some day I shall fall asleep like Rip Van Winkle or (more
      appropriately) the Sleeping Beauty, and my beard grow down all over the rocks like
      sea-weed, and cover the sea, and my hair spread backward over the island, and
      smother the inhabitants. [
      <span class="unclear">Selah.?</span>]
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall probably leave here by the first of next week. I intended to stay longer,
      but
      it is dull and lonely to me, not feeling able to occupy myself with writing, and the
      beauty of the sea is half-lost and indifferent to my sick eyes. My only pleasure is
      a daily delicious  swim
      in the ocean—all too-brief, for the water is too cold to stay in
      long—but oh, how good it is! It electrifies and braces me for a few minutes,
      but then I got dull and sleepy again.
   </p>
   
   <p>So far, thanks to not feeling well, I haven't had a good time at all.</p>
   
   <p>Dear Walt, I hope you will come to Providence. Dr. Channing and Jeannie quite count
      upon it, and will be much gratified. I hope you will be there while I am, and then
      we can go around. I shall return there about the 12th or 13th, and if you fulfil
      your original intention, that will about bring us together at that time.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am glad you are going to send to Freiligrath. I will do my part, eagerly, though
      I
      think I had better wait a few days now, hoping to feel better, and therefore in a
      better mood. Perhaps, I had better wait till I see you in Providence, if you decide
      to come on there, and then we can talk it over, and arrange just what is best to
      say.
   </p>
   
   <p>Swinton's discovery of the resemblance in form between Leaves of Grass and Blake's
      poetry, is in my humble opinion, a mare's nest of the first water. (Irish!!) The
      resemblance is extremely superficial—about as much as  between the Gregorian chant, bellowed by
      bull-necked priests with donkey lips, and a first-class, infinitely varied,
      complex-melodied Galian opera, sung by voices half-human, half-divine. Such
      assertions as Swinton's exasperate me. All that resides in the matter is just this:
      Bishop South had translated the Hebrew prophets into verse of unequal length,
      following the original, whose metres are interior, the accords being of sense and
      not sound, and <u>this, as regards mere external form, Blake
         imitated undoubtedly</u>. The verse of Leaves of Grass has just so much
      superficial resemblance to Bishop South's translations, and the imitations of  Blake, as results from
      their all being <u>unequal in length</u>, and no more. For my
      part, I should as soon think of the form of Leaves of Grass in connexion with that
      of Southey's Thalaba, as with anything of the South-Blake pattern. It differs
      radically and palpably to the eye, to the ear, and above all to the mind, from
      anything before it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Swinton's item in the Times was good. Nelly sends it to me copied into the Star. By
      the way, I put the item into the <u>Star</u> about the price paid
      for "Whispers of Heavenly Death": It made a great sensation in Washington, and your
      stock went up enormously. The 
      <u>Chronicle</u> copied it next day, or rather [
      <span class="unclear">transmogrified?</span>]
       it into an item
      of its own, making the amount twenty five [
      <span class="unclear">guineas?</span>]
       a page,
      or two hundred and fifty dollars, in which pleasing form it is going the rounds, to
      your great honor, and glory, nothing appealing to the 
      esthetic
      
       American mind so much as a success in dollars.
   </p>
   
   <p>I meant to have sent you the item, but forgot. I have saved it for you to see.</p>
   
   <p>That indescribable serpent, George Alfred Townsend, has published an abominably
      flippant and insulting article about you,  which I brought with me, in case we met,
      for you to see. My indignation was intense when I read it, and I don't understand
      how a man can write such things at all, much less about a person with whom he
      pretends to be on friendly terms. I think you must spear him with a look when you
      next meet him, as you did Tilton. He needs reducing to his lowest denominator.
   </p>
   
   <p>I left in such a hurry of preparation, that I did not see John Burroughs, so must
      keep your messages for him till I return.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad your dear mamma is in better quarters than before. It is a great thing,
       though many might not
      think so, to be comfortably housed. Especially must it be so to one advanced in
      years, as she is. Give her my best love.
   </p>
   
   <p>It was so long before I heard from you after I had written, that I thought you must
      be out of town, and thought of commencing another letter to you with "My dear
      Romeo"!!! If you wonder "why Romeo?" I can only answer, demurely, because you may
      have been roaming.
   </p>
   
   <p>This is most beautiful!—</p>
   
   <p>Ashton was running the office when I left. I had a long  and free talk with him about that
      Pleasants and [
      <span class="unclear">Boards?</span>]
      ,
      in 
      connexion
      
       with you, which I must tell you about when we meet. It made me feel quite
      anxious, but I guess all's right, while Ashton is there. Pleasants is a miserable
      devil. I wish I had power in that office for a little while. I'd put a spoke in the
      wheel of his vendetta, which would carry it and him to a
      safe distance.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letters were sent by young Rowland. I attempted to attend to it, but found that
      you had left him full directions, (so he said) which I guess you forgot.
      Nevertheless, I supervised him  as long as I was there.
   </p>
   
   <p>Charley thought his letter to you must have miscarried. He waited for you an hour
      at
      the Fifth Avenue Hotel.
   </p>
   
   <p>I feel awfully sleepy, and am going to bed, a prospect which renders me disconsolate,
      but nature will have her way.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope to see you in Providence.</p>
   
   <p>I heard that Higginson did not like my "Good Gray Poet." This is
      sad. He also had over the story about his reading Leaves of Grass when he was sea
      sick, &amp;c. a good thing, which he evidently thinks bears repeating. O ass of
      hell! I thank thee, [
      <span class="unclear">Gurowski?</span>]
      , for teaching me that word!
