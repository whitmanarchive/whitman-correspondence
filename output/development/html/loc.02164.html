   </p>
   
   
   <p>Though I am pretty well physically it is very lonesome &amp; dreary to me here, &amp; I have
      been thinking all day how much I would like to come over &amp; see you all &amp; stay awhile
      with you. Herbert see about the store &amp; have put up soon as convenient,—&amp; have some
      <u>dry oak wood</u> saved the right length, split &amp; carried up there, &amp; piled in the room. Send me word
      before the end of the week. I wish much to come—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02164_n1">1. The text does not aid
      dating. However, the letter was written during the winter months, and it seems
      reasonable to assume that it was sent shortly after the arrival of the
      Gilchrists in Philadelphia. Note also the similarities to the letter from
      Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of  and
      the letter from Whitman to John Burroughs of . According to his Commonplace Book, Whitman stayed with the
      Gilchrists from January 10 to 16 and from January 25 to February 2 (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.02164_n2">2. Probably a fragment of
      this letter is in the Feinberg Collection (December 15?, 1876).<a href="#r2">[back]
