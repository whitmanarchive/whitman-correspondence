   </p>
   
   <p>I returned to the Regt last night (I have been away on Court Martial you know) and
      found your letter of July 5th and Mothers, and Hannahs, that you sent me at the same
      time. Poor Hann I feel quite worried about her and have just written to her saying
      that Mother and I will come on to see her in the cours of three of four weeks.<sup><a href="#duk.00367_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Walt I suppose you know that we are going to be Mustered out of service, &nbsp;we are
      making out the Muster Rolls now, and we expect to be in New York in about 10 days.<sup><a href="#duk.00367_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I have been over to Washington two or three times since I saw you, but it was always
      in the afternoon (after C.M. hours) so that I could not get up to your place in time
      to see you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt come over and see us, &nbsp;the stage leaves Willards twice every day, and brings
      you right to Camp, so jump in and come over.<sup><a href="#duk.00367_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I have written to Mother to day to let her know that I am coming home, and telling
      her to get ready for a trip to Vermont. I am sleepy so good night Walt.

   <p>The trouble about the informality of Muster is all right</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Washington Whitman (1829â€“1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00367_n100">1. George Whitman was
      promoted to the rank of major on May 18, 1865. During his final months in the
      army, he requested to remain in military service as a career officer but was
      unsuccessful in his petition. See Loving's  to <em>The Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina; Duke University Press,
      1975), 26.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00367_n2">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      planned to visit Hannah Whitman Heyde in Burlington, Vermont. In a letter to
      Walt from September 5, 1865, she wrote: "i have arrived at last to Burlington
      and found hanna quite as well and better than i expected. george came with me to
      troy and went back by the boat from albany" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana,
      Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). Mrs.
      Whitman returned to Brooklyn on October 17, 1865.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00367_n3">3. The Fifty-first Regiment
      of New York Volunteers was discharged from military duty at Alexandria,
      Virginia, on July 25, 1865. Two days later the regiment departed by train from
      Baltimore for Brooklyn.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00367_n4">4. In his diary notes, dated
      simply July 1865, Walt Whitman recorded that he had been over to Alexandria
      twice to have dinner with George (Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library,
