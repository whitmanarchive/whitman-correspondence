      <br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Trusting that the intelligence conveyed will plead for my presumption, I venture
      to enclose you a few lines. At a sale of Autographs &amp; Books a few days ago
      the following prices were obtained. 
      <br><br>
      <span>"Autograph letter, Whitman, Walt, Poet," $80.00</span><br>
      <span>Leaves of Grass 1st Edition 10.00</span><br>
      <br> 
      Which prices were the highest paid for any similar lots. Thinking you might not
      get the above information, I venture to enclose it. 
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      with best wishes
      <br></br>Yours Truly
      <br></br>W. I. Whiting

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The editor of the <em>Critic</em> in 1886 was Jeannette Gilder (1849–1916),
      who wrote that "one of the things of which I am most proud is that the <em>Critic</em> was the first publication of its class to invite
      Walt Whitman to contribute to its pages" (see Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet, and Friend</em> [1915], 97); she
      was assisted in her editorial tasks by her brother Joseph. For more about
      Gilder, see Susan L. Roberson, "Gilder, Jeannette L. (1849–1916)," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
