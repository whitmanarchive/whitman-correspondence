   </p>
   
   
   <p>as I have thought of you almost constantly since I came home I thought I would write
      a few lines to you to let you know that I am feeling pretty well, and sinceerly hope that you are the same.<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Mother<sup><a href="#n1039" id="r2">2</a></sup> [illegible] day, [illegible] been [illegible] she [illegible] City before [illegible] if she should [illegible] no doubt but that she will stop in to see you on her
      
      
      
      her [illegible]. Things are about as they were when you was down here, (any more than we have had
      a fearful storme of wind and sand). The wind blew so hard last Sunday night, that it almost upset
      me when I was comeing home, "for I was <u>out</u> then, as usual." Father and all are well: "John" the 'darkey man' is here yet: [illegible] and George have their fun [illegible] has been [illegible] the [illegible] has been [illegible] about drinking it to [illegible] his skin white; it rather gets to him, but he takes it all in good
      
      
      
      part: he asked Van<sup><a href="#n0883" id="r3">3</a></sup> [illegible] other day, wheather the first man on earth was black or white, and Van told him the first man was white,
      and then John asked him where the black man came from, and Van told hime that a black man was a monkey with his tail cut off, so he gave up talking to him
      and whent on with Georg.
   </p> 
   <p>There is quite [illegible] in the music since [illegible] the wind is [illegible] "Age of [illegible] wish you [illegible], I have been going [illegible] for it for sometime but haven't thought of it before.</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I have been thinking of the suit of cloths which I am to have like yours: I have had myself all pictured out with a suit of
      gray, and a white slouch hat on about fifty times, since you spoke of it; the fellows
      will call me Walt then. I will have to do something great and good in honor of the
      name. What will it be? [illegible] have to close, [illegible] out [illegible] at [illegible] Friday [illegible]

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0590">1. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n1039">2. Susan Stafford, mother of Harry
      Stafford, a young man who Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's parents,
      George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near
      Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. For more
      on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G. Miller, "Stafford, George and Susan
