   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00762_n1">1. Kennedy's biography of
      Longfellow was published in Cambridge, Mass., in 1882. In an undated letter,
      written in late May or early June, Kennedy referred to the Boston censorship: "I
      know you are as serene as a mountain, though you are a grand old god, with all
      your faults. . . . It has taken me three years to get y'r parallax &amp;
      calculate your dimensions" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
