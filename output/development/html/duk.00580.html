   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

<div class="editorial_notes">
   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00580_n11">1. This letter dates to
      between Sunday, April 25, 1869 and Tuesday, April 27, 1869. Richard Maurice
      Bucke dated the letter "about 20," and Edwin Haviland Miller accepted Bucke's
      probable date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). Bucke's and Miller's
      date, however, is too early: the letter refers to a train accident that occurred
      on April 23, 1869, which was reported in the <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Eagle</em> on April 24, 1869. In addition, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman has
      received a letter from Walt Whitman (not extant) in which he expressed concerned
      that his nephew George Van Nostrand was among the accident victims. If Walt
      received news of the accident on the same day that it was reported in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> and the letter to his mother arrived
      the next day, the earliest possible date for Louisa's letter is April 25, 1869.
      The latest possible date is before the return of George Washington Whitman to
      Brooklyn from Camden on Wednesday or Thursday of that week. Louisa also expected
      to move to a new residence on Portland Avenue the following Saturday, May 1, the
      typical moving day in Brooklyn. Because Walt had to write Louisa after he became
      aware of the railroad accident, because Louisa wrote that she "shall have to
      move on saturday," and because one assumes that George Washington Whitman would
      return before the move, the letter must date to between Sunday, April 25, 1869
      and Tuesday, April 27, 1869.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00580_n6">2. Walt Whitman's concern was
      that "George Van Nostrand," one of the dead in a Long Island railroad accident,
      was his nephew. George was the son of Walt Whitman's sister Mary Elizabeth
      (Whitman) Van Nostrand (1821–1899) and Ansel Van Nostrand
      (1821–1899), who lived at Greenport, Long Island. See Clarence Gohdes and
      Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections:
         Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> (Durham, North Carolina:
      Duke University Press, 1949), 206.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00580_n8">3. Walt Whitman's nephew
      George Van Nostrand's exact place of residence is unclear, but Springfield,
      New Jersey, from which Meridan Road is to the north, is approximately 20
      miles east of New York City. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman assumed that Mary Van
      Nostrand's son George was far from the accident at Willow Point Station on
      the Long Island Railroad, some 10 miles east of Brooklyn. But Walt Whitman's
      fears were not baseless. Mary's son George could well have traveled via the
      Long Island Railroad to visit his parents in Greenport, Long Island.<br><br>
      The George Van Nostrand killed in the accident was buried at Jamaica, in
      present-day Queens, and was not Walt's nephew.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00580_n7">4. The unusual word "owawer"
      may be a combination of "owner" to describe Oliver Charlick (see below) and
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's common interjection "o walter." <a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00580_n1">5. The 10:30 Northport train
      from Hunter's Point was five minutes late to the Jamaica station. When
      proceeding to Northport, the final car jumped the track at the Willow Station,
      which resulted in multiple deaths. The Long Island Railroad President and
      Manager was Oliver Charlick. Other deaths listed by Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      are William C. Rushmore, President of the Atlantic National Bank of Brooklyn,
      his nephew Charles M. Pray, a physician, and Matilda Pray (mother of Charles M.
      Pray and daughter of Judge John Dikeman). See "The L. I. Railroad Slaughter.
      Full Particulars of the Calamity," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>,
      April 24, 1869, 2. The man named "old judge dikeman" is John Dikeman
      (1795–1879), County Judge of Kings County from 1864 to 1868 ("Obituary.
      Ex-Judge John Dikeman," <em>New York Times</em>, August 26, 1879,
      5).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00580_n12">6. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided
      in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a
      French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for
      his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah, and Louisa often complained
      about what she here calls "heyds awful letters." Hannah in late 1868 suffered a
      serious thumb infection that led Dr. Samuel Thayer to lance her wrist in
      November. In early December Dr. Thayer amputated Hannah's thumb. For Louisa's
      report to Walt Whitman on the initial surgery, which is based on a letter from
      Charles, see her 
      letter to Walt.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00580_n18">7. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      "aftern" (the "n" is clearly present) indicates that she received her daughter
      Hannah Heyde's letter in the afternoon, in contrast to Charles Heyde's letter
      from the "forenoon." The word is shortened because she reached the edge of the
      page.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">8. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00580_n2">9. The April 1869 letter from
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      is not extant. However, Mattie's husband Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman,
      Louisa's son and Walt's favorite brother, described the family's recent move to
      a boarding house on Pine street in his  letter to Walt. Mattie and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. Mattie's cough, which Louisa mentions in this letter, was
      associated with a throat ailment that led to her death in 1873. See Randall H.
      Waldron, ed., "Introduction," <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha
         Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      1–26.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00580_n14">10. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      may not have known Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's exact salary as chief
      engineer, but she had heard reports that Jeff's earnings far exceeded that of
      his brothers. Louisa wrote the previous year, based on a report by Moses Lane,
      that the St. Louis Water Works had "raised Jeffs salary to 6000," a figure that
      Louisa did not believe (see her  letter
      to Walt). Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price have documented Jeff's initial
      salary at $330 per month, or $3960 per year. (See Jeff's  letter to Walt Whitman, n. 1.)<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00580_n13">11. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and sons Edward Whitman and George Washington Whitman moved from 1149 Atlantic
      Avenue to 71 Portland Avenue on Saturday, May 1, the traditional moving day in
      Brooklyn because annual leases expired on that day.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00515_n4">12. Margret Steers, her husband
      Thomas Steers (1826–1869), and their four children Thomas (b. 1853),
      Caroline (b. 1857), Louisa (b. 1862), and Margret (b. 1865) moved into the
      Atlantic Avenue building in November 1868. Thomas Steers operated a bakery, and
      his wife, who would become a close friend of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,
      continued the business when he died in January 1869. After Thomas Steers' sudden
      death, Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman replied to an early 1869 letter from
      Louisa (not extant) with concern that "Mr. Steers' death had quite an effect on
      you." George Washington Whitman sold a property to Margaret Steers in January
      1871, and the property had title trouble with regard to unpaid assessments (see
      Mattie Whitman's February? 1869 letter to Louisa in Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1977], 67; Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman; "Died,"
      <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, January 22, 1869, 3; <em>United States Census, 1870</em>. New York, Brooklyn Ward 7,
      Kings, District 1; and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00580_n16">13. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      may refer to her hope that she will not have to move soon, or she may refer
      indirectly to the unexpected death of Margret Steers' husband (her neighbor; see
      previous note) in early 1869.<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n5">14. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
      later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
      Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
      pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
      correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
      poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00580_n17">15. "Walt Whitman, says the
      Springfield <em>Republican</em>, never carried his eccentricities
      of appearance to greater length than at present. He wanders up and down the
      avenue in Washington every day. His hair, to which the old poet gives free
      scope, falls below his shoulders, and his head is crowned by an immense,
      weather-stained hat, broad-brimmed as a Quaker's, and 'skewed' all out of shape"
      ("Facts and Fancies," <em>Daily Evening Bulletin</em>, February
      22, 1869, 1). The note in the Philadelphia paper is a condensed excerpt from
      "Surface Life at Washington," <em>Springfield Republican</em>,
      February 16, 1869, 2,5. Also see Gary Scharnhorst, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00875.pdf">Rediscovered Nineteenth-Century Whitman Articles</a>," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 19:3 (2002), 183–186.<a href="#r15">[back]
