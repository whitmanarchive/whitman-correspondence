   <p>W.H. Piper Co. of Boston say they would like to place your new
      Edition of the "Leaves" on their counter, &amp; sell it as they
      sell other books. They would take, say, 50 copies to begin with. There is a small
      continuous dropping-in demand for the "Leaves,"  &amp; copies of the Thayer &amp;
      Eldridge edition sell for $5. You might write directly to
      <u>W.H. Piper</u>, using my name. He will be a good man to
      retail the book: he would also have undertaken to publish &amp; push it but for the
      opposition of others.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr. Newton was not able to call on you for the little volume you
      wished to send me by him. It came by  mail,—through W.D. O'C's agency, I perceive, with a N.Y. Times enclosed. I thank you
      both. I had already bought a copy of the critique, but as a friend had carried it
      off, I was very glad to get another. It is a unique &amp; delightful little
      treatise: how bold &amp; fresh &amp; native! I hope some day to see the author.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My love to the O'Connors. I owe W<u>m</u> for a  long &amp;
      eloquent letter, received I don't dare to say how long ago. I am hungry to see you
      &amp; him and Mrs. O'C. again: if you or they ever come near
      me, you must surely visit me.
   </p>

      Sincerely your friend

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Townsend Trowbridge
      was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
      Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
      Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
      Eldridge edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He again met Whitman
      in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Treasury Secretary Salmon P.
      Chase in order to gather material for his biography, <em>The Ferry
         Boy and the Financier</em> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described
      their meetings in <em>My Own Story</em>, (Boston: Houghton and
      Mifflin, 1903), 360–401, with recollections of noted persons. On December
      11, 1862, Trowbridge had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending
      Whitman; see Emerson's letter from . Though Trowbridge was not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to
      William D. O'Connor in 1867: "Every year confirms my earliest impression, that
      no book has approached the power and greatness of this book, since the Lear and
      Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A. Coleman, "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 [1951–52], 327). For
      Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.71.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> (1906–1996), 3:506. See
      also Coleman, "Trowbridge and Whitman," <em>PMLA</em>, 63 (1948),
      262–273. For several weeks in 1863, Trowbridge stayed with Whitman in
      Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William D. O'Connor.
