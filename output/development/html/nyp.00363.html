   <h4>Notes:</h4>

      This piece of correspondence is addressed, "Pete Doyle, | M st. South, bet 4½
      &amp; 6th | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Mar | 26 | (?) ;
      Carrier | 27 | Mar | 8 AM."<br><br>
      This and Whitman's  letter to
      Doyle were written on Fridays, if the year is correct. In both notes Whitman
      seems to refer to the serious relapse in February 1875. This card alludes to
      Doyle's new, but temporary, position in Baltimore; see also Whitman's  letter to Doyle.<a href="#r1">[back]
