   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00633_n2">1. This letter dates to
      February 14 or February 15, 1870. The day Tuesday and "14" are in Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter February 1871.
      February 14 fell on Tuesday in 1871, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with
      Bucke's date (see Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:368). The evidence for the
      month of February is Louisa's query about Walt Whitman's Valentines at the
      letter's close. However, Bucke's and Miller's assigned year is incorrect, and
      because the year is incorrect, the day of week and calendar date are off also.
      Louisa noted the death of "vanvories the ex supervisor," and Dominicus S.
      Vorhees, a builder, was shot not in 1871 but on February 13, 1870, a Sunday.
      Valentine's Day, February 14, fell on Monday in 1870. Therefore, the letter
      dates not to February 14, 1871 but to February 14 or 15, 1870.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00633_n9">2. Walt Whitman's February 12
      or 13?, 1870 letter is not extant, and the book that he sent is not known. The
      date that Edwin Haviland Miller assigned for Walt's lost February 13(?), 1871
      letter, which is attested by this letter from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, must
      also date the previous year (see Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:362).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00633_n11">4. Dominicus S. Vorhees, a
      builder and former Supervisor for the Tenth Ward in Brooklyn, was shot on
      Sunday, February 13, 1870 ("Startling Assassination," <em>Brooklyn
         Daily Eagle</em>, February 14, 1870, 3). According to witnesses, the alleged
      shooter, William Chambers, was intoxicated and declared himself a member of the
      Fenian Brotherhood, which advocated Irish independence. According to the
      article, Vorhees and his companions invited Chambers to share a glass, and
      Chambers allegedly shot Vorhees without provocation.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00438_n4">5. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00633_n13">6. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      son Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman,
      and their two daughters lived in St. Louis, where Jeff had relocated in 1867 to
      assume the position of Superintendent of Water Works. For more on Jeff, see
