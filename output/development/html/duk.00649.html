      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I write to ask your kind offices in the following described matter:</p>
   
   
   <p>I sent to Doolady<sup><a href="#duk.00649_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> six weeks ago an order
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr. James Gray, Bookbinder 16 Spruce st. 4th floor, is the custodian of the sheets
      of my Leaves of Grass, &amp; has been the binder for me. The sheets are now at his
      place.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hear that he has become involved—in fact has failed. If so, I regret it
      much.<sup><a href="#duk.00649_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been waiting now over six weeks for the fulfilment of orders I have sent him
      for bound books—&amp; now, under that state of things, I suppose it will not
      be possible for him to do the work.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Dionysius Thomas was a New York City bookseller who
      apparently had copies of the first edition of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> (as Whitman told Gordon Lester Ford on ). However, by , Whitman told an unidentified correspondent, "some time ago Dion
      Thomas, bookseller, 2d story, Fulton st. north side, about midway bet. Nassau
      and Broadway, had some copies of 1st edition Leaves of Grass—but whether he
      still has them to sell I cannot say[.]"

      This draft letter is endorsed (by Whitman), "Dion Thomas | Nassau st. bet
      Beekman &amp; Spru[ce]." Whitman crossed out the draft, and on the back
      wrote a series of notes labeled "Specimen Days."<br><br>
      In the Clifton Waller Barrett Collection at the University of Virginia, there
      is an envelope, postmarked October 16, addressed to: "Dion Thomas, |

   <p id="duk.00649_n4">3. In 1888 Whitman spoke of
      "a history and a grief" in connection with the 1867 edition: "It was got up by a
      friend of mine, a young fellow, printed from type, in New York. One day I
      received the intelligence . . . that the place had been seized for debt. I
      received a portion of the books remaining—the most of them were lost"
