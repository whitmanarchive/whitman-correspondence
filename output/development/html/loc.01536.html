      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will write you a few lines as I sit here, on a clump of sand by the sea shore—having
      some paper in my haversack, 
      &amp; an hour or two yet, before I start back. Pete, I wish you were with me the few hours
      past—I have just had a splendid swim &amp; souse in the surf—the waves are slowly rolling
      in, with a hoarse roar 
      that is music to my ears—the breeze blows pretty brisk from south-west, &amp; the sun
      is partially clouded—from where I sit I look out on the bay &amp; down the Narrows—vessels
      sailing in every direction in the distance—a great big black long ocean steamship
      streaking it up toward New York—&amp; the lines of hills &amp; mountains, far, 
      far away, on the Jersey Coast, a little veiled with blue vapor—here around me, as
      I sit, it is nothing but barren sand—but I don't know how long I could sit here, to
      that soothing, rumbling murmuring of the waves—&amp; then the salt breeze—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, if you are still working, and all is going on smooth, you can send me that $50—you
      might get Mr. Milburn to send it to me by post-office order—give it to him, with this
      envelope, 
      &amp; ask him to go to p. o. &amp; send a p. o. order to me—it will save you the trouble—But
      Pete, dear boy, 
      if any thing has turned up in mean time, you needn't send it, as I can get along otherwise<sup><a href="#loc.01536_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am doing very well, both in health &amp; <em>business prospects</em> here—my book is doing first rate—so every thing is lovely &amp; the goose hangs high—Your
      loving comrade &amp; father
      
   </p>

      <br></br>Walt.

   <p>Friday July 20.<sup><a href="#loc.01536_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear son, I wrote the preceding nearly a week ago, intending to finish &amp; send it then—Nothing
      very new or special with me—Mother has been quite unwell, gets better, &amp; then worse
      again—I have applied for a few days further leave—The weather here remains nearly
      perfect—we have had but three or four uncomfortably hot days the past five weeks—every
      day a fine breeze smelling of the sea—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
