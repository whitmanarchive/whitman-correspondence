   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Katherine (sometimes spelled
      "Catherine") B. Johnston (b. 1874) was a daughter of John H. Johnston, a jeweler
      and close friend of Whitman's. Katherine had at least six siblings, four of whom
      were older and two that were younger. When Whitman visited the Johnston family
      for the first time early in 1877, Katherine ("Kittie," "Kitty") would have been
      three years old.

   <p id="loc.02586_n4">4. On  Katherine (Kitty) wrote to "My dear Uncle Walt":
      "We have once more made a nest but need one dear person to make the family
      complete; this person is a Grandpa; won't you come and be one to us? we would
      all be so happy if you came. There is a pretty park in front which is nice even
      in Winter; at night the electric lights are very pretty. Then in Summer you
      could walk in the park with us children as you used to do on 5th Ave. Do come,
      when ever it pleases <em>you</em> (but I want you <em>very, very</em> soon!)." "Kitty" and her brother Harold were
      photographed with the poet in 1879 (See Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>Walt Whitman: The Correspondence</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77), vol. 3, following page 202).<a href="#r4">[back]
