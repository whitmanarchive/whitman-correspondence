   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00616_n1">1. This letter dates to
      February 27, 1873. The date February 27 is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand.
      Edwin Haviland Miller accepted Louisa's date and assigned the year 1873 (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:370). Miller's date is correct. The letter
      refers to the recent death of Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, and Mattie died
      on February 19, 1873 (see Thomas Jefferson Whitman's February 24, 1873 letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson
         Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984], 158).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00616_n3">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As
      a civil engineer, Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in
      1867 and a nationally recognized name. He married Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman (1836–1873) in 1859, and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman shared
      their Brooklyn residence until Jeff departed for St. Louis in 1867. For more
      on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      Jeff had sent word by telegraph of Mattie's death on February 19, and he
      apologized in his February 24, 1873 letter to his mother—which she had
      yet to receive—for not writing. Jeff explained that "there were many
      things I had to do" (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson
         Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984],
      158).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00616_n4">3. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman (1836–1873) died on February 19, 1873 from complications
      associated with a throat ailment that had first been noted by her husband Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in February 1863. Mattie and Jeff had two daughters,
      Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St.
      Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
      emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26. Waldron reports that a physician identified the cause
      of death as cancer (3). Robert Roper has speculated that Mattie's accompanying
      bronchial symptoms may have been associated with tuberculosis (<em>Now the Drum of War</em> [New York: Walker, 2008], 78–79).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n6">4. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00616_n6">5. The "little girls" are
      Manahatta "Hattie" (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" Whitman
      (1863–1957), the daughters of Jeff and Mattie Whitman. Hattie, who lived
      most of the first seven years of her life in the same home with Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman, was especially close to her grandmother. Hattie and Jessie
      Louisa were both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n4">6. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00616_n8">7. Walt Whitman wrote that
      Ursula North Burroughs would be "here probably to-day with a carriage to take me
      out riding" (see his  letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman). In January 1873, he had suffered a paralytic stroke
      that initially confined him to bed: it took weeks before he could resume
      walking. He first reported the stroke to his mother in his  letter. For more on Walt Whitman's
      relationship with the Burroughs family, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John (1837–1921) and Ursula
         (1836–1917)</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00616_n9">8. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      had yet to receive Jeff Whitman's February 24, 1873 letter and Manahatta
      "Hattie" Whitman's February 23, 1873 letter. See Jeff Whitman's February 24,
      1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price,
      ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson
         Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984], 158). Jeff's
      daughter Hattie wrote, "Oh if you could only be here I would be so glad I shall
      never see Dear Mama again" (see Manahatta Whitman's  letter to Louisa, Library of Congress, Feinberg
      Collection).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">9. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00616_n11">10. George Washington Whitman
      would build a larger house on the corner lot at 431 Stevens Street in Camden,
      New Jersey (see Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975], 31).<a href="#r10">[back]
