      <br></br><br></br> Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I don't suppose the enclosed will give you nearly so much pleasure as it gives
      me. But Villiers Stanford<sup><a href="#loc.05769_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> is, I
      think, the best composer England has produced since the days of Purcell &amp; Blow,
      and your words will be sent home to hundreds &amp; thousands who had not before seen
      them. How lovely the words read as themes for great music! 
   </p>
   
   <p> I have been staying with old friends who have a house you would enjoy—it
      stands all alone on the top of a heath-clad hill, with miles of coppice (young
      woods) below it, and spread out beyond is a rich valley with more wooded hills
      jutting out into it—and you see the storms a long way off travelling up from
      the sea, and you can wander for miles &amp; miles through the woods or over the
      breezy hill—or, as you sit at your window, feel yourself in the very heart of
      a great, beautiful solitude. Very kind, warm friends, too, they are, who leave you
      as free as a bird to do what you like. I have had all the papers, dear friend, &amp;
      have enjoyed them. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Now I am in the heart of the "Black Country," as we call it—black with the
      smoke of thousands of foundries &amp; works of all kinds—staying with Percy
      &amp; his wife. Percy<sup><a href="#n2000" id="r2">2</a></sup> is having a very arduous time here
      starting some Steel Works—&amp; what with his men being inexperienced &amp;
      times bad &amp; the machinery not yet perfectly adjusted, he seems harassed night
      &amp; day—for these things have to be kept going all night too—but I
      hope he will get into smoother waters soon. The little son is rosy &amp; bright
      &amp; healthy—goes to school now, which, being an only child, he enjoys
      mightily for the sake of the companionship of other boys. 
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Love from us all, dear friend.
      <br></br>A. Gilchrist.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> Grace<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r4">4</a></sup> well &amp; busy when
      I left.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
