       I do believe—260 pp—Have done for you what Ruskin did for Turner. It is the most
      scholarly, fiery, and heavy-artillery piece of work I have yet done; took all my strength,
      I can tell you. It
      about exhausts the subject &amp; me too, I have a bibliography also

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02895_n2">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | Camden | N. Jersey | 328 Mickle St. It is postmarked: BOSTON,
      MASS | APR 20 | 9-AM | 1886; [illegible]MDE[illegible] | AP[illegible] | [illegible] | 7 [illegible] | 18 [illegible].<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02893_n1">2. As euphoric as Kennedy
      sounds in this letter, his book-length study of Whitman would not see the light
      of day until 1896, when it was published as <em>Reminiscences of
         Walt Whitman</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">3. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

         </a></p>
   <p id="n1043">4. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="uva.00476_n1">5. Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0199">7. Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>).
