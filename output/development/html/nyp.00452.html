   <p>Your valued letter 
      rec'd, it <em>is</em> like a kindly living talk and hand
      clasp<sup><a href="#nyp.00452_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I shall forward it to Burroughs—So
      good to hear you &amp; yours active, full of receptivity and well—I have
      lately had a bad spell, prostration &amp;c again, but am now well as usual. Dont
      forget the <em>Academy</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00452_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> if it
      appears—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00452_n1">1. Dowden's letter was sent
      to O'Connor and others and is apparently lost. On  Dowden acknowledged Whitman's card and urged the poet to
      "try a voyage across the Atlantic" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:363).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00452_n2">2. Dowden's review of <em>Specimen Days</em> appeared in <em>The
         Academy</em> on November 18. See also Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co.,
      1931), 233.<a href="#r2">[back]
