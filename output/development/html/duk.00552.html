   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00552_n14">1. This letter dates to
      November 10, 1868. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to 1868. Edwin
      Haviland Miller also dated the letter November 10, 1868 (see Walt Whitman,
      <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77], 2:366). Bucke's and Miller's date is correct. The
      year is consistent both with the death of Charley Mann, whose illness is
      mentioned in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt, and with the year (but not the month)
      in which Louisa's daughter Hannah Heyde's thumb was amputated.<br><br>
      The letter is difficult to reconcile with Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's
      late-1868 visit to Brooklyn and with Hannah's surgery. Louisa acknowledged
      two recent letters from Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Mattie, letters
      that were prompted, Louisa said, by a letter from Walt that "stirred them
      up." That both Mattie and Jeff would write to Louisa in early November 1868
      is quizzical because Mattie began an extended visit to Brooklyn for medical
      treatment in mid-October 1868 (see Walt's  letter to Jeff). Furthermore, it has been assumed that
      Mattie, who came to Brooklyn in part for medical treatment, remained in
      Brooklyn from her mid-October arrival until her return to St. Louis with
      Jeff in mid-December. Walt's letter implies the same when he described
      Mattie as "comfortably situated" (Miller <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, 2:68, n. 21; Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1977], 60). But Mattie was unlikely to have
      remained with Louisa from mid-October to mid-December. Mattie in early
      November 1868 presumably returned to St. Louis (or visited elsewhere), which
      would explain why Walt's forwarded letter from Louisa could prompt a "letter
      from jeff and one from matty." Louisa's reference to Hannah's "losing her
      thumb" presents another complication for dating the letter. If the month and
      year, November 1868, are correct, Louisa cannot refer to the surgical
      amputation of Hannah's thumb (in December 1868) but rather to its loss of
      use.<br><br>
      The letter cannot date earlier than the election of 1868, when Charley Mann
      was noted ill but alive, nor can it date to the following year, by which
      time Louisa had moved to Portland Avenue.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00552_n1">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      had written the previous week, "little charley down stairs is very sick"
      (see her  letter to Walt
      Whitman).<br><br>
      In an annotation to the letter in Richard Maurice Bucke's hand, the surname
      of "little charley" is given as Mann. A  letter from Mary E. Mann, presumably Charley Mann's mother,
      to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman confirms the spelling of the name is
      Mann.<a href="#r3">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00552_n3">5. Charlie Mann is described as
      a "down stairs" neighbor in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter. This "Janey" may have been a relative
      of Charlie Mann or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's upstairs neighbor, Jenne
      Chappell, whom Louisa described in her  letter to Walt Whitman as the wife of "the doctor."<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="duk.00552_n9">6. The letter is not extant.
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite
      brother. In early adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer.
      In the 1850s he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained
      employed through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water
      Works in St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering.
      For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00552_n4">7. This letter is not extant.
      Martha Mitchell Whitman (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of
      Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two
      daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved
      to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed.,
      <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New
      York: New York University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00552_n17">8. Louisa Van Velsor lamented
      missing money in a letter from Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and a lack of
      letters from Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman in her  letter to Walt Whitman: "every time Jeff sends me
      any money its stolen i wrote three letters to maty thinking it so strange i got
      no answer." The statement seems the best candidate to have "stirred them up," if
      Walt forwarded her letter.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n5">9. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided
      in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a
      French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for
      his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00552_n11">10. This letter, if the date is
      correct, preceded the amputation of Hannah Heyde's thumb, though she may already
      have lost the use of the digit. For the initial surgical effort to relieve the
      infection, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman. Charles L. Heyde in his December 1868
      letter to Louisa described the surgical amputation by Samuel W. Thayer: the
      "thumb had been dead, at the extremity for many days[,]" and was "quite
      offensive" (Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint
         Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em>
      [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 225–226).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00470_n8">11. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
      and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">12. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r12">[back]
