      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Both your letters came this week—also one from my friend Eldridge, he too
      speaks of meeting &amp; talking with you.—It is real winter here, the ground all
      covered with snow, as I look out—not the least thaw to-day, as it is
      cloudy—I rise pretty late mornings—had my breakfast a little
      while ago, mutton-chop, coffee, nice brown bread &amp; sweet butter, very
      nice—eat with very fair appetite—I enjoy my breakfast better than any
      other meal—(eat a light dinner pretty late, &amp; no supper)—Feel
      generally about the same as before described—no worse, no better, (nothing to
      brag of anyhow)
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I have mentioned about my crossing the ferry—from our house, the cars run by
      the next corner, (200 feet, or less,) a half mile or so to the ferry—the
      Delaware here is full three quarters of a mile wide—it is a noble river, not
      so wide as the Potomac, nor with the fine banks like Arlington, but grander, &amp;
      with more style, &amp; with powerful, rushing tides, now great processions of broken
      ice, many little &amp; some great big cakes—the boats are very fine &amp;
      strong, go crashing right ahead, with a loud noise, breaking the cakes often a foot
      thick &amp; more—I enjoy crossing these days—it does me good—the
      ferrymen are all very kind &amp; respectful—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I have been reading a book "<u>Merrie England in the Olden
         Time</u>,"<sup><a href="#loc.01639_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> a London book, with pictures, full of fun &amp; humor—I have enjoyed
      it much—There is an awful amount of want &amp; suffering, from no work,
      hereabout—a young man was here yesterday—had seen me in
      Wash—wanted help—I gave him a little—I see the cars &amp;
      locomotive skurrying by as I close. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
