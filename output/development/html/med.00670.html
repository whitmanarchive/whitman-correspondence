   <p>Yours of 7th from N.Y. 
      rec'd
      
       last night. I will scratch off some suggestions:
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In composing the letter, let it be brief, and don't mention the subject—or, if
      you do, <em>just say indefinitely that it is about Abraham
         Lincoln</em> (which you may do, if you think proper)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I would like Gilder's<sup><a href="#sjs.00005_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> name on the letter—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The suggestion (Gilder's) <em>about 8 or 10 names only</em>—<em>good ones only</em>—should be carried out. About the Hall I
      leave to your selection (not the very biggest ones, however, would seem to me
      best)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I would like Whitelaw Reid's<sup><a href="#sjs.00005_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> name to cap the
      list—Couldn't the <em>World</em> man, Schuyler<sup><a href="#sjs.00005_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> (if he is there yet?) come next?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Elliott F. Shepard the lawyer,<sup><a href="#sjs.00005_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> might be a good name.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Take [J. H.] Johnston into your councils, in any business and pecuniary
      arrangements—he is very 'cute and I consider him a true friend of mine.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am particular about the names. Let [Joel] Benton<sup><a href="#sjs.00005_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> have
      my letters, take as much as possible my point of view, and he might write to me
      here.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Private</p>
   
   <p>I care little—or rather nothing at all—about Bayard Taylor's<sup><a href="#sjs.00005_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> or G. W. Curtis's<sup><a href="#sjs.00005_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> names
      on the letter. Don't want them. If they get on, let them be, of course—but
      don't you make any point about getting them. I suppose you understand me.
   </p>
   
   <p>Of course the letters I write you are for perusal by all my friends—Gilder,
      Swinton, Benton, &amp;c.—but if I write <em>private</em>, it
      is for you alone.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="sjs.00005_n1">1. Richard Watson Gilder
      (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <em>The Century</em>, from 1881 until his death. During his
      lifetime, Gilder also published several collections of poetry. Whitman had met
      Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1955], 482). He attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
      Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the New York
      <em>Tribune</em>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder one
      of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art delirium"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      [1906–1996], 9 vols., 2:93).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="sjs.00005_n2">2. The editor of the New
      York <em>Tribune</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00005_n3">3. Montgomery Schuyler
      (1843–1914) was associated with the New York <em>World</em>
      from 1865 to 1883 and with the New York <em>Times</em> from 1883
      until his retirement in 1907. He was also managing editor of <em>Harper's Weekly</em> from 1885 to 1887.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00005_n4">4. Shepard, a colonel in
      George Washington Whitman's regiment during the Civil War, was now a New York
      attorney (see the letter from Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman of , and <em>Wilson's
         Business Directory of New York City</em> for 1878–1879).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00005_n5">5. Joel Benton
      (1832–1911) was a poet and a friend of Burroughs (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York:
      Houghton Mifflin, 1931], 18,174).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>

      Whitman to John Burroughs of , and
      the letter from Whitman to Bayard Taylor of .<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="sjs.00005_n7">7. George William Curtis
      (1824–1892), the editor of <em>Harper's Monthly</em>, was
      disliked by Whitman's friends. Burroughs termed Curtis "an orator that fairly
      leaned and languished on the bosom of the graces" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York:
      Houghton Mifflin, 1931], 173). Speaking of Curtis's criticisms of Whitman in <em>Harper's</em> "Easy Chair" in June 1876, William Douglas
      O'Connor observed in a letter to Burroughs, "The artificial mountain in Brooklyn
      park has labored and produced a toy mouse!" (Barrus, 131, 141–142).<a href="#r7">[back]
