      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter of Tuesday last, &amp; was glad to hear every thing was going on all
      right. I am well, 
      &amp; still enjoying myself in a quiet way—I have been home every evening since I come—but
      out quite a good 
      deal in the day—the weather is splendid here—plenty cool enough. This has got to be
      a great place for boating—All the rich men have their yachts, and most every young
      man belongs to a boat or yacht club—sometimes of a pleasant day, especially Sunday,
      you will see them out all over up &amp; down the bay in swarms—the yachts look beautiful
      enough, with white sails &amp; many with white hulls &amp; their long pennants flying—it is
      a new thing to see them so plenty.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>11 o'clock Friday forenoon.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, I am sitting in my room home, finishing this—have just had a bath, &amp; dressed
      myself to go over to New York, 
      partly on business—shall go down &amp; put this in the P. O. here—shall walk down as it
      is a very pleasant forenoon—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When you write tell me if you have read Charles Reade's novel of "Foul Play"<sup><a href="#loc.01599_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—if not, I have one here I will send you—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear son, I believe that is all this time—I send my love, dear son, &amp; a good loving
      kiss—I think of you every day—Give my best regards to all enquiring friends, &amp; inform
      them I expect to be back in about three weeks—
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Good bye, my darling boy—from your comrade &amp; father,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Flood was a streetcar conductor in New York,
      known, according to an unidentified notation on his letter to Walt Whitman, as
      "Broadway Jack." According to date entries in an address book (the Library of
      Congress # 109), Whitman saw Flood on September 30, 1868, and October 5, 1868,
      and rode with him on his Second Avenue car. Flood had been a conductor for ten
      years. After Whitman's return to Washington, there was a brief correspondence,
      consisting of four extant letters from Whitman (dated , ,
      , and ) and one from the young man. Flood wrote on : "Sir, It is with great pleasure
      that I sit down with pen in hand to address a few lines to you." He informed
      Walt Whitman that he had lost his position on New Year's Eve and that he was now
      seeking another job: "I shall still continue to correspond and can never forget
      your kind friendship towards me. ... Your True and Ever intimate friend."
      According to the first listing of his name in the New York Directory, in
      1872–1873, he was at that time either in the milk business or a
      milkman.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01599_n1">1. This letter cannot have been written in
      1872 (the year assigned by the executors), for then Walt Whitman read a poem at
      Dartmouth College on June 26, 1872, and visited Hannah at Burlington, Vermont,
      on June 30, 1872; Whitman described the 1872 trip in his  letter to Charles Eldridge. Note also the similar
      material in this and Whitman's 
      letter to Ellen M. O'Connor.<a href="#r1">[back]
