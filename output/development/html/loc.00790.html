   </p>
   
   <p>I thought I would write you a few lines &amp; see if they would reach you—I was very much
      disappointed when I went to Armory that evening to find my dear comrade was gone so
      sudden &amp; unexpected.<sup><a href="#loc.00790_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Thuey, did you take the envelope you had with my address?—if you did why have you
      not written to me, comrade?
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>What kind of accommodations have you at Carlisle, Thu, &amp; how is the foot? I want to
      hear all about it—If you get this you must write to me, Thu, you need not mind ceremony—there
      is no need of ceremony between dear friends for that I hope we are, my loving boy,
      for all the difference in our ages.
   </p>
   
   <p>There is nothing new with me here—I am very well in health &amp; spirits, &amp; only need
      some employment, clerkship or something, at fair wages to make things go agreeable
      with me—no, there is one thing more I need &amp; that is Thuey, for I believe I am quite
      a fool, I miss you so.<sup><a href="#loc.00790_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Well, Thu, it seems as though they were moving again in front—Pleasonton<sup><a href="#loc.00790_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> has been advancing &amp; fighting—he had all the cavalry moving, had quite a fight last
      Sunday, driving Stuart<sup><a href="#loc.00790_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup>—a good many wounded were brought here very late Monday night 12 o'clock—some 70 to
      Armory Hospital—all cavalry. In Ward A things go on the same—I dont go as often there as I did—Pyne &amp; I went on quite a spree Monday, went to the mystic
      Varieties &amp; elsewhere, (saw the ghost as they call it)<sup><a href="#loc.00790_n7" id="r6">6</a></sup>—had an oyster supper, ale, &amp;c. quite a time—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well I will not write any more this time—so good bye for present, Thuey, &amp; I pray
      God bless you, my dear loving comrade, &amp; I hope he will bring us together again—good
      by, dear boy, from your true friend—
   </p>
   
   <p>Thuey, I enclose an envelope but will write my address here too for future—</p>
   
   <p>Thuey, you went away without getting paid, aint you broke? I can send you a little, a few 10ct bills, my darling—You write to me,
      Thu, just how it is—you need not be afraid, my darling comrade—it is little, but it
      may be some use—Thuey, you write to me just as you would to your own older brother—<sup><a href="#loc.00790_n100" id="r7">7</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00790_n2">1. According to his diary
      (Charles I. Glicksberg, <em>Walt Whitman and the Civil War</em>
      [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1933], 136), Whitman sent a
      letter to Bethuel Smith on September 16, 1863. Bethuel Smith, Company F, Second
      U.S. Cavalry, was wounded in 1863. He wrote to Whitman on , from the U.S. General Hospital
      at Carlisle, Pennsylanvia, "I left the armory hospital in somewhat of A hurry."
      He expected, he explained on ,
      to rejoin his regiment shortly, and was stationed near Washington when he wrote
      on . He wrote on , from Culpeper, Virginia, that he
      was doing provost duty, and on ,
      he was in a camp near Mitchell Station, Virginia, where "the duty is verry
      hard." He was wounded again on June 11 (so his parents reported to Whitman on
      ), was transported to
      Washington, and went home on furlough on July 1. He returned on August 14 to
      Finley Hospital, where, on , he
      wrote to Whitman: "I would like to see you verry much, I have drempt of you
      often &amp; thought of you oftener still." He expected to leave the next day for
      Carlisle Barracks to be mustered out, and on , he wrote to Whitman from Queensbury, New York. When his parents
      communicated with Walt Whitman on , Bethuel was well enough to perform tasks on the farm. Smith was one
      of the soldiers to whom Whitman wrote ten years later; see Whitman's letter to
      Bethuel Smith, December 1874 (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, 6 vols. [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:318–319).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00790_n3">2. At this point Whitman
      deleted: "Thuey, I think about you often &amp; miss you more than you have any
      idea of—I hope you will . . ."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>

      phrasing in Whitman's letter from

   <p id="loc.00790_n5">4. Alfred Pleasonton

      participated in battles at Culpepper Courthouse and Brandy Station.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.00790_n7">6. Washington theaters were
      featuring "ghosts" in September 1863. The "Original Ghost" appeared at the
      Varieties on September 7. The Washington Theatre and Canterbury Hall also
      advertised ghosts on the same date, and Ford's New Theatre announced the
      imminent appearance of a specter.<a href="#r6">[back]
