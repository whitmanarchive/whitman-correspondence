   <p>Thanks for the paper "A Ship over Niagara" &amp; "Parodies."<sup><a href="#syr.00037_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I recollect the story of the ship very well, it was
      often told and referred to when I was a little boy.  Your letter of 23<u>d</u> and 24<u>th</u> also came this
      morning. I am glad the binding is settled and I think from your description it will
      do very well tho' nothing to become especially enthusiastic about.<sup><a href="#syr.00037_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I shall be glad to see it. Will not the price of binding
      cut into the price of the book a good deal? [—] $1.24 is a big slice off $6.
      [—] The price of the book should have been more than $6. I would not have put
      it a cent below $10. if I had had my way.<sup><a href="#syr.00037_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I predict that
      a copy of that book will be worth $50 in ten years and $100. in 25 years. But I
      suppose you will say "we are living in '89 not '99 or '14." [—] So Rice <sup><a href="#n6004" id="r5">5</a></sup> wants you to write for his review?<sup><a href="#syr.00037_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      I wouldn't mind if he would print some pieces written by your friends and leave out
      such miserable trash as that written by Kennedy<sup><a href="#syr.00037_n6" id="r7">7</a></sup> a few
      years ago—Do you recollect when Pearsall Smith<sup><a href="#n6122" id="r8">8</a></sup> brought it
      home and reads extracts from it at the teatable? The Inspector came while I was
      writing the above and I had to break off [.] (It is now <u>noon,
         Sunday)</u> [.] at 11.30 last night a fire broke out in the north cottage I was
      at work there untill 5o'c. this morning. The centre building was gutted but no life
      lost. The damage [mutilation] will be $4000 or $5000. [—] A lively snow storm
      has set in, we may have sleighing at last (the last snow storm /I/ told you about
      was a failure, did not amount to any thing after all /no sleighing at all this
      winter yet./). Every body at the asylum is hard at work making provision for
      accommodation of the sixty patients who occupied the north cottage. Goodly, dear
      Walt

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
