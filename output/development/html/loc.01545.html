      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter yesterday. Pete you must be quite steady at work, &amp; no time to
      spare. 
      Well, perhaps it is just as satisfactory, considering all things. The cold weather
      has just 
      kept on here, as before—cold enough all the time—and then a spell of <u>damned bitter, 
         stinging cold</u>, every now and then extra—not one single mild, warm day since I have 
      been home—six weeks—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I am middling well, go out some every day, but not much—Best thing is my <u>eating</u> &amp; <u>sleeping</u>—I fall back on them altogether—I sleep splendid, have a good bed, plenty of cover—get
      up 
      pretty early though &amp; make the fire, &amp; set things a going, before mother comes out—she 
      has had some bad times with rheumatism, &amp;c—one hand &amp; arm quite disabled—still she
      
      is very cheerful, looks well in the face, &amp; does more work cooking &amp;c. than most young
      
      women—We have grand breakfasts, buckwheat cakes, coffee, &amp;c. eggs, &amp;c—just wish you
      could 
      come in mornings &amp; partake—We two always breakfast together, &amp; it is first rate—So
      you 
      see I fall back on sleeping &amp; eating, (as I said)—Should be glad to see Parker Milburn—hope
      he will call to-day—I send you a paper by mail
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Well Pete I believe that is all, this time. Good bye, my darling son—So the <u>new shirts</u> turn out 
      a success do they? I have a great mind to be jealous—Give my love to 
      Wash Milburn, Adrian Jones, &amp; all the RR boys.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
