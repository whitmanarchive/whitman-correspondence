      <br></br>Camden, N.J.
      <br></br>Dear Walt Whitman:
      
   </p> 
   
   
   <p> I got your letter when I was in Washington and fully expected to stay over and see
      you on my return,<sup><a href="#loc.03286_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> but I was kept so much longer than I
      thought I would be kept and so much more work was thrown on me that I was compelled
      to hurry back to New York by night. It is possible that I may be in Philadelphia
      this week—indeed it is probable—and in that case I shall certainly cross
      the ferry; but in the meantime why should you be idle? I shall not presume to give
      you any hints as to how to write; I think you know what I want:—
   </p>
   
   <p>
      <u>1st. Lincoln</u>: Mr. Rice<sup><a href="#loc.02206_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> has got
      the ambition of editing a work that <u>can</u> never be 
       superseded.<sup><a href="#loc.03286_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> He proposes to get every man of note now living who ever
      met Lincoln to write down in plain words and as accurately as the human memory will
      record, just what Lincoln did; just how Lincoln looked; just what impression Lincoln
      made on him. However, he does <u>not</u> want the last clause
      (that is to say, the impressions) recorded by anybody but only by men whose names
      will go down to history. Like Gradgrind,<sup><a href="#loc.03286_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> "what he
      wants is <u>facts</u>." 
   </p>
   
   <p> You, of course, are among the favored few whose impressions will be acceptable; so,
      you see, if you will write down an account of every interview you ever had with
      Lincoln, <u>that</u> will complete what I ask of you in his name on that subject. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
      <u>2d Memoires of the War.</u>
      
   </p>
   
   <p> He would like from you an account of some phase of the Civil War which you
      witnessed. But I will see you before you have time, <u>probably</u>, to write the second article, and, <u>possible</u>, I may be able to suggest the best topic from his point 
       of view to begin
      with. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Now, my dear Walt Whitman, won't you go to work at once because Rice is chained
      lightning in a dress suit and damned impatient. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Redpath (1833–1891),
      an antislavery activist, journalist, and longtime friend of Whitman, was the
      author of <em>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown</em> (Boston:
      Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the <em>New York
         Tribune</em> during the war, and the originator of the "Lyceum" lectures. He
      met Whitman in Boston in 1860 and remained an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 9
      vols., 3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp." Redpath became
      editor of <em>The North American Review</em> in November 1886. See
      also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins, 1926);

         Making of Nineteenth-Century America</em> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University
      Press, 2008); and J.R. LeMaster, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_46.html">Redpath, James [1833–1891]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
