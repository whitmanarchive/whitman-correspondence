      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      It has just occurred
      to me that a proper epigraph
      for the appendix
      might be found in Milton's
      <u>Areopagitica: a Speech
         for the Liberty of Unlicensed
         Printing</u>. There is no copy
      of Milton's prose works
      
      in the Treasury library,
      and it is almost impossible
      for me to get down
      to the Congressional Library
      during office hours,
      I am so tied up; but
      you can easily slip into
      one of the Philadelphia
      libraries, and look over
      the treatise. It is many
      years since I have seen
      this—the most eloquent
      of Milton's prose writings,
      but from what I remember
      
      of it, I should think
      a fitting epigraph could
      be culled from it.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      If I can contrive
      to get tomorrow to the
      Congressional, I will look
      myself, but this is doubtful,
      for affairs are on me. It
      is quite infernal that there
      is no library open to us
      here after office hours.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I am laboring under
      a heavy cold—influenza—and
      feel miserable.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      If you see Howard
      Furness, he could help you
      to an epigraph. So could
      I, in short metre, if I could
      only get at a decent library.
      
   </p>
