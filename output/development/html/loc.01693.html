   <p>I was expecting to visit New York early this month, and intended to call and thank
      you for your beautiful 
      and valued gift of Hesperia—but finding I shall not go now for two or three weeks,
      I write to acknowledge the receipt of the poem and to say that when I come on, I shall
      personally call and pay my respects.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01693_n1">1. Walt Whitman was acquainted
      with Cora Tappan (then Cora Hatch) in 1857. He mentioned her in his June 20,
      1857 letter to Sarah Tyndale; see Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> (New York: New York University Press,
      1961–1977), 1:42–44. Tappan, born in 1840 in Cuba, New York, was a
      medium. At age ten, as she sat with slate and pencil in hand, "she lost external
      consciousness, and on awaking she found her slate covered with writing." At
      fourteen she was a public speaker, and at sixteen married Dr. B. F. Hatch, who
      published and wrote an introduction to her <em>Discourses on
         Religion, Morals, Philosophy, and Metaphysics</em> (1858). In 1871, now Cora
      Tappan, she published a collection of poems entitled <em>Hesperia</em>; the section "Laus Natura" was dedicated to "Walt Whitman,
      the Poet of Nature." See also Emma Hardinge, <em>Modern American
         Spiritualism</em> (New York, 1870), 149.<a href="#r1">[back]
