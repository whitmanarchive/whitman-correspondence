   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07305_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey U.S.A. It is postmarked:
      London | AM | JU 3 | 89 | Canada; Camden, N.J. | Jun | 4 | 12 M | 1889 |
      Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07233_n3">2. The Buckes had three
      daughters and five sons: Clare Georgina (1866–1867), Maurice Andrews
      (1868–1899), Jessie Clare (1870–1943), William Augustus
      (1873–1933), Edward Pardee (1875–1913), Ina Matilda
      (1877–1968), Harold Langmuir (1879–1951), and Robert Walpole
      (1881–1923).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03027_n4">3. For Whitman's seventieth
      birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
      the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
      (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.30.html">Tuesday, May 7, 1889</a>. The day was celebrated with a testimonial
      dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
      addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
      arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07305_n2">4. For Whitman's thoughts about
      his 70th birthday dinner, see his 
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy and his  letter to Bucke. See also Whitman's  letter to Traubel, regarding the published volume of birthday
      speeches <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em>
      (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1889).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">5. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01172_n2">6. In his pamphlet <em>Mr. Donnelly's Reviewers</em> (Chicago: Belford, Clarke &amp;
      Co., 1889), William D. O'Connor attempted to defend Ignatius Loyola Donnelly's
      Baconian argument—his theory that Shakespeare's plays had been written by
      Francis Bacon—an idea Donnelly wrote about in his book <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in Shakespeare's Plays</em>,
      published in 1888.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07305_n4">7. According to Traubel,
      Whitman mentioned that Kennedy and Bucke had reported liking O'Connor's book in
      letters he received on June 4, 1889. Whitman was almost certainly referring to
      this letter from Bucke, as well as Kennedy's letter of ; see also Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.58.html">Tuesday, June 4, 1889</a>.<a href="#r7">[back]
