   <p>Just a few lines to acknowledge receipt by last mail of the copy of
      Ingersoll's<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r2">2</a></sup> Address<sup><a href="#loc.02462_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> which
      you so kindly sent &amp; to thank you very cordially for it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have read it through with intense interest and pleasure &amp; I regard it as a
      valuable contribution to "Whitman Literature"—from Ingersollism the best
      that has yet been given—significant both from what he has said &amp; left
      unsaid for he has left untouched
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>what I regard as the main &amp; vital element in <u>L of G</u>
      vis the spirituality which permeates &amp; animates every page, every line &amp;
      is the inspiring element in your teaching. But as we could not expect <u>him</u> to recognise this we must be thankful for what we
      have got, as, apart from this, the address is really a wonderful bit of work
      &amp; will, I think, rank as one of his most brilliant oratorical achievements.
      I shall prize the pamphlet very highly for its own sake, but more so because <u>you</u> have sent it to me &amp; I again thank you for
      your great kindness in doing so.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>It is the intention of "the boys" to have the whole of it read aloud at the next
      meeting of the "College" (Feb 9th).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>During the last week I have been a little uneasy about you, &amp; wondering at
      times how you were, &amp; I accepted the pamphlet as a message that all was well
      with you. But today I have been grieved to read the following par:[agraph] in
      the London <u>Daily Graphic</u>:—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A post card received from Walt Whitman says "Am having an extra bad spell these
      days. May blow over may not"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This is indeed bad news for me &amp; for all your friends</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>here &amp; I sincerely hope that by this time the "extra bad spell" is blowing
      over &amp; that you are through the worst of it. We shall be most anxious until
      we receive some more definite news &amp; I have asked Warry<sup><a href="#loc.00668_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> to send me word in case you are unable to do so.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There has been a great change in the weather here—all the first &amp; snow
      have gone &amp; we have lately had a continuous spell of "open" weather.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>With kindest regards to all the members of your household &amp; with best love to
      yourself
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I remain</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,

   <p id="n0839">2. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.00668_n4">4. Frederick Warren Fritzinger
      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,
      535).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n6121">5. James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
