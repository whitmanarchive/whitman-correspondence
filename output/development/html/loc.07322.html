   <p>Ed. Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r2">2</a></sup> turned up last evening with the parcel of photos, prints &amp;c fourteen in
      all, a grand collection, some of them I had not seen before or not in that shape.
      They make an immensely valuable addition to my "W.W. Collection" and I am
      wonderfully pleased to have them and thank you a thousand times. I go to
      Guelph—Ont. this evening to attend a murder trial, shall be back tomorrow
      evening. Ed. gave a very good account of you all, I had not time to talk to him much
      (a lot of people at the home) but he is coming soon to see me again. He seemed sorry
      to leave Camden but
      thought he ought to be at his studies. A very encouraging letter from Willy
      Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r3">3</a></sup>—All going well with him and the meter there in Danbury, Conn. and he hopes
      to be quite through very soon now. Cloudy but pleasant weather. Not cold.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey U.S.A. It is postmarked:

   <p id="n4319">2. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4284">3. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
