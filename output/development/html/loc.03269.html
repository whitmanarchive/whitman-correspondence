      <br></br><br></br> Dear Mr Whitman 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>At last I [
      <span class="unclear">match?</span>]
       half
      an hour from the everlasting sound of 
      socalled
      
       business for something real something pleasant. 
   </p>
   
   <p>The sight even of your name above bring a healthy puff of honest air into my stuffy
      little cabin. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Here saw at the other end of grand old Pennsylvania in a dusky town of iron &amp;
      smoke. Rude nature seems to have [
      <span class="unclear">born?</span>]
       a rude race of sons and given them a share of
      her  unconscious
      honesty &amp; self [
      <span class="unclear">forgetful?</span>]
       beauty. Here I am sure enough but my thoughts &amp; what I
      fancy the best part of my self are with you in your cozy study at Camden. 
   </p>
   
   <p>My first thought is, how are you in body and nerves? Well? I hope, at the very least
      better! I'll answer for it you are well enough in mind. The mere sight of your
      cheery card humour and the mind contuse with your grand philosophy of good will
      bring peace and hope. 
   </p>
   
   <p>They brought them to a very tough youngster whose worth is horribly twisted by the
      bitter herb of [
      <span class="unclear">Sardinia?</span>]
      : that [
      <span class="unclear">galling?</span>]
      
      [
      <span class="unclear">flavor?</span>]
       of time &amp; talents wasted that is in my every waking sleeping
      thought. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Bah! you will say what is the matter with the boy that he should write me all this
      [
      <span class="unclear">taffy?</span>]
      . Quite true!
      for if I were to spoil [
      <span class="unclear">means?</span>]
       I could only say again and ever again, "I have seen "Walt Whitman" &amp;
      I know what "comradeship" is!" At this Xmas season it is [
      <span class="unclear">our custom?</span>]
       to send greeting. At all time my fond
      wishes are for your health &amp; happiness &amp; for that other never to be named
      Nirvana you giant seers strive after. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Heartiest greeting for Xmas &amp; many many happy New Years to all your home circle,
      not omitting the happy little canary 
   </p>
