      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You will, no doubt be surprised, when you see the signature to this letter, but. I
      have often been tempted to write you—to thank you for your kindness in writing
      to my boy<sup><a href="#loc.04506_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—far away in the Sierra Madre mountains—and
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>always gladly welcoming any letters from his old home—and, especially from <u>you</u>—who have <u>so</u> many
      correspondents—and have also suffered from extreme indisposition, he has
      appreciated particularly your thought of him—&amp; been much
      pleased—&amp; his mother also shares with him the same feeling—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have once or twice learned, thro' the papers, of your ill health—with much
      regret—and, we are always interested when we see your
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>name—in print—</p>
   
   
   <p>I received a letter from John today—in which he mentions having heard from you
      &amp; that he had received a card also—he has had an attack of
      Pneumonia—his first sickness since he has been out there—and, is much
      weakened by it—and. I realise how very far away he is—and feel anxious
      about him—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will not trespass further on your time but hope you are</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>regaining your strength and much improved—Alice<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r3">3</a></sup> unites with me in very kind
      remembrances—
   </p>

      Yours very truly

      the younger son of Mrs. Caroline Wroth, who was the wife of a Philadelphia
      importer, at whose residence (319 Stevens Street, Camden) Whitman took his meals
      for a period of time beginning in July 1881. Johnny moved with his mother and
      his brother James Henry ("Harry") Wroth to Albuquerque, New Mexico, soon after,
