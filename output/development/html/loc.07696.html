   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Dr Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario Canada. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | Aug
      29 | 8 PM | 89.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n4971">2. Henry Mills Alden (1836–1919)
      was managing editor of <em>Harper's Weekly</em> from 1863 to 1869
      and editor of <em>Harper's Monthly Magazine</em> from 1869 until
      his death.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07699_n3">3. Whitman mentions Dick Flynn in his , letter to Thomas
      Nicholson. Like Nicholson, Flynn was an employee at Bucke's asylum, doing odd jobs.
      Whitman came to know him during his visit to the asylum in 1880
      and admired Flynn's gardening. Flynn took a tour of the U.S. in 1889 and visted Whitman
      Camden home, where he carried the Gutekunst photographic portrait
      of Whitman back to Dr. Bucke in London Ontario. Whitman and Bucke both greatly admired
      this <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/image110.html?sort=photographer&amp;order=ascending&amp;page=3">photographic portrait</a>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">4. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07696_n2">5. Whitman paid a city tax of
      $25.28 on August 24 and a water tax bill for $8.40 on August 28. Of the former
      he wrote: "In Italy &amp; Greece they have a dis-illegal banditti— here we
      have a regular legal one, &amp; numerous &amp; remorseless" (Whitman's Commonplace Book [Charles
      E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.]).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">6. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
