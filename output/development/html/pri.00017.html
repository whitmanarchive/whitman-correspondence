      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I should like to have you prepared for any thing that <u>might</u> happen, now or in future—As it may be that out of this hubbub some one in London
      may take a notion to rush &amp; crudely reprint my books—I send you (same mail with this)
      full &amp; corrected copies of my two volumes, prepared for the printers, 
      for a London edition, with an especial Preface note—&amp; altogether as I should like
      to have the books 
      brought out, for permanent reading &amp; investigation in Europe.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My dear friend, I authorise you to make any arrangement about publishing, terms, &amp;c. you think best—only the
      books
      
      must be printed verbatim &amp; entire, if at all, &amp; in Two Volumes—(You will see 
      what I have authorized to be put at bottom of title pages.)<sup><a href="#pri.00017_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dowden wrote to me lately a word on this matter, relating however only to <u>Two Rivulets</u> 
      (proposed Chatto. &amp; Windus, at a venture)<sup><a href="#pri.00017_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I shall tell D. that I have placed these copies in your hands—&amp; shall (if you have no objection)
      
      consider him to be join'd with you in the matter of deciding, negotiating, terms, &amp;c. of the publishing, 
      (should such come to pass)—&amp; whatever you twain think well to do, under those conditions,
      
      in said matter, I hereby warrant &amp; endorse.

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
