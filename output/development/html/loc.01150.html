   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.01150_n3">3. On March 27 Whitman wrote
      in his Commonplace Book: "Am writing this in my new premises in Mickle
      Street—slept here last night—the plumbers are here at work at gas
      &amp; water fixings, &amp; the carpenter—Mr and Mrs Lay" (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). On April 3 he "paid $1750 cash for the premises 328
      Mickle Street, Camden, to Rebecca Jane Hare, &amp; took the deed, which I left
      at the Register's office to be recorded" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Whitman
      had royalties from the Philadelphia editions amounting to $1250, and he borrowed
      $500 from George W. Childs (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.73.html">Saturday, June 9, 1888</a>). The bill of sale, in Whitman's hand, is in
      the Walt Whitman House at Camden: "Camden, March 19, 1884, Received Sixteen
      dollars from Mrs: Lay, the rent in advance for house in Mickle St.—It is
      understood that if Mr Whitman before the end of April buys the house, this $16
      is to be deducted from the price $1800. | R Jennie Hare." | "I agree to sell
      Walt Whitman the premises 328 Mickle Street for Seventeen Hundred and Fifty
      Dollars cash instead of 1800 dollars. | R Jenne Hare." <em>Howe's
         Camden City Directory</em> for 1883 listed as the occupant at 328 Mickle
      Street Mrs. Ellen Hare, a dressmaker and a widow. No mention of "R Jennie" or
      "Rebecca Jane" appears in the directories in the 1880s. On March 23 Whitman
      handed his sister-in-law a "rough statement" of the sums paid to her for board
      from June, 1873, to March, 1884, a period of 560 weeks, during which time he was
      not in Camden for 143 weeks. The total paid was $1501—"ab't $3.60 a week
      for the time boarded" (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r3">[back]
