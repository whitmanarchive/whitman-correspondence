      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Good news! The book on you wh. I had been contemplating
      for some years is coming bravely to the birth.<sup><a href="#loc.02893_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> It has
      burst from me as from a ripe pomegranate its seeds, come from me with throes. I have
      been 2 weeks in a fever of parturition &amp; have gone over all the notes writings,
      &amp; literature of my past life in relentless search for material to enrich the book
      on my hero. (It ought to be studded with jewels
      &amp; written on gold &amp; silver in 
      yr
      
       honor.) The longer I live the more I understand &amp; grow up to 
      yr
      
       incomparable poems. I have made a 25 
      p.
      
       bibliography of you. Be sure to hunt around now,—that's a good boy—&amp; send me articles
      or references to articles &amp;c wh. you think will help to
      make any 
      bibliog
      
       complete. I have already I 
      shd
      
       think nearly a hundred entries. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Please don't tell anyone of my project yet—wd you? </p>
   
   
   <p> I have spent two days unearthing the Oliver Stevens matter.<sup><a href="#loc.02893_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I find Oliver to be a capital Pfaafian fellow, generous
      &amp; free &amp; entirely innocent—a mere cat's paw for others. I have
      discovered the real instigator, &amp; it forms a very pretty piece of business. I am
      going to put him in the stocks for all time. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I am working out the grouping &amp; laws of 
      yr
      
       poetry. 
   </p>
   
   <p> But my chief object is to propagandize. I am going to address the <u>American People</u> (not the damned &amp; twice damned
      literary &amp; clerical rascals). It's my firm belief that if these scoundrels could
      be passed—their scowling ranks—you 
      cd
      
       reach the people—your true audience. I have constructed a chain of
      proofs of 
      yr
      
       rank in the Valhalla of great men, which I am going to present in a
      temperate, calm &amp; persuasive way. Then in Part II, I make an analysis of the
      poems &amp; all their vast implications &amp; ancillary topics: this  Part will of
      course be for the Whitman fellows throughout the world. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Knortz<sup><a href="#uva.00476_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> has been at me twice to make this book, &amp; I
      hope you will not be displeased, &amp; also hope my time will not be taken up but
      that I can finish it soon. But I am going to read widely and deeply for it. Dr.
      Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r5">5</a></sup> book's is invaluable, but it lacks profundity<sup><a href="#loc.02893_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; literary knack in its treatment of the work
      (analysis) &amp; estimate of the problems involved. In fact I find it quite
      inadequate in these respects. 
   </p>
   
   <p> What 
      wd
      
       you say to having the book, when completed, brought out simultaneously in
      Glasgow &amp; New York? I 
      shd
      
       thus get copyright in both countries. Do you think I will have much
      trouble in getting publisher? If Wilson &amp; McCormick 
      wd
      
       co-operate the expense 
      cd
      
       be halved, I suppose.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02893_n6">1. This letter is addressed: Mr
      Walt Whitman | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked: BELMONT | FEB | [illegible]; CAMDEN, N.J. | FEB | [illegible].<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02893_n1">2. As euphoric as Kennedy
      sounds in this letter, his book-length study of Whitman would not see the light
      of day until 1896, when it was published as <em>Reminiscences of
         Walt Whitman</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02893_n2">3. Kennedy is likely referring
      to an incident four years prior, when Oliver Stevens, District Attorney in
      Boston, wrote to the publisher of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>: "We
      are of the opinion that this book is such a book as brings it within the
      provisions of the Public Statutes respecting obscene literature and suggest the
      propriety of withdrawing the same from circulation and suppressing the editions
      thereof" and asked Whitman to censor certain passages (The Library of Congress;
      <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [1902], 10
      vols., 8:290).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00476_n1">4. Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02893_n3">6. He is referring to Bucke's
      <em>Walt Whitman</em> (1883), heavily edited by Whitman
      himself.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0259">7. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0473">8. According to the <em>Dictionary of
         American Biography</em>, Nora Perry (1831–1896) was a poet,
      journalist, and author of juvenile books. Perry published a qualified defense of
      Whitman, entitled "A Few Words About Walt Whitman," in <em>Appleton's Journal</em>, 15 (22 April 1876), 531–533. She was a
      friend of William Douglas O'Connor; see his letter to John Burroughs on May 4,
      1876, in which he called her "a perfect pussy-cat" (Estelle Doheny Collection of
      the Edward Laurence Doheny Memorial Library, St. John's Seminary; Clara Barrus,
      <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [1931], 130).<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="loc.02893_n4">9. Fannie Raymond Ritter
      (c.1835–1891) was an American musician, writer and historian and the wife
      of the German-American composer Frédéric Louis Ritter
      (1834–1891). The Ritters were friends of Kennedy and William D. O'Connor,
      and they had invited Whitman for a visit in 1876.<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="loc.02893_n5">10. Helen Price was the daughter
      of Abby H. Price (1814–1878) and Edmund Price. During the late 1850s and
      throughout the 1860s, Abby and Helen were friends with Whitman and his mother,
      and the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
      Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's 1883 biography of Whitman. For
