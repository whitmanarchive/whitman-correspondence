      <br></br><br></br>My dear Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I have your kind favor of the 11th with the enclosed poem—or series of poems,
      rather. It does not seem to me that Fancies at the Navesink will make a favorable
      impression upon our readers—though they might upon a select few. I must
      therefore return them.<sup><a href="#loc.05931_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With thanks,
      <br></br>Sincerely yours,
      <br></br>H. M. Alden.
