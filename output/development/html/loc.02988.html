      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am going to ask you to do something for me,—or shall I say something for
      William<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup>,—it will be for us both.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is this—will you write a prefatory notice, a memoir, or whatever it may be,
      as brief or long as you will, for a volume of his stories that I want to collect +
      publish with the new one that has not yet been printed, "The Brazen Android;"—As soon as
      William passed away his friends began to say that I ought to collect + reprint his
      stories,—but only now has it taken any shape,—&amp; now I think I see
      the way to do it, to put the <u>seven</u> into one volume, and I am sure that any
      publisher will take it for me, if only it has your word of preface. It will I know
      make the volume sell; &amp; it will be a great thing for me.
   </p>
   
   <p>Any data that you may want I shall be very glad to furnish you.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>I feel a great <u>hope</u> rise up in me at this idea, dear Walt, &amp; hope that
      you can &amp; will do it. 
   </p>

      With love &amp; congratulations on your coming birth-day, as ever—the
      same

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
