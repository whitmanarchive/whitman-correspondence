   <p>In my yesterdays letter I said something about the acknowledgement of the moneys &nbsp;I
      fear that I did not express myself so that you could understand me &nbsp;I do not want
      to get the credit of sending money that I dont send,—I want to show your letters to those that contribute so that they may see that
      all the money they give me is duly sent and appropriated and as I proposed this regular contribution I dont like to have them know that I am the first one to back out, but as I said yesterday
      I think that whatever I possibly can do I ought to do for Andrew, that whatever I
      can give ought to be given to him. Andrew is in a bad fix, he is hardly able to get
      around and has no money &nbsp;Mat sends him at least one good meal a day. He generally
      comes and spends an hour or two at the house. I had quite a talk with Dr Ruggles<sup><a href="#loc.00425_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> yesterday about him. The Dr says that had he gone to the interior when he first advised
      him to in the summer he would have stood a fair chance of getting well, but that now
      he thinks that it is more than wicked to take his money and make beleive to cure him for in his opinion that is almost impossible &nbsp;I think that it is about so. It makes one feel
      rather bad when you think of it dont it &nbsp;Ruggles says that his lungs are much diseased. I wish that you could come home
      for a short time and see Andrew &nbsp;Mother and the rest are quite well. This morning
      mother is not quite so well,—a bad cold—yesterday Jess was sick all day—there is no
      doubt Walt in my mind but that Mother is doing injury both to herself and Jess by
      her economy &nbsp;they do not have enough <em>good</em> things to eat, and they are both of the age that they require it. I have spoken of
      it till I have tired and it dont accomplish any-thing. I wish you was at home to give a little advice now and then.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Walt I often think of you wonder what you are about and how you get along. Do you
      have any employment there. You must often meet Brooklyn people there &nbsp;I understand
      that they liked your letter at the Times. Twas superior to the Brooklyn one I'm sure.<sup><a href="#loc.00425_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt let me hear from you—a letter that I can show Lane &amp;c &nbsp;They like to read your
      letters &nbsp;Mattie and the babies are well and send their love. Ruggles always tells
      me to remember him to you. Probasco<sup><a href="#loc.00425_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> complains that he has not heard from you since he sent you some money, fears that
      it did not reach you &nbsp;I will write again soon

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

      <em>New York Times</em> printed Walt Whitman's "Letter from
      Washington." This wide-ranging article discussed such matters as the beauties of
      Washington, the progress on the Capitol Dome, army ambulances, and the quality
      of light in the city (Emory Holloway, ed., <em>The Uncollected
         Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman</em> [Garden City, New York: Doubleday,
      Page and Company, 1921], 2:29–36). "From Washington" appeared in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Union</em> of September 22, 1863 (<em>The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman</em>, [1921],
