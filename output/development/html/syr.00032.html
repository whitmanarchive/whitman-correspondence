      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter came yesterday—also the liquorice powder—I have no doubt the
      powder will be good for me.<sup><a href="#syr.00032_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I have already begun
      it—I am as well as usual with me—up, and at my window, as now—get
      out with the horse &amp; wagon every afternoon but shall not to-day—nothing
      new in my affairs—get along quite comfortably—have some visitors—a
      canny Scotchman, a literary man, but a good jovial fellow, elderly with a humorous
      turn, &amp; much reminiscence, has been in this forenoon to see me—I like to
      have him—It is a raw, dark, rainy day—I wish I could have you here to
      eat a bite of dinner with me, &amp; chat for the afternoon—Several of my
      friends have had your little book,<sup><a href="#syr.00032_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> lent them by
      me—Scovel (with his lawyer's head)<sup><a href="#n1049" id="r4">4</a></sup> said to me after reading it, "there can be
      no doubt of it"—i e that B[acon] is the true author—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="syr.00032_n2">2. On , O'Connor sent the powder for
      Whitman's constipation, and reported, "My special trouble now is what they call
      schlerosis—an induration of the lower part of the spinal cord, a bequest
      of the inflammation caused by the nervous prostration."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n1049">4. James Matlock Scovel began to
      practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War he was in the New Jersey
      legislature, and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned actively for Horace
      Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S. Treasury during Chester
      Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home
      for Sunday breakfast, as he did on December 2 and 9, 1877 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a description of
      these breakfasts, see <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed.
      William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel,
      see George R. Prowell's <em>The History of Camden County, New
         Jersey</em> (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886).<a href="#r4">[back]
