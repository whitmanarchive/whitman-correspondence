      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I must write again, out of a full heart. For the reading of this book "The Two
      Rivulets" has filled it very full—Ever the deep inward assent, rising up
      strong, exultant, my immortal self recognizing, responding to your immortal self.
      Ever the sense of dearness  —the sweet subtle perfume, pervading every page, every line
      to my sense—O I cannot put into any words what I perceive nor what answering
      emotion pervades me, flows out towards you—sweetest deepest greatest
      experience of my life—what I was made for—surely I was made as the soil
      in which the precious seed of your thoughts &amp; emotions should be
      planted—try to fulfil themselves in me, that I might  by &amp; bye blossom into beauty &amp;
      bring forth rich fruits—immortal fruits—So no doubt other women feel,
      and future women will.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Do not dissuade me from coming this autumn my dearest Friend—I have waited
      patiently 7 years—patiently yet often, especially since your illness with such
      painful yearning your heart would yearn towards me if you realized it—I cannot
      wait any longer. Nor ought I to—that would indeed be sacrificing the prudence
      that concerns itself with immortal things to the prudence that concerns itself only
      with temporary  ones.
      But, indeed, even so far as this latter is concerned, there is no sacrifice
      required for any. It is by far the best step, for
      instance, I could take on Beatrice's
      account She is heartily in earnest in her medical studies—I am persuaded, too,
      it is a splendid training for her whether or no she ever makes a money earning
      profession of it. And in England women have at present, no means of obtaining a
      complete  medical
      education. They cannot get admission to any Hospital for the clinical part of the
      course—So that she is exceedingly anxious to come where it is possible for her
      to follow out her aims effectually. Then, I am confident she will find America
      congenial to her—that she is in her essential nature democratic—&amp;
      that she has the intelligence, the sympathies earnestness affectionateness,
      unconventionality needed to pierce through appearances surface "crudeness" &amp; see
      &amp; love the great reality unfolding  below. So I believe has Herby. Then an artist is as free as an author to
      work where he pleases—reaps as much from fresh and widened experiences. He
      does not contemplate cutting himself off from England—will exhibit
      here—very likely take a studio in London for a season, a couple of years hence
      to work among old friends &amp; associations, &amp; so have double chance &amp;
      opportunities. Then above all, dearest  friend they too see America in &amp;
      through you—they too would fain be near you. Have no anxiety or misgivings for
      us. Let us come &amp; be near you—&amp; see if we are made of the right sort
      of stuff for transplanting to American soil. Only advise us [
      <span class="unclear">where.</span>]
       If it be Philadelphia
      (which as far as offering facilities for Beatrice would, as far as I can learn, suit
      us very well  We must
      not come I think till the end of October because of its being so full—Perhaps
      indeed dearest Friend (but I dare not build on it) we shall talk this over in
      England—If you are able to take the journey, it might, and would be sure to do
      you good as well as to rejoice the hearts of English friends. But if not, if we are
      not able to talk over our coming, do not feel the least anxious about us. We shall
      light on our feet &amp; do very well; Percy
      seems getting on fairly well considering what a bad time it is in his  line of business. I
      think he will be able to marry this autumn or following winter—I shall go and
      spend a month with him in July. Perhaps indeed if as many are prophecying the iron
      trade does not recover its old pre-eminence here—he may be glad by &amp; bye
      that I have gone over to America &amp; opened a way for him. But if he does not
      follow me then, if I live, I hope to spend a few months with him every three or four
       years, instead of
      as now a few weeks once a year. Anyhow we have to live widely apart.—Thanks
      for the papers just received. Specially welcome the account of some stranger's
      interview with you— for me too before very long now the joy of hearing the
      "strong musical voice," read the "Wound Dresser" or speak. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have happy thoughts for my companions all day long, helping me over every
      difficulty—strengthening me. 
   </p>

      Goodbye dearest Friend. Love from us all.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
