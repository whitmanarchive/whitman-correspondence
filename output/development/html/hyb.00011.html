      <br></br><br></br>Dear Hank—
      
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>Dear boy—your letter rec'd &amp; read—Take it easy about the minister
      &amp; the Ingersoll business<sup><a href="#nyp.00421_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—the best answer you
      can make is to be quiet &amp; good natured &amp; even attentive &amp; <em>not get mad worth a cent</em>—True religion (<em>the most beautiful thing in the whole world</em>, &amp; the best
      part of any man's or woman's, or boy's character) consists in <em>what
         one does</em> square and kind &amp; generous &amp; honorable all days, <em>all the time</em>—&amp; especially with his own folks &amp;
      associates &amp; with the poor &amp; illiterate &amp; in devout meditation, &amp;
      silent thoughts of God, &amp; death—&amp; not at all in what he <em>says</em>, nor in Sunday or prayer meeting <em>gas</em>—My own opinion is that Ingersoll <em>talks</em>
      too much on his side—a <em>good life</em>, <em>steady trying to do fair</em>, &amp; a sweet, tolerant liberal disposition,
      shines like the sun, tastes like the fresh air of a May morning, blooms like a
      perfect little flower by the road-side—&amp; all the blowing, talking &amp;
      powowing <em>both sides</em> amounts to little or nothing—Glad,
      dear boy, you had a good little visit, you &amp; Mont,<sup><a href="#nyp.00421_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      with me—I enjoyed it too—I am writing this up in the room—the sun
      shines, but sharp cold &amp; the wind whistling—
   </p>
