      <br></br><br></br>Dear Abby, &amp; Dear Helen, not forgetting Emmy, &amp; all
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I am sitting here alone in the parlor, the sun near setting pleasantly &amp; brightly,
      
      (though cold to-day,) I just think that I ought to write you, even if but a line—that
      I am neglecting you—that perhaps you will be glad enough to hear from me. Well, 
      I am still here—still alive, after quite a many pretty hard pulls &amp; pressures—maintain
      pretty good spirits—which <em>would</em> be, quite 
      <em>first-rate &amp; good</em>—but every day 
      &amp; every night comes the thought of my mother—I am not despondent or blue, nor disposed
      
      to be any more <em>ennuyeed</em> than ever—but that thought remains to temper the rest of my life.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am probably improving, though very slowly—go out a little most every day—go over
      to Philadelphia—get along pretty well in the cars &amp; crossing the ferry. 
      (The car fellows &amp; ferrymen are very kind &amp; helpful—almost all know me, I suppose
      instinctively)—appetite fair—rest at night tolerable—general strength better than
      at any time—(it is now just a year since I was paralyzed.) Can't use my left leg yet
      with any freedom—bad spells in the head too frequent yet—then, with all those, I am
      certainly encouraged 
      to believe I am on the gain. (But I am not out of the woods yet.) I write some—(must
      occupy my mind.) I am writing some pieces in the Weekly Graphic—my reminiscences 
      of war times—first number appears in <em>Weekly Graphic</em> of Jan. 24<sup><a href="#pml.00041_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—three or four others to follow—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are in the new house my brother has built—very nice. I find myself <em>very</em><sup><a href="#pml.00041_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup><em>lonesome</em> here, for all social &amp; emotional consolation—(Man cannot live on <em>bread alone</em>—can he?)—I want to come &amp; see you—must do so before long—want to pay a moderate board,
      
      (same as I do here,) if convenient for you to have me—<em>Shall not come on any other condition</em>—Well, Abby, I have just <em>skurried</em> rapidly over the sheet, 
      &amp; will send it to you just as it is, with love.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pml.00041_n1">1. On the basis of the
      reference to his illness and the appearance of articles in the New York <em>Weekly Graphic</em>, January 11, 1874, a Sunday, appears to be
      a plausible date; January 18, 1874, however, cannot be ruled out.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00041_n2">2. "'Tis But Ten Years
      Since" appeared in the New York <em>Weekly Graphic</em> from
      January 24 to March 7, 1874. For a discussion of these articles, see Thomas O.
      Mabbott and Rollo G. Silver, <em>American Literature</em>, 15
      (1943), 51–62. Later these articles appeared in <em>Memoranda During the War</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
