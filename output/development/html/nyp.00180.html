   <p>Tom,<sup><a href="#nyp.00180_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> I thought I would write you a few words, and take chances of its getting to you—though
      there is great excitement now about the Army of the Potomac,<sup><a href="#nyp.00180_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> no passes allowed, mails held over, &amp;c. &amp;c.—still I thought I would write, and take
      chances.
   </p> 
   
   <p>There is nothing very special here about Washington—they seem to be shoving troops
      off from here now all the time, in small or large bodies—the convalescents are doing
      guard duty &amp;c in the Hospitals—even the old regiments doing patrol, &amp; provost, are
      sent off. So I suppose something is up. Tom, I was at Armory last evening, saw Lewy
      Brown,<sup><a href="#nyp.00180_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup> sat with him a good while, he was very cheerful, told me how he laid out to do, when
      he got well enough to go from hospital, (which he expects soon), says he intends to
      go home to Maryland, go to school, and learn to write better, and learn a little bookkeeping,
      &amp;c.—so that he can be fit for some light employment. Lew is so good, so affectionate—when
      I came away, he reached up his face, I put my arm around him, and we gave each other
      a long kiss, half a minute long. We talked about you while I was there. I saw Hiram<sup><a href="#nyp.00180_n6" id="r4">4</a></sup> but did not speak to him. He lay pale and pretty sick, sound asleep. I could not
      help stopping before I came away, and looking at him—it was pitiful to see him, so
      pale, sound asleep—Poor Hiram—he is a good boy—he gets no better. Johnny Mahay<sup><a href="#nyp.00180_n7" id="r5">5</a></sup> does not get any better, in Ward E. He is going to have an operation performed on
      him by Dr. Bliss.<sup><a href="#nyp.00180_n8" id="r6">6</a></sup> Tom, I do not know who you was most intimate with in the Hospital, or I would write
      you about them.
   </p>
   
   <p>As to me, there is nothing new with me, or my affairs. I manage to pay my way here
      in Washington, what I make writing letters for the New York papers, &amp;c. When I stopped
      here, last January, on my return from Falmouth, I thought I would stop only a few
      days, before returning to New York, and see if I could not get some berth, clerkship
      or something—but I have not pushed strong enough—have not got anything—and I don't
      know as I could be satisfied with the life of a clerk in the departments anyhow. So
      I have hung along here ever since. I guess I enjoy a kind of vagabond life any how.
      I go around some, nights, when the spirit moves me, sometimes to the gay places, just
      to see the sights. Tom, I wish you was here. Somehow I don't find the comrade that
      suits me to a dot—and I won't have any other, not for good.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, Tom, the war news is not lovely, is it? We feel disappointed here about Charleston<sup><a href="#nyp.00180_n9" id="r7">7</a></sup>—I felt as blue about it as anybody. I was so in hopes they would take the conceit
      out of that gassy city. It seems to me always as if Charleston has done the biggest
      business of blowing &amp; mischief, on a small capital of industry or manliness, of any
      city the world ever knew. But for all our bad success at Charleston, and even if we
      fail for a while elsewhere, I believe this Union will conquer in the end, as sure
      as there's a God in heaven. This country can't be broken up by Jeff Davis, &amp; all his
      damned crew. Tom, I sometimes feel as if I didn't want to live—life would have no
      charm for me, if this country should fail after all, and be reduced to take a third
      rate position, to be domineered over by England &amp; France &amp; the haughty nations of
      Europe &amp;c and we unable to help ourselves. But I have no thought that will ever be,
      this country I hope would spend her last drop of blood, and last dollar, rather than
      submit to such humiliation.
   </p>
   
   <p>O I hope Hooker<sup><a href="#nyp.00180_n10" id="r8">8</a></sup> will have good success in his plans, whatever they may be. We have been foiled so
      often in our plans, it seems as though it was too much. And our noble Army of the
      Potomac, so brave, so capable, so full of good men, I really believe they are this
      day the best in the world. God grant Hooker may have success, and his brave boys may
      at last achieve the victory they deserve. O how much I think about them though. I
      suppose that does no good. Tom, you tell the boys of your company there is an old
      pirate up in Washington, with the white wool growing all down his neck—an old comrade
      who thinks about you &amp; them every day, for all he don't know them, and will probably
      never see them, but thinks about them as comrades &amp; younger brothers of his, just
      the same.<sup><a href="#nyp.00180_n11" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>These lines may never reach you, as it is talked here that the Army of the Potomac
      is in for a real fighting march, at last, may be something desperate, it may continue
      some time when it once begins. Tom, I thought I would write you a few words, hoping
      they might reach you. Dear comrade, you must not forget me, for I never shall you.
      My love you have in life or death forever. I don't know how you feel about it, but
      it is the wish of my heart to have your friendship, and also that if you should come
      safe out of this war, we should come together again in some place where we could make
      our living, and be true comrades and never be separated while life lasts—and take
      Lew Brown too, and never separate from him. Or if things are not so to be—if you get
      these lines, my dear, darling comrade, and any thing should go wrong, so that we do
      not meet again, here on earth, it seems to me, (the way I feel now,) that my soul
      could never be entirely happy, even in the world to come, without you, dear comrade.<sup><a href="#nyp.00180_n12" id="r10">10</a></sup> And if it is God's will, I hope we shall yet meet, as I say, if you feel as I do
      about it—and if [it] is destined that we shall not, you have my love none the less,
      whatever should keep you from me, no matter how many years. God bless you, Tom, and
      preserve you through the perils of the fight.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good bye, my darling comrade, my dear darling brother, for so I will call you, and
      wish you to call me the same.<sup><a href="#nyp.00180_n100" id="r11">11</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00180_n3">1. This, apparently the
      first extant letter Whitman addressed to a soldier, is a revealing—and in many
      respects a pathetic—document. For Whitman was destined to write many others like
      it, and with the same results. Always Whitman was both an anxious father-figure
      and an ardent comrade desirous of establishing permanent ties with soldiers whom
      he had known and nursed in Washington hospitals. Like some of the others, Sawyer
      was evidently perplexed, possibly frightened, by Whitman's extravagant
      protestations of enduring friendship. The reply to Whitman's letter, dated April
      26, though it is signed "Thos. B. Sawyer," is not in Sawyer's holograph, as
      Whitman noted in a letter on . The
      author of the letter addressed Whitman as "Dear Brother," and continued: "I
      fully reciprocate your friendship as expressed in your letter and it will afford
      me great pleasure to meet you after the war will have terminated or sooner if
      circumstances will permit." However, on April 12, 1863, Sawyer himself had
      written to Brown: "I want you to give my love to Walter Whitman and tell him I
      am very sorry that I could not live up to my Prommice because I came away so
      soon that it sliped my mind and I am very sorry for it, tell him that I shall
      write to him my self in a few days, give him my love and best wishes for ever"
      (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library). Though
      Whitman wrote several times during 1863, Sawyer did not reply until : "Dear Brother, I hardly know what
      to say to you in this letter for it is my first one to you. . . . I hope you
      will forgive me and in the future I will do better and I hope we may meet again
      in this world."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00180_n4">2. The Army of the Potomac
      was preparing for the assault at Chancellorsville, Virginia.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00180_n5">3. Lewis Kirke Brown
      (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
      August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
      transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in
      February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on
      February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come
      and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on
      January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary
      (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was employed in the
      Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's letter from 
      . The following
      September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief
      of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until his retirement
      in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was prepared by Brown's
      family and is now held in the Library of Congress.)<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00180_n6">4. Hiram Sholes lay next to
      Brown in Armory Square Hospital, according to Sholes's letter to Walt Whitman on
      May 24, 1867 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection); see also "Letter from Walt
      Whitman to Hiram Sholes, May 30, 1867" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:331–332). Charles I. Glicksberg, ed., (<em>Walt Whitman and the Civil War</em> [Philadelphia: University of
      Pennsylvania Press, 1933], 155) records: "Hiram Scholis—bed 3—Ward E.—26th N.
      York—wants some pickles—a bottle of pickles.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00180_n7">5. John Mahay, private in
      Company A of the 101st New York, was wounded in the bladder at second Bull Run,
      August 29, 1862, and held on for fifteen months at Armory Square Hospital before
      dying in 1864. "Poor Mahay," Whitman writes in <em>Specimen
         Days</em>, "a mere boy in age, but old in misfortune" (Richard Maurice
      Bucke, ed., <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>, 10
      vols. (New York, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902). Whitman notes that Mahay, despite
      his pain, "was of good heart" and "was delighted with a stick of horehound candy
      I gave him" (4:46). Mahay is referred to as in poor health in letters from
      Whitman to Lewis K. Brown from 
       and 
      . See also
      Glicksberg, 149.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00180_n8">6. D. Willard Bliss
      (1825–1889) was a surgeon with the Third Michigan Infantry, and afterward
      in charge of Armory Square Hospital. See John Homer Bliss, <em>Genealogy of the Bliss Family in America, from about the year 1550 to
         1880</em> (Boston: John Homer Bliss, 1881), 545. He practiced medicine in
      Washington after the war; see "Letter from Walt Whitman to Hiram Sholes, May 30,
      1867" (<em>Correspondence</em>, 1:331–332). When a pension
      for Whitman was proposed in the House of Representatives in 1887, Dr. Bliss was
      quoted: "I am of opinion that no one person who assisted in the hospitals during
      the war accomplished so much good to the soldiers and for the Government as Mr.
      Whitman" (Thomas Donaldson, <em>Walt Whitman the Man</em> [New
      York: F. P. Harper, 1896], 169).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00180_n9">7. Admiral Samuel F. du Pont
      was severely defeated at Charleston, South Carolina, on April 7, 1863, in the
      worst naval loss of the Civil War.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00180_n10">8. Joseph Hooker
      (1814–1879) replaced Burnside as commanding general of the Army of the
      Potomac on January 26, 1863. He was defeated at Chancellorsville, Virginia, on
      May 2–4, 1863, and was succeeded by Meade on June 28, 1863, a few days
      before the battle of Gettysburg.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00180_n11">9. Edwin Haviland Miller's
      footnote from the <em>Correspondence</em> reads: "At this point
      Whitman deleted the following sentence: 'My old mother, in Brooklyn, New York,
      when she sees the troops marching away, or returning, always begins to cry'"
      (1:92–93). It is unclear from Miller's note whether this line was deleted
      from a draft document rather than from a (perhaps now lost) final copy of the
      letter, or whether Whitman had struck through this line so that it was still
      visible to Sawyer.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00180_n12">10. Miller's footnote from
      the <em>Correspondence</em> reads: "The following sentence,
      corrected several times, was omitted: 'What I have written is pretty strong
      talk, I suppose, but I mean exactly what I say'" (1:93). Again, it is unclear
      from Miller's note whether this line was omitted from a draft document rather
      than from a (perhaps now lost) final copy of the letter, or whether Whitman had
      struck through this line so that it was still visible to Sawyer.<a href="#r10">[back]
