   <p>I send you Jeff's<sup><a href="#n0710" id="r2">2</a></sup> letter,<sup><a href="#yal.00410_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> rec'd this morning, as it may
      possibly be later than any you have—I had a very good day yesterday, &amp; the best
      night last night I have had for a week—Doctor Drinkard has just been in—he says
      I am progressing the very best—In a day or two more I think I shall get out—or
      to the front door, at any rate—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear sister Lou,</p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter this morning—I will see how I feel, when I get better—about
      coming on—Don't think of such a thing as George's coming on here for me—You may
      be sure I shall be with you all, in as good health as every, yet—&amp; before very
      long—to-day I have been sadly pestered with visitors—every thing goes well with
      me, except the <em>slowness</em> of my improvement—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0710">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890), known as
      "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
      eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
      recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
      marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
      correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
      together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Matty) in 1873 and
      his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
      his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!" For
      more on Thomas Jefferson Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="yal.00410_n1">3. Jeff sent letters on February 7, 1873, to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and :
      there was no change in Martha's condition. Jeff informed his brother that he had
      learned about his illness in a newspaper.<a href="#r3">[back]
