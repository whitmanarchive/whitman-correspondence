      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I got both your letters last week, &amp; they were a relief to my mind—I want to hear
      whether sis got over swallowing the penny<sup><a href="#duk.00644_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      —don't forget to write about it—It has been cold &amp; disagreeable here, and another
      snow storm—but the sun shone all day yesterday—it keeps pretty backward here.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I went down to the Hospital Sunday—that young man Kephart<sup><a href="#duk.00644_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> was sitting up by the stove—he looked very pale &amp; thin, but is doing far better than
      I anticipated.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have written a letter to Han 
      —I have received a letter from Mrs. Price
      
      —they have most all of them been sick this winter—I see quite a good many notices
      of Dr. Ruggles' death in the papers—I enclose one printed in the paper here—taken
      from N. Y. Post—there is quite a long one in the Round Table, of March 16.<sup><a href="#duk.00644_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Every thing is exactly the same in the office, &amp; with me—Ashton<sup><a href="#duk.00644_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> has returned from Philadelphia—he tells me, confidentially, that he has decided to
      resign, early this summer—I am sorry to hear it—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope George will have good luck with the houses<sup><a href="#duk.00644_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—he must take things cool—don't fail to write to me how every thing goes—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, I believe that is all, for this time, dear mother.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

   <p id="duk.00644_n1">1. In a postscript to her
      letter of , Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman added: "last evening sis swallowed a penny, Jeff was very much alarmed
      about it but she is bright enough now."<a href="#r1">[back]

      Walt Whitman first wrote of Andrew J. Kephart in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Kephart
      was a soldier from Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, admitted from the 44th
      Regiment Infantry for bleeding at the lungs.<br><br>
      Whitman also wrote about Kephart's recovery in his  and 
      letters to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, and at the time of the poet's  letter, Kephart had "quite
      recovered."<a href="#r2">[back]

      The Brooklyn physician Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the
      Whitman family and became especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life,
      Ruggles lost interest in his practice and devoted himself to painting
      cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems."<br><br>
      Obituaries appeared in the New York <em>Evening Post</em>,
      March 11, 1867, and in the <em>Round Table</em>, 5 (1867),
      173. The author of the obituary in the New York <em>Tribune</em>, on March 12, 1867, lamented the fact that Ruggles had
      abandoned his profession to produce "Ruggles Gems": "The public gained
      nothing by the change, and we regret Dr. Ruggles' death, not because we have
      lost an artist, but because an excellent man and a worthy citizen has gone
      to his rest." Jeff and Martha attended the funeral, according to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's letter of .<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00644_n4">4. J. Hubley Ashton, the
      assistant Attorney General, actively interested himself in Walt Whitman's
      affairs, and obtained a position for the poet in his office after the Harlan
      fracas.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00644_n5">5. On , Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote that George expected
      to sell one of his houses but had to borrow $200 from Jeff. George, she wrote,
      "is well but begins to look quite old . . . ."<a href="#r5">[back]
