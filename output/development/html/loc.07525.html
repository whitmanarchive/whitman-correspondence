   <p>Yours came this mn'g—welcome as always—the photo has not come yet<sup><a href="#loc.07525_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Thankful &amp; even exulting that you are
      satisfied with <em>Nov: Boughs</em><sup><a href="#n3999" id="r3">3</a></sup> inward &amp; outward—It is
      upon the whole what I wanted &amp; planned, especially the "Backwards Road" piece
      (as O'C[onnor]<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r4">4</a></sup> says "that's what I deliberately said, &amp; I
      stand by it")—with that, &amp; Nov. B. &amp; probably all
      I have uttered, I have a considerate eye not at all to itself alone, but to its
      place with all the rest I have uttered, &amp; also to the future &amp;
      permanency—many sharp readers might not think so, but I <em>have</em>—Don't make
      much calculation of the complete Vol.<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r5">5</a></sup> It will be I hope a respectable looking piece
      of typography &amp;c. but nothing to brag of—but it <em>authenticates</em> probably
      better than any thing yet—there were several errors hitherto—not serious
      perhaps but errors—all these have of course been corrected, &amp; as I look
      over the pp. there appears not to be any typographical or any other blemish—(I
      am quite sure of that with L of G. throughout)—&amp; there will be five or six
      likenesses from life—&amp; autograph—Then this ensemble idea haunts me
      till I get it realized in an identity volume<sup><a href="#loc.07525_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am a little fearful ab't our dear O'C—eagerly look for word<sup><a href="#loc.07525_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup>—Matters so so with me—good bowel clearance
      to-day—word from my friend Linton<sup><a href="#loc.07525_n4" id="r8">8</a></sup> from Eng[land]
      to-day—he is well—Shall have some oysters for my dinner ab't
      4—made my breakfast of a big roast apple &amp; some Graham bread—the sun
      is out—

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07525_n2">2. According to his letter
      to Whitman of , Richard Maurice
      Bucke explained that he had his picture taken because John H. Johnston had
      requested "a likeness of myself to be used in an article on 'Walt and his
      friends.'" He sent the portrait with his letter to Whitman of .<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n3999">3. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n2002">4. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">5. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07525_n5">6. On , Whitman wrote to Bucke about the possibility of
      printing a select group of photos on uniform cards and arranging them in "a good
      handsome fitting envelope (? perhaps album)." At this time he even wrote up
      instructions to the printer specifying a run of 200 copies with gilt labeling
      and the title <em>Pictures from life of WW.</em> The project, like
      many others in Whitman's final years, was never completed (though a smaller
      edition of six portraits in a ribbon-tied envelope did appear in 1889).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="loc.07525_n3">7.  On , O'Connor wrote: "My eye is now
      under battery treatment (assault-and-battery treatment, you would think to look
      at it!)."<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="loc.07525_n4">8. Whitman is referring to a
      letter he received from the wood-engraver William J. Linton on . See also Whitman's , letter to Linton.<a href="#r8">[back]
