   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Your Letters &amp; papers came early at hand. But I did not know that you had been
      sick until I received your Letter; But I hope you are improving, and will finally
      get all right again.
   </p>
   
   <p>I left New York in Oct. 1868 and me and my Brother started [illegible]
      [
      <span class="unclear">separated?</span>]
       and I
      commenced to <u>Paddle my own Canoe</u>. I have A small route And
      keep A <u>Dep't.</u> And am making A fortune very Slow indeed, so
      slow—that I shall never get rich; 
      <p>sent p. card [illegible] April [illegible]</p>
       Business is [illegible] present [illegible]
      opposition [
      <span class="unclear">in the milk?</span>]
      
      trade and A great reduction in the price from 10 to 6 [
      <span class="unclear"><u>dls</u>?</span>]
       per quart. While
      the wholesale prices remain about the same
   </p>
   
   <p>You speak about your old friends in New York. Since I left there I have seen But few
      of the old Drivers, Henry Taylor alias (Sap Back), William Baun alias ([
      <span class="unclear">Baulky Bill?</span>]
      ,) and old [
      <span class="unclear">Jnop Rier?</span>]
      
      is the only one that have Been over to see me. Taylor was over last week [illegible] And lives at [illegible] the [
      <span class="unclear">war?</span>]
       cleared out A good many of the old veteran drivers, And now I
      hear they have got the [illegible]Boxes [
      <span class="unclear">for?</span>]
       all the [
      <span class="unclear">Stages?</span>]
       which will drop off A
      few 
      [
      <span class="unclear">things in general, And
         ?</span>]
      [illegible] has never seen A sick day So far. And all
      the rest of us are in [illegible] usual good Health. I
      should very much like to come and see you But my time is [
      <span class="unclear">pretty much?</span>]
       Occupied. But should very much like 
      you come
      
       and see me at any time you feel able.
   </p>
   
   <p>Enclosed you will find a card which my friends say resembles your Honorable Servant
      Very Much
