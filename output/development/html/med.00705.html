   <p>I have this afternoon received, read, and remailed to you galleys 37 to 45
      inclusive.<sup><a href="#med.00705_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I open and read these parcels of proof in
      fear and trembling (you must go as easy as you can, you are the terrible surgeon
      with the knife &amp; saw and I am the patient). You left out my remarks on "Children
      of Adam",<sup><a href="#med.00705_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I believe they were good but I
      acquiesce—your additions are excellent as they have
      been all through. I shall not feel half comfortable 
      untill
      
       I have had the proof of the rest of 
      p
      
       ii and have seen how much of me will be left. Poor O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r3">3</a></sup> too, he had to submit to the fatal shears<sup><a href="#med.00705_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—but you are going to make a book of it (if that be
      possible) so go ahead if we do flinch. But still, for the Lord's sake, spare my ch
      iii pt ii as much as possible. I want you, please (if I am not speaking 
      to
      
       late) 
      
      to save the M.S. and send it all to me when you are done with it. I
      shall be glad to have plate proofs as fast as made, if I see any thing in them that
      needs correcting will notify you otherwise will just put them by—I suppose you
      do not want them returned? It is still <u>winter</u> here, lots
      of snow, good sleighing,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
