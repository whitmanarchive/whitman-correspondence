   <p>It is a cloudy dark wet day—raining hard outside as I sit here by the
      window—am feeling pretty well—have just had my dinner, raw oysters &amp;
      a slice of boiled ham—enjoyed the meal—Get lots of invitations,
      applications &amp;c. every week—(O what lots of letters for
      autographs)—frequent visitors—sometimes an angel unawares—invites
      to swell dinners (or societies &amp;c) invariably declined—Am idle &amp;
      monotonous enough in my weeks &amp; life here—but upon the whole am mighty
      thankful it is no worse—my buying this shanty &amp; settling down here on
      ½ or ¼ pay, &amp; getting Mrs. D[avis]<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r1">1</a></sup> to cook for me, <em>might</em> have been bettered by my disposing <em>some other way</em>—but I am satisfied it is all as well as it

   <p>—Morse<sup><a href="#duk.00863_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> is still out in Indiana with a probability of remaining—at least

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy and Richard
      Maurice Bucke were two of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Kennedy
      (1850–1929) first met Whitman while on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> in 1880. He became a fierce defender of Whitman
      and would go on to write a book-length study of the poet. For more about
      Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian physician,
      was Whitman's first biographer, and would later become one of his medical
      advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of Bucke and
      Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n6113">1. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_92.html">Davis, Mary Oakes (1837 or 1838–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="loc.07637_n2">2. Undoubtedly Whitman was
      informing Kennedy that he contemplated no change in his living arrangements, and
      that the proceeds from the Cottage Fund were to be used (or not used) as he saw
      fit. Although Whitman's friend was loath to offer any public criticism, some of
      the contributors were evidently annoyed that no accounting was made by the poet.
      Hamlin Garland, in 1889, asked Horace Traubel "what had become of the cottage
      money." Whitman retorted quickly: "It is a question not again to be reopened"
      (Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.92.html"> Monday, July 8, 1889</a>).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00863_n3">3. Sidney H. Morse was a
      self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to 1872,
      editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden many
      times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier bust by
      Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan, <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art, 1850–1920</em>
      (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2006), 57–84; and

         Biography</em> (New York: Vintage Books, 1996), 546–590.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">4. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4133">5. In late 1887, James Gordon Bennett,
      Jr., editor of the <em>New York Herald</em>, invited Whitman to
      contribute a series of poems and prose pieces for the paper. From December 1887
      through August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems appeared.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02189_n1">6. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="loc.07637_n1">7. In the upper margin of the
