      <br></br><br></br>Dear Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I received your note of 30 Novr,<sup><a href="#loc.03610_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; have been
      intending to write for some little while past. 
   </p>
   
   <p> You &amp; I have both suffered a loss in the death of that admirable woman Mrs
      Gilchrist<sup><a href="#loc.02182_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>—a strong warm nature, full of strong
      sympathetic sense &amp; frank cordiality. I look round the circle of my acquaintance
      for her equal. Much might be said on such a topic: but often a little is as good as
      much. 
   </p>
   
   <p> The subscription<sup><a href="#loc.02186_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> has continued  going on, in much the same course
      as previously, as you will see from the enclosed list. In the Athenaeum (&amp; I
      believe Academy) of 2 Jany a paragraph was put in, to serve as a reminder to any
      well-wishers: perhaps it may be expected that a few will respond, &amp; that we may
      then regard our little movement as wound up. I shall always esteem it a privilege
      to
      have borne my small share in testifying the respect &amp; gratitude to you 
      wh.
      
       are due to you (I might say) from all open-minded men &amp; women in the
      world—&amp; from the shut-minded too, for the matter of that. 
   </p>
   
   <p> My wife &amp; children are  away at Ventnor (Isle of Wight), as the London winter threatened
      to be too much for my wife's delicate chest. I expect to join them within the next
      few days, staying away some 3 weeks or so. As I may be a little hurried the last
      remaining days, it is possible that I may not just now pay in the ￡33.16.6.
      shown in the enclosed list—assuming as I do that this point 
      wd
      
       not be regarded as material. However, the utmost likely delay 
      wd
      
       not be <u>long</u>.
      
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours always truly,
      <br></br>W. M. Rossetti
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I have seen 3 or 4 times Mr. 
      Chas
      
       Aldrich, of Webster City, Iowa:<sup><a href="#loc.03610_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> he told
       us of
      his interview with you shortly before he crossed the Atlantic. We liked him,
      &amp; 
      wd
      
       gladly have seen more of him: but this apparently will not be, for he
      must now be just about to sail back from Liverpool to New York.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      presenting a free-will offering to the American poet Walt Whitman. The poet is
      in his sixty-seventh year, and has since his enforced retirement some years ago
      from official work in Washington, owing to an attack of paralysis, maintained
      himself precariously by the sale of his works in poetry and prose, and by
      occasional contributions to magazines." <a href="#r4">[back]
