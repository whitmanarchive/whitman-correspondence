      <br></br><br></br>Dear W. W.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>With yr welcome card came to-night a letter fr. Gardner of Paisley,<sup><a href="#n4318" id="r1">1</a></sup> accepting my MS. "Walt Whitman the Poet of Humanity." He is
      going to pub. in 2 vols. Is evidently enthusiastic. The poltroon, however,(!) wants
      me to cut
      out the censor's list of objectionable passages. I don't really know that they are
      essential,—guess
      I'd better let him. I suppose his idea is that people will buy L. of G. more if they
      are not given the passages in question in my book. He bites hard—says "it wd
      be a vast pity if the book were to fall through," owing to my obstinacy I suppose
      he
      means. I shall satisfy him. Have written him to leave those out.
   </p>
   
   <p>I too have a terrific cold in head. Am <u>deaf</u> in one ear
      temporarily, through sitting by open window (necessarily) where I work. But it is
      nothing. Wax in ear only.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are having house painted. Do hope you will get over that cold, dear Walt. Thank
      you for the news fr. O'C.<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> the Transcripts<sup><a href="#loc.02996_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> are so thin I am ashamed to send 'em half the time. But it
      is little trouble, &amp; you can throw them on the floor when you get sick of em. Remembrances
      to
      Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp;c. It does one good to think of Dr. Bucke.<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      <u>One</u> well man at least, ha, ha, thank God for 'em those hearty
      "fellers." I take great delight in dogs for same reason.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br> William Sloane Kennedy,
      biographer, editor, and critic, was one of Whitman's most devoted friends and
      admirers. Kennedy first met Whitman in Philadelphia in 1880 while working on the
      staff of the <em>American</em>. He soon became a frequent
      correspondent and visitor to Whitman's Camden, New Jersey, home, a constant
      contributor of small gifts, and the author of several essays and newspaper
      articles in praise of Whitman. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine
      Reagan,"<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>"" Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4318">1. Alexander Gardner (1821–1882)
      of Paisley, Scotland, was a publisher who reissued a number of books by and
      about Whitman; he ultimately published William Sloane Kennedy's <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> in 1896 after a long and
      contentious battle with Kennedy over editing the book. Gardner published and
      co-edited the <em>Scottish Review</em> from 1882 to 1886.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02996_n1">3. Kennedy and others published
      a number of short pieces on Whitman in the <em>Boston Evening
         Transcript</em> in 1888, and Kennedy sent copies to Whitman.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
