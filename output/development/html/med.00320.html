      <br></br><br></br>Friend W. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have taken your proposition into consideration.</p>  
   
   <p>There is a lion in the way—$</p>
   
   <p>I could easily publish a small Book, but the one you propose—to stereotype, advertise
      and push it—implies an expenditure that may be beyond my means. But if I can get credit,
      I may try. Whether I will or no depends somewhat on the printer's notions as to whether
      the book would sell.
   </p>
   
   <p>Suppose you finish it and send it on: if I can't publish it, I will see if some other
      person won't.
   </p>
   
   <p>This is the best I can safely promise you. If I can get one or two jobbers to read
      and like it, and they will make an advance order, or give a favorable trade opinion,
      the way is clear.
   </p>
   
   <p>What say?</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Whitman wrote to James
      Redpath on , with a detailed
      proposal for a book he proposed to call <em>Memoranda of a
         Year</em>. Redpath (1833–1891) was the author of <em>The
         Public Life of Capt. John Brown</em> (Boston: Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a
      correspondent for the <em>New York Tribune</em> during the war,
      the originator of the "Lyceum" lectures, and editor of the <em>North American Review</em> in 1886. He met Whitman in Boston in 1860
      (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #90) and remained an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, ed. Sculley Bradley (New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914), 3:459–461. He concluded his first letter
      to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A
      conquering Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric
      jawp." See also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of
         James Redpath and the Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse
      &amp; Hopkins, 1926).
