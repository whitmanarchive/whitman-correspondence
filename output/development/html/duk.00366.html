      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I arrived here and joined the Regiment about ten days ago and was placed in command
      of this Prison.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am very well, indeed but have plenty to do as I have about 300 Prisoners (mostly
      thieves, Bounty jumpers and Deserters) to look after. I have 100 of the men of our
      Regt. and 5 Officers here with me guarding the Prisoners.
   </p>
   
   <p>There is about 20 Rebel officers here (Paroled Prisoners) but they are used very different
      from what we were, when we were in Rebeldom.
   </p>
   
   <p>I saw Walt when I came through Washington, and I hear he was over to see me yesterday
      but did not find me. Well Mammy the war seems to be over, and I think the most of
      us will soon be sent home. It is now getting late (after Eleven O clock at night) and as I feel rather tired
      I will go through the Prison and see that all is right and then turn in. I sleep here
      in the building (I have a very good room) and take my meals at a Boarding house &nbsp;I
      pay 6 dollars per week for grub but dont live any of the best.
   </p>

      Good night to all

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00366_n100">1. Not long after he had
      arrived at Annapolis, George Whitman was granted a thirty-day furlough. He
      reached his mother's home in Brooklyn on March 5, 1865, and although his leave
      was to expire on April 4, he reluctantly applied for an extension for reasons of
      health. In support of his request, the Whitman family physician, Edward Ruggles,
      wrote: "I have carefully &amp; several times examined this Officer, and find
      that he has Rheumatism, with swelling &amp; weakness of legs, &amp; Debility . .
      ." (Military Record; see Jerome M. Loving's ). George Whitman reported for military duty about April
      24 and was assigned command of a military prison in Alexandria, Virginia.<a href="#r1">[back]
