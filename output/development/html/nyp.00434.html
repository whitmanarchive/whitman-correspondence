      <br></br><br></br>Dear Harry
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I keep about the same in health—am &amp; have been very busy with the printing
      of my book, it goes on all right &amp; suits me—246 pages are up (&amp; mostly
      electrotyped)<sup><a href="#nyp.00434_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>That was a sudden and dreadful piece of news, the death of Beatrice Gilchrist<sup><a href="#nyp.00434_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—your mother's letter informing me was sent on here
      from Camden P O—Harry, please tell her I 
      rec'd
      
       it, &amp; thank her for sending me word—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Harry, I do not know the Secretary of the Navy or Treasury either<sup><a href="#nyp.00434_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—do you still think of getting in one of the coast
      life-saving stations? I will write to any one you wish me to, for that
      purpose—fix on some particular person, who has the appointment, if you decide
      to try for it—I will do any thing I can for you—(By the by, tell Van I
      went twice to see a man in Camden, a boss plumber, three months ago—he said he
      could not take on any boy just then, but he probably would want one, &amp; would
      send me word)—I am having good times here—have a good room &amp;
      boarding house, the landlady<sup><a href="#nyp.00434_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> is first rate &amp; kind
      [to] me, (as often happens I find my best friends among the women)—then I have
      a friend here, a man of leisure, who has a good horse &amp; phaeton, takes me out
      riding afternoons or fine evenings<sup><a href="#nyp.00434_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—So you see I am
      putting in <em>good</em> papers—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, dear boy, how does it go with you? I hope all right—I 
      rec'd
      
       your letter here—tell Mont if he feels disposed to write to me, (if
      he is in the store &amp; has a spare hour) I will answer it—if he does, I want
      him to tell me all the news—(I get the <em>
         Phil:
         
          Ledger</em>, a friend in the office there sends it to me)<sup><a href="#nyp.00434_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—Hot, hot as the devil here three days the past
      week—but I don't seem to melt yet—pleasant &amp; cool now—I shall
      stay here three weeks yet—if you write direct same address (care J R Osgood
      &amp; Co: 211 Tremont Street Boston)—Love to you, Harry boy, &amp; keep a good
      heart—you know the verse of the old song
   </p>
   <span class="indent">"A light heart &amp; thin pair of breeches</span><br>
   <span class="indent">Goes through the world my brave
      boys"</span><br>
   
   
   <p>Well the office has just sent me a fresh batch of proofs &amp; I must go to work
      &amp; tackle them—
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>W W
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      <em>Later</em>—half an hour—I was keeping this, all
      enveloped &amp;c. to take to the box when yours dated Sept: 
      3d
      
       has just come—so I open it to add a line—yes, I got the
      letter of over two weeks since (as above)—dear boy, I feel sorry about the
      ailing—write me about it all, soon as you get this—I send the papers
      you request, same mail with this<sup><a href="#nyp.00434_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—Harry boy, if
      you want a little money write me &amp; I will supply you—(Son, why did you
      send your letter to Camden?)
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer"><br></br>Always your old Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>hope you will get this before Sunday—</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00434_n1">1. The entry in Whitman's
      Commonplace Book for this date reads: "have just read proof to page 245 of the
      book" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00434_n2">2. In his Commonplace Book
      Whitman commented: "some gloomy news—sad, sad—the death of Beatrice
      Gilchrist—as accomplished and noble a young woman as I ever knew." Yet he
      did not write to the mother until . On
       Anne Gilchrist wrote to Whitman:
      "Herby wrote to Mrs. Stafford first—thinking that so the shock would come
      less abruptly to you."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00434_n3">3. See the letter from
      Whitman to Harry Stafford of .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00434_n4">4. Mrs. Moffitt.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00434_n5">5. Probably one of his new
      Boston friends mentioned in Whitman's Commonplace Book: Colonel Frank E. Howe,
      Captain Milton Haxtun, or Ed Dallin.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00434_n6">6. Probably a reference to
      Richard E. Labar, who, according to an entry in Whitman's Commonplace Book, was
      associated with the Philadelphia <em>Public Ledger</em>. Whitman
      wrote (lost) to Labar on August 21. Upon his return to Camden, on November 10,
      he made a "visit through the <em>Ledger</em> office with Dick
      Labar" (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00434_n7">7. According to Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, Whitman sent copies of <em>The Long
         Islander</em> (see the letter from Whitman to John Burroughs of ), the Boston <em>Daily
         Globe</em> (see the letter from Whitman to Louisa Orr Whitman of ), and his article "City Notes in
      August," which had appeared in the New York <em>Tribune</em> on
      August 15. For the last-named article, included in abridged form in <em>Specimen Days</em> (ed. Floyd Stovall [New York: New York
      University Press, 1963], 273–276, 354–355), he received
      $10.<a href="#r7">[back]
