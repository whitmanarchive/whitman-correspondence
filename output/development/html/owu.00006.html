   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you think strange that I hav'nt written you before but I wanted to get
      some nice paper to send a few lines to Mrs O Conner.<sup><a href="#duk.00436_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      but I will enclose a few lines to her in this letter
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The children were delighted to have me home again and Jeff<sup><a href="#n4995" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      too seemed to think I was quite an addition to the family. I am glad I went to
      Brooklyn it has improved me much. but was sorry to find Mammy so lame some days
      she is very bad. I told Jeff and the children that you are coming 
       to St Louis before
      long. they are very much delighted and there is another thing Walt Mammy<sup><a href="#n0705" id="r3">3</a></sup> promised me that she would come with you so you see we wont
      let you off with a promise but you <u>must really
         come</u></p>
   
   
   <p>Jeff is well he misses Davis very much but the work goes on well we have
      delightful weather here everything looks like Spring I am glad I put off my
      visit to Washington Jeff thinks it best too that I did not go and I still can
      have it in anticipation.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The children send their love and they want you to write to them as I want to
      write to Mother I will say good night from your sister

   <p>Walt please say to Mrs O Conner that I am truly sorry that I could not accept her
      very kind invitation to visit her at Washington.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>on account of the weather being so changeable this time of year I thought it
      would be better to return to St Louis
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The accomodation would have been ample and I should have enjoyed a visit with Mrs
      O Conner very much indeed
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Please convey to them my love and express to them my hearty thanks for their
      kindness—also say to Mrs O C and family that we should very much enjoy having
      them visit us in St Louis if they could accomplish it

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Martha Mitchell Whitman (d. 1873) known as "Mattie,"
      was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and
      Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
      the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat
      ailment that would lead to her death in 1873.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00436_n3">1. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor
      was the wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Walt Whitman's
      staunchest defenders. Walt may have mentioned a potential visit by Nelly and her
      daughter during his May visit to Brooklyn, though whether a visit came near this
      time is not known from his or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters. Walt Whitman
      dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington years, and he spoke
      often in his letters of their daughter Jean (called "Jenny" or "Jeannie").
      Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break off their friendship in late
      1872 over a disagreement about Reconstruction policies and the role of
      emancipated slaves, Nelly would remain friendly with Whitman. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4995">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0705">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
