   </p>
   
   
   <p>I enclose the money for Walter Godey. Please go down &amp; see how things are going on—&amp;
      pay him. Please write me at once, as I shall want to hear if the money comes safe.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Don't be alarmed—but I am worse to-day—having a bad spell—a succession of those <em>blurs</em> I used to complain of, only far more intense 
      &amp; persistent—it is now ½ past 3, &amp; I have had a succession of them all day—still I
      am not dismayed—still think I shall get well—We are moving into the new house to-day.<sup><a href="#prc.00029_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
