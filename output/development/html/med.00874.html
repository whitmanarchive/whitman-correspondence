   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="med.00874_n4">6. The Johnstown flood. In
      <em>The Commonplace-Book</em> Whitman wrote on June 1, 1889:
      "The most pervading &amp; dreadful news this m'ng is of the strange cataclysm at
      Johnstown &amp; adjoining Cambria County, Penn: by wh' many thousands of people
      are overwhelm'd, kill'd by drowning in water, burnt by fire, &amp;c:
      &amp;c:—all our hearts, the papers &amp; the public interest, are fill'd
      with it—the most signal &amp; wide-spread horror of the kind ever known in
      this country—curious that at this very hour, we were having the dinner
      festivities &amp;c—unaware." Browning, now the Philadelphia representative
      of the New York <em>World</em>, was instructed by Julius Chambers
      to ask the poet for "a threnody on the Johnstown dead," which became "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00052.html">A
         Voice from Death</a>" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
