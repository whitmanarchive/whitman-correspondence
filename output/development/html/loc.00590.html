      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I feel just like writing to you.  In fact I have often &amp; often yearned to write you,
      Even if I could not visit you.  But I have gone through every thing since last I saw
      your glorious self in bodily form.  I together with my dear wife have had lots of
      hard experiences—ill health, sickness of children and my own hard labor to keep soul
      and body together.  Then the "what might have been" cling to me and like a premature
      <em>old</em> man I dwell with bitterness upon the past.  "Leaves of Grass" why oh! why had we
      to <em>leave</em> thee to the tender mercies of the ignorant, the unfeeling, the unpoetic, the vulgar<sup><a href="#loc.00590_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>!  When I look at the copy of the "Leaves" on our parlor table I internally cry Oh
      Walt.  Then I <em>swear</em> I'll write You, and there—I am called away to do some other thing—of labor &amp; leave
      pleasure, ~  Since the failure of T&amp;E, I was out of business five months &amp; then obtained a clerkship in the
      Boston Post Office where I have worked very hard, and suffered much mentally incapacitating
      me for writing reading or thinking.  So I have lived only to work, eat, sleep, &amp;c.
      — I now work all night 11 to 7 &amp; sleep daytimes.  I have been enjoying a vacation
      which only the want of money prevented my spending in York, as tonight is my last
      night at home.  I improve the chance to write you, for who knows when I may get another
      to talk, to you or with you?  ~  You doubtless have wondered why I have not written
      you but I have thought enough about you.  How I <em>do</em> wish I could meet you, and <em>feel</em> your big magnetism by touching your grasping hand.
   </p>
   
   <p>We moved from Forest Hill to Boston where we occupied a big brick house till we had
      to leave because of the children's health. We now have a cozy house in Cambridgeport with yard
      room and plenty of fine air.
   </p>
   
   <p>T&amp;E affairs remain at a stand.  The assignees have eaten up all the assets as near
      as I can learn. They sold all the stock to Wentworth taking his notes which <em>are not paid</em>.  He fiddles along so I hear<sup><a href="#loc.00590_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>.  As I am much confined at the post office or at home asleep or exhausted, I find
      but little opportunity to know all that transpires.  I heard that some friend of yours
      tried to buy "Leaves of Grass" plates for $200 &amp; Wentworth refused to sell.  Since
      which I have heard that he regretted his refusal and was anxious to sell.  Wentworth
      has been at the bottom of all our troubles since failure by embittering the creditors
      against us so that they would not settle with us or allow us to compromise &amp; continue
      in business.  But that is now passed. T&amp;E sign boards at still kept at the old stand
      to tell me of "what might have been."  But even if we had you on we would have had
      a severe struggle through this bloody war to sustain our business<sup><a href="#loc.00590_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>.  ~  Eldridge is in Washington as clerk to an army Paymaster.  He does not want to
      return to Boston to live.  I wish I could get out of it.  I lead a miserable life
      now I assure you, save that which I enjoy in my home.  I have uncongenial companions
      to work with in the office, who though externally good, are internally nobodies, with
      minds that have fed on husks, they present but poor incentives to one who would enjoy
      true refinement of soul, or <em>purity</em> of thought, or thought downright earnest sturdy <em>thought</em> of any kind.  Poor fellows!  They have hard work &amp; disagreeable &amp; I must not blame
      them, for I believe it is the nature of the employment that stultifies.  For I think
      that I myself have got "slunk," and have not very exalted ambitions now, although
      please understand, your old "fanatic" of the concern of T&amp;E is by no means crushed.  He only wants his time to <em>rise</em>.  The Post master is a good friend to me so I must not complain for without my clerkship,
      God only knows how I could have supported the dear ones at home.  My friends told
      me my chance for a berth in the P.O. was one in a thousand.  I told them I would take
      that chance.  I set to work &amp; got the position.  "Faint heart never won fair lady"
      &amp; O. here I am in Government service &amp; not liable to military draft.  —But I would
      volunteer if I had no wife &amp; babies.  My heart is in the war &amp; I ache to do something.
      But I can't.  I work hard &amp; have to eat &amp; sleep to recuperate &amp; even then have no
      brain left for use in social converse with old friends.  As this is sort of half of
      himself letter you won't expect much of a composition.  I wanted to write to you.
      I care not to say much, nor go into the war that prolific theme of blood <em>and</em> blunders nor give you news, nor anything else.  I only wanted to tell you I "still
      live" &amp; hope you do too so that you can write me a return note when you get into the
      mood.
      
      Saturday Sept 6/62
      
      Here now is a sample of my procrastination.  To day, Saturday &amp; this letter unfinished.
      Never mind.  If you can please write me.  Is there any news.  Hows Bohemia and its
      Queen the charming Ada?<sup><a href="#loc.00590_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> She talks with us every week in the Leader in articles that vivify and I <em>love</em> to read.  By the bye Mrs. Thayer hopes to visit
