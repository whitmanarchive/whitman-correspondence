   <p>I sent thanks by Mr. Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r1">1</a></sup> in my letter to him for the
      photograph of William,<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; also for the pictures of the
      "laughing Philosopher," &amp; the note enclosed. I have a photog. like it &amp; will
      send it, with another, the Rossiter Johnson &amp; let him select. I return yours. Send me a
      postal card that I may know if you get it safely. I have been ill since I came here
      (to Nantucket) but am better now. I am with a widow lady friend for a short time,
      but soon expect to be near Boston, &amp; so please send to the address at the head
      of this letter. Glad that you had such a pleasant visit with Sir Edwin Arnold. You
      know he married the daughter of our dear friend William Henry Channing,<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup> who used to be in Washington during the war.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I did receive Liberty with Horace Traubel's article &amp; wrote him at once thanking
      him for it. It is <u>noble</u> and <u>generous</u> &amp; touched me most deeply. I have written to Tucker<sup><a href="#n4290" id="r4">4</a></sup> asking him to save <u>six</u> copies for me
      till I go to Boston, &amp; can call or send for them. I hope Mr. Traubel got my letter.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4267">1. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00945_n5">3. William F. Channing
      (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
      Whitman stayed at his home in October, 1868.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n4290">4. Benjamin Ricketson Tucker
      (1854–1939) was an American activist and editor of the anarchist
      periodical <em>Liberty</em>, which ran from 1881 to 1908.<a href="#r4">[back]
