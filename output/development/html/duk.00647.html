      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Jeff,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I heard by William O'Connor of the St. Louis proposition<sup><a href="#duk.00647_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—&amp; as far as I could judge by his
      account—&amp; since by your letter &amp; Mother's—it seems to me best
      to accept the offer, &amp; go, by all means—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is a great work—a noble position—&amp; will give you a good big field.</p>
   
   
   <p>Jeff, I wish to hear about the family arrangements—whether Mother &amp; Martha
      &amp;c are going to stay there this summer, or not—(I hope they are.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing special with me, to write about. In the office, all goes on as
      usual. I still board at 472 M st. Love to Mat &amp; the little girls. Remember me to
      Mr. Lane<sup><a href="#duk.00647_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; Davis<sup><a href="#duk.00647_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—So good bye for this
      time, Jeffy, dear brother. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."
