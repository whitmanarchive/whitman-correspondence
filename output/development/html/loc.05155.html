      Sept: 5. 1890
      
      
      <br></br><br></br>My dear Master
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I am sincerely obliged to you for your letter of August 19.<sup><a href="#loc.05155_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> It is a great relief to me to know so clearly &amp; 
      precisely what you feel about the question I raised. Your phrases "gratuitous &amp; quite
      at the time undreamed &amp; 
      unrecked possibility of morbid inferences—which are disavowed by me &amp; seem damnable,"
      set the matter as 
      straight as can be, base this doctrine of Calamus upon a foundation of granite.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I am not surprised; for this indeed is what I understood to be your meaning, since
      I have studied Leaves of Grass in the 
      right way—interpreting each part by reference to the whole &amp; in the spirit of the
      whole. The result of this study
      was that the "adhesiveness" of comradeship had no interblending with the "amativemess"
      of sexual love.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Yet you must not think that the "morbid inferences," which to you "seem damnable,"
      are quite "gratuitous" or outside of the range of possibility.
      Frankly speaking, the emotional language of Calamus is such as hitherto has not been
      used in the modern world about the relation between friends.
      For a student of ancient literature it presents a singular analogue to the early Greek
      enthusiasm of comradeship in arms—as that appeared among the Dorian tribes, &amp; made
      a chivalry for prehistoric Hellas. And you know what singluar
      anomalies were connected with this lofty sentiment in the historic period of Greek
      development
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Again, you cannot be ignorant that a certain percentage (small but appreciable) of
      male beings are always born into the world, 
      whose sexual instincts are what the Germans call "inverted". During the last 25 years
      much attention, in France, Germany, Austria and Italy, 
      has been directed to the psychology and pathology of these abnormal persons. 
      In 1889 the Penal Code of Italy was altered by the erasion of their eccentricities
      from the list of crimes.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Looking then to the lessons of the past in ancient Greece, where a heroic chivalry
      of comradeship grew intertwined with moral abominations 
      (I speak as a modern man), &amp; also to the Contemporary problem offered by the class
      of persons I have mentioned—who will certainly have 
      somehow to be dealt with in the light of science, since the eyes of science have been
      drawn towards them: looking, I say, to both these things, it became of the utmost
      importance to know for certain what you thought about those "morbid inferences". 
      For you have announced clearly that a great spiritual factor lies latent in Comradeship,
      ready to leap forth 
      and to take a prominent part in the energy of the human race. It is, I repeat, essential
      that the interpreters of your prophecy should be able to speak authoritatively
      and decisively about their Master's <u>Stimmung</u>, his radical instinct with regard to the emotional and moral quality of the comradeship
      he announces.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I am sorry to have annoyed you with this discussion. But you will see, I hope now,
      that it was not wholly unnecessary or unprofitable.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      With the explanation you have placed in my hands, in which you give me liberty to
      use, I can speak with no uncertain voice, 
      &amp; with no dread lest the enemy should blaspheme.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      The conclusion reached is, to my mind, in every way satisfactory. I am so profoundly
      convinced that you are right in all you say about the great good
      which is to be expected from Comradeship as you conceive it, &amp; as alone it can be
      a salutary
      human bond, that the power of repudiating those "morbid inferences" authoritatively—should
      they ever be made seriously or uttered openly,
      either by your detractors or by the partizans of some vicious crankiness—sets me quite
      at ease as to my own course.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I will tell my bookseller in London to send you a copy of the "Contemporary" in which
      there is an essay by me on the
      "Dantesque and Platonic Ideals of Love." You will see something there about the Dorian
      Chivalry of Comradeship to wh. I have alluded
      in this letter. It seems to me, I confess, still doubtful whether (human nature being
      what it is) we can expect wholly to eliminate some
      sensual alloy from any emotions which are raised to a very high pitch of passionate
      intensity. But the moralizing of the emotions must be left
      to social feeling and opinion in general, and ultimately to the individual conscience.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I am greatly interested in your "Rejoinder" (wh. by the way has been reprinted in
      the PMG). Anything you say about the inception
      and performance of your great life-work has value.—I have been ill; six days in bed
      with high fever, a lung-inflammation serious to me;
      only just up again for a few hours. 
      
   </p>

      Ever yours with deep gratitude and true affection.
      <br></br>John Addington Symonds.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
