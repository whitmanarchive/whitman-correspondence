   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00628_n4">1. The date of this letter is
      uncertain, but the most probable date is April 5, 1873. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's letter acknowledges one from Walt Whitman, probably his  letter, and Edwin Haviland Miller
      dated this letter April 5?, 1873 (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:208, n. 47; 2:370). Louisa responded to Walt that he "should certainly get a
      place for you and edd and me": the word "certainly" echoes Walt's remark on
      acquiring a house in Washington from his letter, that he "<em>shall certainly do so</em>." Walt had also mentioned a house in his  letter to Louisa. Louisa's statement
      on the house is consistent also with the timing of George Washington Whitman's
      new house on 431 Stevens Street: in this letter, she wrote that "george has
      commenced his house the cellar is being dug." A week later she reported that
      George's "house is begun the cellar dug and the foundation laid" (see her  letter to Walt). Therefore, April 5,
      1873 is the most probable date for this letter. However, Louisa also wrote, "i
      told you saturday i would give you an account of our affairs," a statement that
      cannot be reconciled with Louisa's 
      (Saturday) letter to Walt, which has no such promise. Despite that
      inconsistency, Louisa's discussion of the prospective house that they could
      share in Washington echoes Walt's April 4, 1873 letter, and her account of
      George's progress on his new Camden house is in accord with her April 8 letter
      to Walt.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n11">2. Helen Price was the
      daughter of Abby and Edmund Price. Abby Price and her family, especially her
      daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman and his mother, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman. Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform
      movements. Price's husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and
      the couple had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in
      1852, at 2 years of age). In 1860, the Price family began to save Walt's
      letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman were included in Richard Maurice
      Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1883), and she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters to
      her mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n6">3. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00628_n15">4. The "aunt" who was engaged
      to assist Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, George Washington Whitman's wife, has not
      been identified but is probably named Elizabeth. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      described her daughter-in-law Louisa Orr's aunt as English and was not fond of
      the aunt's company. She is named "aunt Lib" and "aunt Libby" in Louisa's  and  letters to Walt.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]

      inverted on the first page.<br><br>
      George Washington Whitman was building a house on a corner lot at 431 Stevens
      Street in Camden, New Jersey (see Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975], 31). For an extended description of George's planned house, see

      the preceding word "or."<a href="#r7">[back]
