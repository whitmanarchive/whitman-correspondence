   <p>I think <em>Birds and Poets</em> not only much the best name for the book, but a first-rate good name, appropriate,
      original &amp; fresh, without being at all affected or strained. The piece you put 4th should then be <em>first</em>—should lead the book, giving it its title, &amp; having the name of the piece changed
      to "Birds and Poets"—which I think would be an improvement. The whole collection would
      be sufficiently homogeneous, (and it were a fault to be too much so)—You just want
      <em>a hint</em> for the name of a book—Only it must be in the spirit of the book—&amp; not too much so
      either. "<em>Nature and Genius" is too Emersony altogether</em>.<sup><a href="#nyp.00405_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p> I will think over the name of the piece devoted to me, &amp; will in a couple of days
      write you the result. May-be I can think of a better name. I have not rec'd the MS from Church.<sup><a href="#nyp.00405_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> You send on any thing—any MS—which I will cheerfully read &amp; will return with any
      suggestions that may occur to me—I keep pretty well for me—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00405_n1">1. This letter bears the
      address: John Burroughs | Esopus-on-Hudson | New York. It is postmarked: Camden
      | Jan | 24 | N.J.; New York | Jan | 25 | 8 AM.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00405_n2">2. Burroughs accepted
      Whitman's suggestion, and "Birds and Poets," which had appeared in <em>Scribner's Monthly</em> in 1873 (see Whitman's letter to Peter
      Doyle on ), became the
      first chapter in the book. For over a month Burroughs sent to Whitman the
      manuscript of this book for comment and correction; see Whitman's letters to
      John Burroughs on , , and . Whitman's emendations, particularly in the chapter
      devoted to himself, "The Flight of the Eagle," are discussed at length by Clara
      Barrus in <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston,
      New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931), 160–163.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00405_n3">3. This is possibly a
      reference to "Our Rural Divinity," which appeared in <em>The
         Galaxy</em>, 23 (January 1877) 43–51.<a href="#r3">[back]
