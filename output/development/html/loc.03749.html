      <br></br>Dear Walt.  
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I met Maurice Barrymore,<sup><a href="#n4189" id="r1">1</a></sup> the actor who was playing in "Held by the Enemy"<sup><a href="#loc.03749_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> at the
      Academy last week. He asked about you with the deepest interest, and said he would
      write to you during his present engagement in New York, where he now is—
   </p>
   
   <p>He is wonderfully bright &amp; entertaining and holds you in affectionate &amp;
      reverent memory. 
      The election of Harrison,<sup><a href="#n4269" id="r3">3</a></sup> toward which event I <u>worked</u> with all the <u>vim</u> in me, seems to put a little better lining on the edge
      of the <u>clouds</u> which, in spite of myself seem to have
      "encompassed me about" for the past two years. I can, at least, get my old place
      back again and may get something better. I am still writing for the <u>Times</u>.
   </p> 
   
   <p>Mrs Scovel bid me say that she wants to come &amp; see you. Dear
      Walt! My most pleasing recollections of Camden are associated with that old House
      in
      Arch St., the quiet
      Sunday dinners, and the blazing Hickory fire before which you used to [illegible]. Well: maybe they will all come again.
      With best wishes I am Affect'ly yours
   </p>

   <p> PS Maybe when as Bryant<sup><a href="#n6116" id="r4">4</a></sup> says "The May sun sheds an amber
      light, the new-leaved woods and lawns between,"<sup><a href="#loc.03749_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup>—maybe, we can drive down
      again to Gloucester and with the
      generous "Statesman" Thompson,<sup><a href="#n4126" id="r6">6</a></sup> partake of the toothsome shad, and the
      "wine divine from the
      Champagne county.  Walt: these <u>were</u> pleasant Hours.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Matlock Scovel began to
      practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War he was in the New Jersey
      legislature, and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned actively for Horace
      Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S. Treasury during Chester
      Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home
      for Sunday breakfast, as he did on December 2 and 9, 1877 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a description of
      these breakfasts, see <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed.
      William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel,
      see George R. Prowell's <em>The History of Camden County, New
         Jersey</em> (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4189">1. Maurice Barrymore (1849–1905)
      was the stage name of Herbert Arthur Chamberlayne Blythe who was born in India
      and later educated in England. He became a boxing champion before taking up
      acting; he emigrated to the United States and debuted in Augustin Daly's play
      <em>Under the Gaslight.</em> He married the actress Georgiana
      Drew, and he starred in Broadway productions and headlined in Vaudeville.
      Barrymore is the great-grandfather of actress Drew Barrymore. For more on
      Barrymore's biography, see James Kotsilibas-Davis, <em>Great
         Times, Good Times: The Odyssey of Maurice Barrymore</em> (New York: Knopf
      Doubleday Publishing Group, 1977).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03749_n2">2. A play by William Gillette
      (1853–1937), set during the Civil War, and now recognized as having a
      significant influence on modern realism in American drama. It was first
      performed in 1886 in the Madison Square Theatre, followed by numerous revivals
      in New York and other cities, including the 1888 Academy performances starring
      Barrymore as the handsome and earnest Colonel Prescott.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4269">3. Benjamin Harrison (1833–1901)
      was the twenty-third U.S. president and grandson of the ninth president, William
      Henry Harrison. Harrison was the Republican nominee who defeated Democratic
      incumbent Grover Cleveland in 1888.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6116">4. William Cullen Bryant
      (1794–1878) was a famous poet and journalist who also served as the
      Editor-in-Chief of the <em>New York Evening Post</em> from 1828 to
      1878.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03749_n1">5. Scovel is referencing
      Bryant's poem "The May Sun Sheds An Amber Light."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4126">6. William J. "Billy" Thompson
      (1848–1911), known as "The Duke of Gloucester" and "The Statesman," was a
      friend of Whitman's who operated a hotel, race track, and amusement park on the
      beach overlooking the Delaware River at Gloucester, New Jersey. His shad and
      champagne dinners for Whitman were something of a tradition. See William Sloane
      Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> (1896),
      15–16.<a href="#r6">[back]
