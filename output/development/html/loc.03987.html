   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0590">1. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0589">2. Edwin Stafford (1856–1906) was the brother of
      Harry Stafford, a close acquaintance of Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0852">3. George Stafford was the father of
      Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's
      parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near
      Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. For more
      on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>" <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, eds., (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 685.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00417_n3">4. Lizzie H. Hider was
      shortly to marry Wesley Stafford, Harry's cousin (see the letter from Whitman to
      Susan Stafford of ). They occupied
      the former home of Susan and George Stafford (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r4">[back]
