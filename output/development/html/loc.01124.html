      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I 
      rec<u>d</u>
      
       a magazine (the Galaxy) from you yesterday, which I have
      been preparing in a little to day, but the day has been so beautiful &amp; the charm
      of the open air so great that I could not long keep my eyes on the printed page. The
      season is at last fairly in for it, and the fruit trees are all getting in bloom.
      My
      bees are working like beavers &amp; there is a stream of golden thighs pouring into
      the hive all the time. I can do almost anything with them &amp; they wont sting me.
      Yesterday I turned a hive up &amp; pruned it, that is cut out a lot of old dirty
      comb; the little fellows were badly frightened &amp; came pouring out in great
      consternation, but did not offer to sting me. I am 
      
       going to transfer a
      swarm in a day or two to a new style of hive. I spend all my time at work about the
      place &amp; like it much. I run over to M. to look after bank matters for a day or
      two then back here. The house is being plastered &amp; will be finished during the
      summer. The wrens &amp; robins &amp; phoebe birds have already taken possession of
      various nooks of it, &amp; if they are allowed to go on with their building I must
      stop mine. During that snow storm the last of april the Hermit thrush took refuge
      in
      it. We are surrounded with birds here &amp; they are a great comfort &amp; delight
      to me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your room is ready for you &amp; your breakfast plate warmed. When will you come? I
      know the change would do you good &amp; your presence would certainly do us good. We
      are counting on your coming &amp; do not disappoint us. I will meet you in N.Y. if
      you will tell me when. Let us hear from you soon. Ursula sends love.
   </p>

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
