      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, every thing is just about the same. I rec'd your letter New Years. I have rec'd
      a small present from Heyde—he sent me a small stereoscope,<sup><a href="#tex.00183_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> that is to put pictures in,
      &amp; look through it, &amp; it magnifies them, &amp; makes them look like the real
      thing—it has some beautiful views of scenes in Vermont—I forget whether
      I told you that I sent Han some gloves &amp; a $5 bill, Christmas—so I
      suppose this is in return—He says Han rec'd the parcels.<sup><a href="#tex.00183_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Mrs. Grayson<sup><a href="#tex.00183_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> is still living—she is slightly better—I
      go [to] the hospital now oftener than usual—there are several very
      low—I just go, for an hour or so, [a] time—I had rather go than
      not—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Every thing is covered with snow here, looks wintry enough—cold weather, but
      somehow I like it—I have no fire in my room, so far, this winter—I have
      rec'd a letter from Mrs. Price. You must tell me how George is getting along with
      his business. You might ask George whether any thing could be done with $500
      cash about getting a lot &amp; moderate-sized two story house to have say 15 or
      $1600 on mortagage?—whether they could get some one to take the rest on
      mortgage, so as to save themselves<sup><a href="#tex.00183_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mat, I went to the opera last [night]—went alone—I was much pleased
      —the piece was Ernani<sup><a href="#tex.00183_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—first
      amusement I have been to in a year, except once to hear Ristori<sup><a href="#tex.00183_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      —Good by, mother dear.

   <p>I sent Jeff some envelopes for you a week ago.</p>
