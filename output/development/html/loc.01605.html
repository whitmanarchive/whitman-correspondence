   <p>We enclose the proof of your second article; but would much prefer that you should get the copy strait the first time. Such [
      <span class="unclear">very?</span>]
        heavy corrections in proof cause great embarrassment and expense in a newspaper office.
      We are quite willing to give proofs for verbal corrections; but we do not like to
      reset and readjust so largely. So please have a care to fix your copy correctly before
      sending it in.
