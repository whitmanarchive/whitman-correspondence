   <p>I am agreeable to the Lecture project—<em>if it could be well put through</em>—About the middle of April (the anniversary of the eve or night of Lincoln's murder)
      might be a good night—Every thing would depend on how it was fixed up &amp; prepared for
      &amp; put through—Let me hear more particulars—I could be ready to splurge April 14th
      or 15th—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am well, considering—in good flesh, appetite &amp; trim generally—Only return'd last
      night from a long jaunt &amp; absence down at my secluded creek—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Write me immediately, &amp; I will you—</p>
   
   
   <p>I am thoroughly willing &amp; agreeable—</p>
