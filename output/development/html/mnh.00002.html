   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Elisa Seaman Leggett,
      grandmother of the artist Percy Ives, corresponded sporadically with Whitman
      from 1880 until his death. A number of her letters to him are reprinted in
      Thomas Donaldson's <em>Walt Whitman: The Man</em> (New York:
      Francis P. Harper, 1896), 239–48. See also Joann P. Krieg, "Walt Whitman's
      Long Island Friend: Elisa Seaman Leggett," <em>Long Island
         Historical Journal</em> 9 (Spring 1997), 223–33.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="mnh.00002_n4">1. This letter is
      addressed: Mrs: E. S. Leggett | 169 East Elizabeth St: | Detroit Mich:. It is
      postmarked: Camden N.J. | Jun 8 | 1 30 PM | 1886; Philadelphia, PA | Transit |
      June 8 | 8 PM | 1886.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="mnh.00002_n2">2. Leggett sent Elias
      Hicks's <em>A Defence of the Christian Doctrines of the Society of
         Friends; being a reply to the charge of denying the three that bear record
         in heaven, the divinity and atonement of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
         and the authenticity and divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, recently
         revived against the early Quakers</em> (Philadelphia, 1825). Her
      accompanying letter to Whitman is apparently lost.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="mnh.00002_n3">3. Percy Ives, grandson of
      Elisa Leggett, was an aspiring artist who made several pencil sketches of
      Whitman on December 21, 1881. They resulted in the oil painting now in the
      Feinberg Collection (Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On , Whitman wrote to Percy in answer
      to a letter now lost. See Charles E. Feinberg, "Percy Ives, Detroit and Walt
      Whitman," <em>Detroit Historical Society Bulletin</em> 16
      (February 1960), 5–8.<a href="#r3">[back]
