      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr Whitman
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Last year, in June '78. I was the means of introducing your book to a Mrs Alexander, in the North of Ireland. She wrote at that
      time to you, enclosing a money order for £1-6-0 for one of your books, I think
      the Two Rivulets. A couple of months afterwards I heard that she
      had never received any answer, &amp; after some time I wrote to my friend Professor
      Dowden<sup><a href="#n0199" id="r1">1</a></sup> whom I knew to be in correspondence with you, asking him
      to mention the circumstance to you when he next wrote. I think he must have
      forgotten to do this, as I have heard again today that Mrs Alexander has not received the book. Therefore I thought better to
      write to you myself, as having given her your address, &amp;c. I feel myself in a certain
      degree
      responsible. I heard that at the time you should have received her letter you were
      away
      from home. I concluded that the letter failed somehow to reach you. And it has also
      occurred to me that perhaps your last edition is out &amp; you have no more copies
      to send—or that you may have mislaid the letter &amp; address.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So I should be much obliged if you would let me have a line today whether you ever received
      it, or not, &amp; if your books are obtainable from you still in the usual way.
   </p>
   
   <p>You have forgotten no doubt a letter I wrote you some years ago while an
      undergraduate in College, thanking you as deeply as I could find words to do for the
      spiritual health and thought I had found [
      <span class="unclear">or gained?</span>]
       in the Leaves of
      Grass. I cannot let this occasion pass without renewing my
      thanks, sending you again my greeting and love. Your book has travelled with me
      wherever I have gone. I have joined hands with you in it, tried to realize its
      ideals in my life; and to [
      <span class="unclear">lead?</span>]
       others to do so, often I am glad to say with success. homage like this you
      must have often received, nevertheless I think you will hardly think very lightly of any one—and
      this makes me feel encouraged to tell you freely what you have done
      for me.

   <p>P.S. If you will kindly send Mrs Alexander the Two Rivulets,
      &amp; let me know, I will enclose you the money if not received. Her address is

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.

         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0199">1. Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
