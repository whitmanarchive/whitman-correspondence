   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived with
      William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later John
      Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington years.
      William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor often complained about the
      various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his death. However, his
      government work was relieved by the presence of Whitman, whom he was to love and
      venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
      vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
      pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
      important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
      those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
      O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
      sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
      first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910], 513). For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see Deshae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>.

   <p id="nyp.00188_n2">2. Walt Whitman left
      Washington on June 22, 1864. On July 5, 1864, Ellen O'Connor wrote: "It will be
      two weeks to-morrow since you left us, and I have missed you terribly every
      minute of the time. I think I never in my life felt so wholly blue and unhappy
      about any one's going away as I did, and have since, about your going. I began
      to be really superstitious I felt so badly. I did not think that you were going
      to die, but I could not possibly overcome the feeling that our dear and pleasant
      circle was broken, and it seemed to me that we four [the O'Connors, Charles
      Eldridge, and Whitman] should not be together any more as we have been. . . .
      Ah! Walt, I don't believe other people need you as much as we do. I am <em>sure</em> they don't need you as much as <em>I</em> do" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection).<a href="#r2">[back]
