   <p>Your letter in answer to my note came to hand this a.m. I was glad to hear from you,
      Walt, and hope you will continue to write often while you stay in Boston. It will
      be a good way for you to pass some leisure time as I do not doubt you will have plenty
      of it on your hands.
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt, I am glad, very glad, you have got things fairly squared. I do not care so much
      about the style the book comes out in. I want to see it out and have no doubt the
      style, writing, etc. will be no disgrace to <u>Boston</u>. You know I have always had a very high opinion of the people of the <u>City of Nations</u>.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have not seen any of the folks up town, but they will undoubtedly be very glad of
      your success.
   </p>
   
   <p>You are well of in Boston this weather, Walt. I cannot see across the streets. The
      dust is moving in a dense mass through the streets as dust in no other city but NY
      can move.—It is actually sickening.
   </p>
   
   <p>I want you to look closely at the Municipal affairs of Boston, and comparing them
      with those of New York, give me the conclusion you arrive at regarding their respective
      good and bad qualities.—
   </p>
   
   <p>If you want to form the acquaintance of any Boston Stage men, get on one of those
      stages running to Charlestown Bridge, or Chelsea Ferry, &amp; enquire for Charley Hollis
      or Ed Morgan, mention my name, and introduce yourself as my friend.—<sup><a href="#loc.00567_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am obliged to you for your kind offer of sending me a few of the sheets in advance
      of Publication, and hope you will not forget it.—
   </p>
   
   <p>Bob and I had quite a long walk together in Central Park late Sunday.<sup><a href="#loc.00567_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      We talked much of you, and in anticipation had some long strolls together in the Park
      this summer. It is a noble place, and Boston can no longer point exultingly to their
      common as the finest park in America.
   </p>
   
   <p>By the way, what do you think of the common?</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Fred Vaughan was a young

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00567_n2">1. The <em>Boston, Massachusetts 1860 City Directory</em> lists Edward Morgan of 928
      Washington Street as a "driver." Charles I. Hollis of 30 West Brookline Street
      is also listed as a "driver." The <em>Boston Daily Atlas</em>
      reported on December 26, 1853, that "Charles Hollis, omnibus driver, was charged
      with assaulting George Brown, another driver, with his whip. Hollis acknowledged
      the offence, and Justice Russell sentenced him to pay a fine of $30 and costs,
      and if the same be not paid within twenty-four hours, then to be imprisoned in
      the common jail for three months; also to give bonds in $200 to keep the peace
      and be of good behavior for the term of six months." On November 18, 1854, the
      <em>Atlas</em> reported that Charles Hollis "was held in $200
      for trial" for "striking a man named Wilson with a whip."<a href="#r1">[back]
