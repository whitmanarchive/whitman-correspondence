      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The change down here has refreshed me more than usual and I find my Mother still
      wonderful for her years (the 89th), able to get out
      daily in her Bath chair for two or three hours— to enjoy our being with her,
      and suffering little or no pain from rheumatism now.—I hope you have had as
      glorious a summer &amp; harvest as we have and that you are able to be much out of
      doors and absorb the health-giving influences dear Friend. Such mornings! So fresh
      and invigorating. I have been before breakfast mostly in a beautiful garden (the old
      Priory garden) with my beloved Poems and the dew laden flowers and liquid light and
      sweet fresh air, &amp; the sparkle of the pond &amp; delicious greenness of the
      meadows beyond &amp; rustling trees and had a joyful time with you my
      darling—Sometimes with thoughts that lay hold on "the solid prizes of the
      Universe" sometimes so busy building up a home in America, thinking, dreaming,  hoping, loving,
      groping among dim shadows, straining wistful eyes into the dim distance—then
      to my Poems again—ah! not groping then, but hand in hand with you breathing
      the air you breathe, with eyes ardently fixed in the same direction your eyes look,
      heart beating strong with the same hopes, aspirations, yours beats with. It does not
      need to be American to love America and to believe in the great future of humanity
      there; it is enough to be human, still more English, to do that. I love &amp;
      believe in &amp; understand her in &amp; through you: but was always drawn towards
      her, always a believer though in a vaguer way that a new glorious day for men &amp;
      women was dawning there, and recognized a new, distinctive American quality very
      congenial to me, even in American virtues [
      <span class="unclear">whom?</span>]
       you not perhaps rate highly or regard as decisively
      national, not adequately  or commandingly so at any rate. Did I ever tell you the cousin of mine who owns the Priory here fought for two years in the Secession war
      in the army of the Potomac when Burnside &amp; McClellan were at the head? John
      Cowardine was Major in a Cavalry regiment—was at Vicksburg, Frederickburg,
      &amp;c. Never wounded, or but slightly—had a good deal of outpost duty, being
      just the right sort of man for that &amp; has letters of approval from his Generals
      of which he is not a little proud. Before that fought under the Stars &amp; Stripes
      in Mexico &amp; has had a curiously adventurous career which he commenced by running
      away from a military college where he was being prepared for a cadetship, &amp;
      enlisting as a private—getting out of that by &amp; bye and working his way
      before the mast as a sailor—then mining in California—then in Australia,
      riding steeple chases, keeper of the Melrose hounds, market gardening, hotel
      keeping—then on his way back to California cast ashore on one of  the Navigator Islands
      where he remained for six months the only white man among savages who were friendly
      &amp; made much of him—now, come into a good estate, married to a woman who
      seems to suit him well &amp; is healthy, cheerful rich &amp; handsome, he has fallen
      into indifferent health &amp; considerable depression of spirits. Perhaps he finds
      the atmosphere of Squirearchical gentility very
      stagnant, the bed of roses stifling—perhaps too the severe privations he has
      at different times undergone have injured him. I often think he was perhaps one of
      those your eyes rested on with pride &amp; admiration—"handsome tan-faced,
      dressed in blue." He is the very ideal of a soldier in appearance &amp;
      bearing—has now some fine children of whom he is very fond. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It was just this time year I received the precious letter and ring that put peace
      and
      joy and yet such pain of yearning into my  heart—pain for you, my Darling. O
      sorrowing helpless love that waits and must wait useless, afar off, while you
      suffer—But trying every day of my life to grow fitter more capable of being
      your comfort and joy and true comrade—never to cease trying this side death or
      the other— rejoicing in my children more than I ever rejoiced in them before
      now that in and through you I for the first time see and understand humanity (myself
      included) its divine nature, its possibilities, nay, its certainties. How I do long
      for you to see my children dear Friend, and for them to see and love you as they
      will love you, and all their nature unfold and grow more vigorously and joyously
      under your influence. Gracie,
       of whom you have
      photographs, grows fast,—is such a fair blooming
      girl. I hope soon to send you one of Beatrice too. They have been enjoying their visit here and are now gone
      home. Gracie for school, Beatrice for the examination at Apoth. Hall she is hoping
      to get through. Then she is coming here to be with my Mother &amp; I going back to
      London: We mean now one or other of us always to be with my Mother here. Herby has had such a happy time with his brother in
      Wales—&amp; is looking as brown as a nut &amp; full of health &amp;
      life—he had a swim in the sea every day. He did succeed in getting into the
      Academy, &amp; will begin work there Oct. 1st! I  received the welcome
      sign from you—the paper with a deeply interesting narration of the Polaris
      &amp; much else. Be sure dear Friend if there is a word about your health in any
      paper, to send it me—that is what I search for so eagerly—to have the
      joyful news you are getting on—but even if it is but so very very slowly still
      I would rather know the truth—I do not like thinking of you mistakenly. I want
      to send you the thoughts the yearnings that belong to you the cherishing love that
      enfolds you most tenderly of all when you suffer—O if I could send it! and the
      cheerful companionship, beguiling the time while strength creeps back— I hope
      your little nieces at St. Louis are well. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Good bye my dearest Friend</p>
   
   <p>Herby, the only one here with me, would like to join his love with mine. </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
