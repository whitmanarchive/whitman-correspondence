      <br></br>Dear Sir &amp; Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your magazine with the article on my book has safely reached me—&amp; a second copy in
      sheets—also your last letter.<sup><a href="#rlc.00004_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I only write now to make prompt, brief acknowledgment. I have gleaned a general knowledge
      of the article, &amp; it pleases me very much. I have seen Clemens Petersen in New York,
      &amp; he ran over it for me.<sup><a href="#rlc.00004_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> He has been very ill with erysipelas, but is now nearly well.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am to return to Washington in two or three days. I will write to you thence more
      fully, &amp; hope to continue having letters from you—My address will be Solicitor's Office,
      Treasury.<sup><a href="#rlc.00004_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>

      <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em>, wrote to Walt Whitman on
      October 19, 1871: "I intend to write an article about yourself and your writings
      in the above named periodical which is very much read in all the Scandinavian
      countries. . . . I therefore take the liberty to ask you, if you should not be
      willing to afford some new communications of yourself and your poetry to this
      purpose" (Library of Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]
