   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3039">1. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">2. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">4. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4979">5. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00238_n3">6. Whitman is referring to his
      lecture entitled "The Death of Abraham Lincoln," which he delivered in New York
      City on Thursday, April 14, 1887. He first delivered this lecture in New York in
      1879 and would deliver it at least eight other times over the succeeding years,
      delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He had published a version of
      the lecture as "Death of Abraham Lincoln" in <em>Specimen
         Days</em> (1882–83). For more on the lecture, see Larry D. Griffin,
      "'Death of Abraham Lincoln,'" <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, ed. (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 169–170.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03486_n1">7. Andrew Carnegie
      (1835–1919), the prominent industrialist and admirer of Whitman, had
      donated twice to the support of the aged poet.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00466_n1">8. Whitman has here misspelled
      the name of Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1848–1907), an Irish-born sculptor
      raised in New York who became well-known for his many monuments depicting Civil
      War figures, including his monument to Admiral Farragut in New York's Madison
      Square Park, the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial on Boston Common, and his "Standing
      Lincoln" in Chicago's Lincoln Park. His bust of Whitman unfortunately never made
      it beyond the early planning stages.<a href="#r8">[back]
