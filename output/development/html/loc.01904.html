      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will send you a few lines in reply to your kind letter of 16 January, which I have
      received today. That the papers are in my hands you probably are informed of at
      present. On the 5th January I wrote to Claiusen and 
      inclose
      
       a sheet for you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am at present composing my article; in the [illegible] of March it shall be in your
      hands.  If I did not
      write the English language so very imperfectly I should have a great deal of things
      to tell you privately. Of course the facts, you are pointing at have not escaped me.
      The newspaper articles as well as the book of John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      have given me all [illegible] information. J. B's book has [
      <span class="unclear">made?</span>]
       me very great pleasure, the article of
      the English lady in "The Radical" also.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your "Democratic vistas" I have yet not read completely. What I have read has
      astonished and delighted me. There are words of a  genius superior to all the political and
      literary nonentities of the day and worthy the great horizons of your proud country,
      from which nevertheless the names of [
      <span class="unclear">radi?</span>]
      cals as James Fisk have hithe[
      <span class="unclear">rto?</span>]
       been the most resounding.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I read yesterday some part of "
      Democratical
      
       Vistas" to the Professor Rasmus Nielsen,<sup><a href="#n0443" id="r2">2</a></sup> one great
      Scandinavian philosopher and according to [
      <span class="unclear">my?</span>]
       conviction the mightiest [illegible] living genius of the world at
      present—he was astonished and delighted, he also! Your ideas and ours are meeting
       a glad
      congenialness [illegible]
      [
      <span class="unclear">fighting with?</span>]
       the
      same combat!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The rest you shall have through the printer would there are Danes enough in
      Washington and a verbal transaction you may easily have. Clausen has a number of the
      periodical for November 1871; among its contents is an article of the democracy of
      America. Perhaps it could have interest for you to get acquainted with it.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The Swede Peter Carl Rudolph
      Schmidt (1836–1899) was the editor of the idealist <em>For
         Idé og Virkelighed</em> ("For Idea and Reality") and had translated
      Whitman's <em>Democratic Vistas</em> into Danish in 1871 (see the

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0129">1. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0443">2. Rasmus Nielsen (1809–1884) was a Danish
      Hegelian philosopher and contemporary of Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855). In
      1870, Nielsen published his <em>Philosophy of Religion</em>, in
      which he argued (against the Hegelian model) that religious faith and scientific
      knowledge were not mutually exclusive categories, permitting faith in Christian
      dogma to exist simultaneously with scientific advances.<a href="#r2">[back]
