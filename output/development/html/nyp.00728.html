      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman:
      
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>I believe you told me sometime ago that you had a friend at Los Angeles, Cal. 
      If you have, I wish you would give me a line of introduction to
      him for my brother Bertie (Albert)<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r1">1</a></sup> who has just left hospital after a month's
      illness with typhoid fever, and who at such a distance from home and friends feels
      (I'm afraid) homesick and possibly despondent. If I had known earlier I would have
      gone on to Los Angeles myself, to nurse the lad; but this seems unnecessary now that
      he is able to get about again. You will easily understand, however, that I feel
      pretty anxious, and if you can let me have a line as I suggest, it will be a great
      help.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Down here I've been talking again about the New Poetry—on Monday in Boston, and
      last night before the Harvard students who gave me a very hearty reception—the
      best I've had so far. I find there is quite an earnest feeling for Leaves of Grass
      among a great many of them. You have no doubt got their invitation to lecture by
      this time—which I told you sometime ago they were preparing to send.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Next week (as you will see by my enclosed circular) I am to speak in Chickering Hall
      on Literary London—rather a rash adventure, I'm afraid.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Has Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> returned yet? I must write and ask him whether he
      can arrange a talk at London, Ontario, or not.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
