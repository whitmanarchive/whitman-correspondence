   <p>Mama dear, I believe I must send you a line for Saturday though I have little or nothing
      to write about—I am sitting here alone in the office, writing by my lamp—I went over
      to Baltimore last evening for a little trip—saw Mr. Emerson—he lectured there—John
      Burroughs wanted to go over &amp; hear him—it was not interesting to me at all<sup><a href="#pml.00037_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—but we had a pleasant little jaunt—got back about ½ past 11—Nothing different in
      the office—I except to go over in the Treasury Building, in the office of the Solicitor of the Treasury,
      as I told you—the new Attorney Gen'l Mr. Williams<sup><a href="#pml.00037_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> has assigned me there—but several important bits of work have had to be done just
      now, &amp; today &amp; yesterday I have had to do them—(as the old ladies say "I guess they'll
      miss me a good deal more than they 'spected")—so I have been held on to here so far—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mama dear, I hope this will find you well of your cold—and that you'll have a good
      Sunday—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Congress convenes again next Monday—I met a man who saw Jeff about nine days ago in
      St. Louis. Good bye for this time, dear mother—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pml.00037_n1">1. According to the
      Baltimore <em>American</em>, Emerson lectured at the Peabody
      Institute on Tuesday, January 2, 1872, on the subject "Imagination and Poetry."
      Yet Walt Whitman wrote as though he had heard Emerson on Thursday, January 4,
      1872. See Ralph Rusk, <em>Letters of Ralph Waldo Emerson</em> (New
      York: Columbia University Press, 1939), 6, 187–197. Walt Whitman conveyed
      to Emerson an invitation from Charles Sumner; see Rusk, 6, 193.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00037_n2">2. Note also Walt Whitman's
      comment on an Emerson lecture in his  letter to Edward Dowden. Not surprisingly, Burroughs' reactions
      were almost identical: he too believed that Emerson failed to perceive "the
      needs of the American people today" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
      65–66).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00037_n4">3. George Henry Williams
      (1820–1910), U.S. Senator from Oregon, served as Attorney General from
      1871 to 1875. Williams dismissed Walt Whitman on June 30, 1874; Whitman
      "respectfully acknowledged" his dismissal in his  letter to Williams.<a href="#r3">[back]
