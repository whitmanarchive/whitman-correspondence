   <p>Coming home from our [illegible],—a great reading [
      <span class="unclear">union?</span>]
       with a large number of papers and periodicals from all countries of the earth—and
      having there with great pleasure read in the Norwegian [
      <span class="unclear">"Aftenbladet" (Even Magazine)?</span>]
       [illegible] the first [
      <span class="unclear">real?</span>]
       criticism of your book, [
      <span class="unclear">I found?</span>]
       on my table your kind letter of March 19, in reply to which I immediately write these
      lines to let you know the [
      <span class="unclear">fact?</span>]
      .
      
      
      
      The author is a young man in my years; his name is Kristian Elster, he is living at
      present in Throndhjem (English: Drontheim). I received a letter from him this morning
      of March 28 announcing that he had written the criticism but expressing a great fear
      that the editor (in Christiania) would not print it. In the war, on the [
      <span class="unclear">running sea?</span>]
       the Norwegians are a people of heroes; but in their civil and literary life they
      are a race of cowards.  Either the author or the editor will forward a copy of the
      number to you. I will beg you to let it be <u>carefully</u> translated to you. Elster speaks of a certain affinity between the author and his
      translator, others have [
      <span class="unclear">made?</span>]
      
      
      
      the same remark.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In the whole I have sent you 1) Fædrelandet 2) [
      <span class="unclear">Norg fjern?</span>]
      . 3) Dagbladet 4)[
      <span class="unclear">Folkets Avis?</span>]
      . The last paper (people's paper) is [
      <span class="unclear">long?</span>]
       and the editor is the [
      <span class="unclear">donor?</span>]
       of the [
      <span class="unclear">basest?</span>]
       Copenhagen public.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>All the other critics have been in the same case with you as during many years our
      critics have been with [
      <span class="unclear">Grundtvig ?</span>]
      : when the objections against the books are exhausted, <u>the man</u> is [
      <span class="unclear">standing?</span>]
       then  invulnerable against all the [
      <span class="unclear">dated?</span>]
       errors  and [
      <span class="unclear">exposing?</span>]
       the critic himself!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And therefore your [
      <span class="unclear">adversants?</span>]
       here are at the bottom your friends. But your proper friends are [
      <span class="unclear">among?</span>]
        
      
      
      
      the peasantry and the teachers of the village schools and the <u>very few</u>, to whom culture has been as  poison (among these especially the women.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am very glad to hear that your brother and sister are with you in your lone loneomeness.</p>
   
   
   <p>I should be glad to know some thing about John Burroughs; his book has made his [
      <span class="unclear">individuality?</span>]
       dear to me.
