   <p>Edith &amp; another girl<sup><a href="#nyp.00586_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> have been to see me
      to-day—nearly two hours—a nice visit—they are well—appear to
      be enjoying their trip—we all liked them much—they have been to
      Niagara—I wrote you a while ago that the books had come, &amp; that I liked
      the get up of them—I will send very soon some more stuff for the "Democratic
      Vistas,&amp;c. &amp;c." Vol. Fine summer weather—
