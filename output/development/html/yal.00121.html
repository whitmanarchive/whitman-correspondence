   <p>Agreeable to promise I take the few leisure moments allotted to me to drop you a few
      lines. We started from Washington on the 31st of of
      March and arrived at Omaha Neb on the 19th of April and
      layed over 
      their
      
       for orders. And then started for Fort D. A. Russell Wyoming and remained 
      their
      
       a few days and started on a March through the Country for Chug Creek about 50 miles from the Fort.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>We have a very pretty little Camp with one or two Exceptions that is shade and lumber
      to fix it up in the proper 
      Maner
      
      . it is situated in a Valley and near the Creek. the Camp is Entirely
      surrounded by Water. I wish you to go to the Paymaster General for me and request
      him to see if he can do anything in regard to that Bounty claim of mine, in the
      hands of 
      Jno
      
       H Hodgest Winchester Virginia. And if he cannot I wish you to take it in
      hands and collect it if possible and you shall be rewarded for your trouble. I will
      close for the present
   </p>
