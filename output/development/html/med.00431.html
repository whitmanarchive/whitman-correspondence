   <p>Your letter of the 20th (for committee) has reached me here. I accept with pleasure
      the
      invitation to deliver a poem to your college &amp; visitors next June. Without any thing
      very definite at this moment, my idea is of a poem, fitting in not 
      unappropriately
      
       to such an occasion, the recital of which would not occupy more than 30 minutes.
      All the pay I would want would be enough to pay my expenses, transportation &amp;c.,
      probably between 30 and $40, certainly not more than the latter sum. Please acknowledge
      this
      &amp; please write me more particulars about your college, where it is, specialties, if
      any
      &amp;c. I am stopping here, not entirely well, but able to get around, recovering from
      an
      attack of paralysis of over a year ago. 
   </p>

   <p id="med.00431_n2">2. On March 20, 1874, Mann invited Whitman to
      deliver, on June 17, 1874, a poem before the Mathematician Society of Tufts
      College, a society "of young men of the Col. desiring to become more proficient
      in the art of speaking, writing and debate." Mann replied to Whitman's queries
      on April 2, 1874 (Oscar Lion). Whitman composed "Song of the Universal" for the
      occasion, but, unable to deliver the poem in person, sent it to Mann on June 11,
      1874.<a href="#r2">[back]
