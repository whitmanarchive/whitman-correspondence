      My dear old friend,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I was greatly pleased at receiving your kind postcard of Dec. 31st. this morning &amp;
      I thank you
      most cordially for it &amp; for the thoughtful consideration which prompted you to write
      it. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I was extremely sorry to learn from it, though, that there was then so little real
      improvement in 
      yr. physical condition—"health points much the same, (not favourable)," 
      so says the p.c.—but I am glad to know that you were in "fair spirits" &amp; able to sit
      up &amp; 
      "write a little."         
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      My best thanks to you, too, for your kind offer to "send, or notify" me of, any thing
      you may write
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I wish from the bottom of my heart that I could do something to <u>really</u> help you, &amp; 
      it grieves me to think how powerless I am; for I can do nothing but write to you &amp;
      try to shew
       you something 
      of a personal affection for you which is almost filial in its intensity &amp; of the gratitude
      with which my heart 
      is filled to overflowing, for all your great &amp; countless benefactions to me. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      God bless &amp; keep you now &amp; always, my life's Blessing, my Soul's Guide, Philosopher,
      Friend &amp; Comrade Perfect!
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      By last mail I received a kind letter from Mrs O'Connor<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r1">1</a></sup> acknowledging the receipt of the copy 
      of my "notes" sent at your request. In it she informs me that her late husband's story,
      "The Brazen Android," is to appear in 
      the <u>Atlantic Monthly</u> for April &amp; May &amp; the volume containing all the seven stories later. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I have also had a friendly &amp; affectionate letter from John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r2">2</a></sup> in wh. he says that he is pleased with the pamphlet, 
      &amp; compliments me upon my sketch of you.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I send you a Bolton paper containing an account of a serious railway collision to
      which I was called professionally. It was a 
      distressing scene but fortunately
      
      it has not been attended with any fatal results. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Today there are signs that our long frost is breaking up as a thaw, which seems [
      <span class="unclear">general?</span>]
      , 
      has fairly set in. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I enclose a par., cut from the <u>Family Herald</u> (London), in which your name occurs. It shews
       that you have a 
      reader on the staff of that paper. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I hope, when this reaches you, that you will be freed from the ailments which have
      troubled you for so long or at least that you
      may be relieved from the pain &amp; able to enjoy your life in comparative comfort. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      With kindest regards to all the members of yr household &amp; with best love to yourself

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_97.html">Johnston, Dr. John (d.1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4137">1. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald
      D. Kummings, ed. (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">2. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
