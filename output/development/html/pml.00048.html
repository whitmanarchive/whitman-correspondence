   <p>Was sorry—extremely sorry—to hear of your illness—trust you are
      well again by this time, (as fore-indicated by H[erbert]'s last)<sup><a href="#pml.00048_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—all H's books for Mrs S[tafford] came safely<sup><a href="#pml.00048_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—also letters &amp; p.o. order—rec'd the
      good, long, fine letter from B[eatrice]<sup><a href="#pml.00048_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—The S's
      are all well as usual—I am getting along capitally for me this winter so
      far—have been &amp; am writing quite a deal <em>to order</em>
      (astonishing, isn't it?)<sup><a href="#pml.00048_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—will surely send you when
      in print—I wish you would send the <em>Cedar-Plums like</em><sup><a href="#pml.00048_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> to Rossetti—(I suppose you rec'd it)—what
      silly fictitious items appear about me in some of the English papers—(about as
      bad as <em>here</em>)—trust you all had merry Christmas &amp;
      New Year's—Cold &amp; deep snow here—
