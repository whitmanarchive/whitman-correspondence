   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Logan Pearsall Smith
      (1865–1946) was an essayist and literary critic. He was the son of Robert
      Pearsall Smith, a minister and writer who befriended Whitman, and he was the
      brother of Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, one of Whitman's most avid followers.

      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">6. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
