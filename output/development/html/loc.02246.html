      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Inspired by a perusal of some of your Leaves of Grass, especially "Starting from
      Paumanok," "Song of the Open Road" &amp; "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, I dashed off the
      enclosed Sonnet, which I take the liberty of send to you, the rather to gratify my
      own pride, than to expect that you will esteem such a faulty production to be an
      honour.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      However I think it better to leave it as it is—
   </p>
   
   <p>
      
      To a Prophet.
      <br>Whitman, thy earnest cries have reached our shore,
      <br>Thou prophet of the old, &amp; new En-masse—
      <br>From world to world the glorious tidings pass,
      <br>Of which down-trodden mortals scarce before
      <br>Did dream, or if they did, with fire and gore
      <br>Raised Hell on Earth by setting class 'gainst class;
      <br>Thus crushing Freedom at her birth, alas!
      <br>And ripping up the mother that her bore.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>  
      
      But thou dost teach a common Brotherhood,
      <br>The Present joins the Past, the East the West,
      <br>And from their union springs a perfect brood,
      <br>Bound, by the sacred ties of Comradeship,
      <br>To purify our Earth from Error's pest,
      <br>Till her last Sun in waves Eternal dip.
      
      
   </p>  
   ———
   
   <p>I hope you will
      not consider me to be taking a liberty, but merely to be paying a somewhat
      antiquated tribute (spontaneously) to the honour of a great genius.
   </p>
