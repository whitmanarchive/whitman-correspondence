      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt: 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am sitting here in my bark-covered study this bright sharp day, writing you this
      note. I look from the open fire that burns in the chimney, &amp; the wood of which I
      cut &amp; hauled up the hill myself, out of the window on to the river just covered
      with new ice, on off over the brown gray landscape. I am feeling well, better than
      one year  ago
      this time, my summers work I think has put something into me I much needed. I am
      still busy nearly every day in the open air. There is no snow &amp; the ground for the
      past few days has been like iron. As soon as the snow comes we shall probably go to
      Po'Keepsie to board a while. Julian<sup><a href="#loc.01151_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> says he rather stay here, &amp; he likes the
      country, &amp; likes the school here. He learns well &amp; begins to read books on
      his own hook. The other
      day at the close of the term of school he read his first composition in public. It
      was a real piece.  It was about "Papas Dogs" &amp; gave much amusement. He spoke a couple of pieces
      also, &amp; easily carried off the honors. He is now reading "Tom Brown at Rugby."<sup><a href="#loc.01166_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> I
      trust, dear Walt, you are better than when you wrote a couple of weeks ago, &amp;
      that you will have a fairly good Christmas. If you are not in the mood to write me
      yourself ask Horace Trauble <sup><a href="#n4267" id="r3">3</a></sup> to drop me a 
      card. Nothing notable comes to or happens to me. I read a
      little, write none at all, go nowhere, &amp; try to make the most of the [
      <span class="unclear">prose?</span>]
       of life. If I could
      only continue my farm work or else hibernate like a woodchuck  I should be glad. If you have any
      late news from O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r4">4</a></sup> please let me have it. With much love
      &amp; a merry Christmas to you I am

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see

   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
