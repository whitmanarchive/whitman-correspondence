      <br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I own the Stereotype plates of your Poem, "Leaves of Grass" I bought them of the
      assigness of Thayer &amp; Eldridge at the time of their failure. I should like to sell
      them &amp; did not know but you would like to purchase if you could get them at the
      right figure. I do not know what they cost, but my impression is, that it was somewhere
      in the neighborhood of $800. I would be pleased to have you state what you would give
      for them, or to know if you could refer me to any publisher who would be likely to
      purchase. I think you could make better arrangements with publishers if you owned the Stereotype
      plates
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Horace Wentworth was Thayer and Eldridge's former
      boss who later acted as the firm's creditor. Wentworth received the plates of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> as compensation for his financial
      loss when Thayer and Eldridge went bankrupt in 1861. W.W. Thayer informed
      Whitman of this change in ownership on . For Wentworth's offer to sell the plates of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and <em>Leaves of Grass Imprints</em> to
      Whitman, see his  letter.
