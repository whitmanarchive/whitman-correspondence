      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I received your letter and I do not think you can form an idea how very badly I feel
      to hear that you are not recovering faster.<sup><a href="#loc.00473_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I do so sincerely hope that you are right in your theory that the slow recovery indicates
      permanency—I hope to God, my dear Brother that you may permanently recover—
   </p>
   
   <p>Not much new with me—I have had several outside jobs lately that will pay me I think
      in time but so far they are only sources of investment
   </p>
   
   <p>How do you get along on money matters? do not fail to let me know if you have any
      prospect of being short &nbsp;I read with much regret mother's statement about the eating at George's,<sup><a href="#loc.00473_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &nbsp;it does seem too bad that with every chance to make things good and happy they should
      fail so completely on so small a cause. I hope you may carry out your idea of getting
      a little place in Washington and have Mother live there &nbsp;It would be happiness indeed
      for her, and for you too for that matter
   </p>
   
   <p>I cannot understand how it is that Loo is so stingy nor how it is that George does
      not correct it<sup><a href="#loc.00473_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I would suppose he would (and naturally he is so) prevent it at once
   </p>
   
   <p>Hattie wrote you a few days ago—I hope you have it ere this</p>
   
   <p>Write me when you can and let me know if you are in want of a little money</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00473_n1">1. Walt Whitman's letter
      of about May 8 is not extant.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00473_n2">2. On April 21, 1873,
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman commented to Walt Whitman that the George Whitman
      household would be eating a "not very good" piece of beef every day from Sunday
      "till wensday or thursday." Recognizing that her health was failing and that her
      appetite was poor, she expressed a desire for something other than "the regular
      fare" (May 1, 1873 [Trent Collection, William R. Perkins Library, Duke
      University]).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00473_n3">3. A model of thrift
      herself, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman complained frequently of the penny-saving
      ways of George's wife.<a href="#r3">[back]
