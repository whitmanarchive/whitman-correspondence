      for the poem.<sup><a href="#loc.07874_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> Please find enclosed proofs of a page of
      poetry which please return after you have examined it
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will send or bring the proof of the autobiography<sup><a href="#loc.07874_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> in a
      few days, in the meantime, if you see Mr. Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r3">3</a></sup>, will you
      tell him to please hurry up with his part of the work.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>With all good 
      wished
      
       for your good health and prosperity for the New Year,

   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
