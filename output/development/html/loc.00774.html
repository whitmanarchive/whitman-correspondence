      <br></br><br></br>Dear mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Jeff's letter came informing me of the birth of the little girl,<sup><a href="#loc.00774_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; that Matty was feeling pretty well, so far. I hope it will continue—Dear sister,
      I should much like to come home &amp; see you &amp; the little one, I am sure from Jeff's
      description it is a noble babe, &amp; as to its being a girl it is all the better. (I
      am not sure but the Whitman breed gives better women than men.)
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, mother, we are generally anticipating a lively time here or in the neighborhood,<sup><a href="#loc.00774_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> as it is probable Lee is feeling about to strike a blow on Washington, or perhaps
      right into it—&amp; as Lee is no fool, it is perhaps possible he may give us a good shake—he
      is not very far off—yesterday was a fight to the southwest of here all day, we heard the
      cannons nearly all day—the wounded are arriving in small squads every day, mostly
      cavalry, a great many Ohio men—they send off to-day from the Washington hospitals
      a great many to New York, Philadelphia, &amp;c. all who are able, to make room, which
      looks ominous—indeed it is pretty certain that there is to be some severe fighting,
      may be a great battle again, the pending week—I am getting so callous that it hardly
      arouses me at all—I fancy I should take it very quietly if I found myself in the midst
      of a desperate conflict here in Washington.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I have nothing particular to write about—I see &amp; hear nothing but new &amp; old
      cases of my poor suffering boys in Hospitals, &amp; I dare say you have had enough of
      such things—I have not missed a day at Hospital I think for more than three weeks—I
      get more &amp; more wound round—poor young men—there are some cases that would literally
      sink &amp; give up, if I did not pass a portion of the time with them—I have quite made
      up my mind about the lecturing &amp;c project—I have no doubt it will succeed well enough,
      the way I shall put it in operation—you know, mother, it is to raise funds to enable me to continue my Hospital
      ministrations, on a more free handed scale—As to the Sanitary Commissions &amp; the like,
      I am sick of them all, &amp; would not accept any of their berths—you ought to see the
      way the men as they lie helpless in bed turn away their faces from the sight of these
      Agents, Chaplains &amp;c. (<em>hirelings</em> as Elias Hicks<sup><a href="#loc.00774_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> would call them—they seem to me always a set of foxes &amp; wolves)—they get well paid,
      &amp; are always incompetent &amp; disagreeable—As I told you before the only good fellows
      I have met are the Christian Commissioners—they go everywhere &amp; receive no pay<sup><a href="#loc.00774_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear, dear mother, I want much to see you &amp; dear Matty too, I send you both [my] best
      love, &amp; Jeff too—the pictures came—I have not heard from George nor Han. I write a
      day earlier than usual.

   <p>We here think Vicksburgh is ours<sup><a href="#loc.00774_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—the probability is that it has capitulated—&amp; there has been no general assault—can't
      tell yet whether the 51st went there—we are having very fine weather here to-day—rained
      last night.

   <p id="loc.00774_n1">1. Jessie Louisa Whitman was
      born June 17, 1863 (Charles I. Glicksberg, <em>Walt Whitman and
         the Civil War</em> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1933],

      the purpose of contradicting all erroneous reports, and giving quiet to the
      public mind," that "<em>No enemy is on or near the old Bull Run
