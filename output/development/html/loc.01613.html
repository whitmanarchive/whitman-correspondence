      <br></br><br></br>To Walt Whitman Esq,
      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I thank you very much for your letter received this morning. Its frank and pleasant
      tone makes me regret even more than I should otherwise have done, to feel myself
      obliged to say at once that I do not see my way to bringing out a complete edition
      of your poems in England. I admire them  so very much myself that I should much
      like to do it but there are certain pieces (among those which I admire the most)
      which would not go down in England, and it certainly would not be worth while to
      publish it again in a mutilated form, nor of course would you wish it. W. M.
      Rossetti is a great admirer of your poems and a man by no
      means squeamish yet you see he did not venture to publish them without alteration
      in
      England. I think he was wrong: they should have been published complete &amp; with
      your sanction or let alone. May I keep the volume you send me? if so I will remit
      you the price for I have tried in vain to get a complete edition through
      Trübners.
   </p>
