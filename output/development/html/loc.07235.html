   <p>A quiet, warm, dreamy, breezy, sunshiny, peaceful, Sabbath day—no sounds in the
      air but the sleepy buzzing of flies and the distant church bells—chapel is
      over and the folk mostly gone to church—I am off duty and putting in the
      morning in the office writing a batch of letters—have just written to Mrs
      Costelloe<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—had a letter from her last
      evening—she says Mr Smith<sup><a href="#n4979" id="r3">3</a></sup> is now quite blind of one eye
      but can read with the other—she sends me a picture of Ray<sup><a href="#n3137" id="r4">4</a></sup> who seems to be
      thriving finely. I have begun my Annual Report am going to  make it pretty long this year—shall
      put in a lot about alcohol—results of its disuse at the Asylum and a
      discussion as to its mode of action upon the nerve
      centers. I shall be kept here pretty steady I guess until I get the Report off my
      hands, a month from now, after that if all be well it is quite possible I shall be
      East about the meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> business—Should <u>that</u> go as we
      think it ought this may be the last annual report I shall write—but of course
      I say nothing about that at present.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">2. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
