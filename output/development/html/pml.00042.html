      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend Abby,
      <br></br>(&amp; Dear friends all)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The letter of the 28th reached me yesterday after going wrong and was truly welcome.
      
      (I suppose you rec'd my postal card<sup><a href="#pml.00042_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> acknowledging your previous one, briefly, &amp; saying I should prefer the upper room.)
      
      Since then I have had another bad spell—has lasted some fifteen days—head, legs, 
      gastric region, <em>all</em> bad—but am to-day feeling decidedly better. I shall <em>quite 
         certainly</em> come on—cannot now [pla]n the time, but will write before—&amp; take up my quarters a
      while with you, as it seems to be agreeable, &amp; the moderate sum 
      you mention I should pay thankfully—Though badly disabled, I am perfectly able 
      to take care of myself, &amp; my sister says I am no trouble—I am sure we would all get
      along well together—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just rec'd a letter from Mrs. O'Connor, from Washington, today. Her daughter, 
      (just 16,) is not well, has had a form of measles, a second attack, quite severe,
      
      &amp; is otherwise ailing, but I think will probably come out of it all, &amp; grow stronger.
      
      I was glad to hear about your dear grandchildren—and about our friends 
      Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#pml.00042_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; Mrs. Rein<sup><a href="#pml.00042_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I am alone, in the house to-day, (except Eddy)—as my sister has gone out 
      to spend the day, &amp; my brother has gone to Easton, about his work. My brother Jeff,
      
      at St. Louis, is well—his girls are growing finely.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am sitting here in the parlor—it is about 11½—the sun has just come out, after a
      cloudy 
      half-rainy morning—is mild &amp; warm—I go out for about an hour generally about noon,
      
      with my cane, (&amp; accompanied by my little yellow &amp; white dog, a most faithful affectionate
      
      companion)—frequently take a ride in the cars, or across in the boat—the men quite
      all know me, &amp; are very kind.

   <p>Abby—mind the address—your last letter went wrong—had the wrong state—</p>
