   <p>Well Lou Dear, I suppose you got my letter from St. Louis, here I am on the
      great plains of Colorado (and Kansas)—We ride and ride all day &amp; all
      night, &amp; it is nothing but plains—but I enjoy it all very much
      indeed—as I sit in the cars writing this, (have a leaf-table before me to
      write on) 1 p m flying along, I can [illegible]<sup><a href="#mhs.00026_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> p with
      my eye, including both sides, a radius [t]wo hundred miles—emigrant
      wagons—quite frequently herds [illegible] cattle, some large
      ones—settlements 15 or 20 miles apart—no improved farms, no
      fences—(I mean along here)—but 600 miles of rolling prairie
      land—the pure cool mountain air delicious to breathe, (it is 3000 feet
      higher level here than 
      Phila:)—I am in a sleeping car,—(we left St Louis Saturday
      morning, came through Missouri—staid 4 days in Kansas)—left Topeka
      yesterday at 5 p m, &amp; will be in Denver this evening—I have got along
      very well—(two days in Lawrence, Kansas, &amp; two in Topeka)<sup><a href="#mhs.00026_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—we are now about 1800 miles or over west of 
      Phila:—I have good meals
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—there is a very sick lady aboard the cars—her husband is taking her to
      Colorado, hoping it will help her—two beautiful little children—she
      is groaning as I write—

      Denver Colorado<sup><a href="#mhs.00026_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      Evening
      </span>
   
   
   <p>I finish my letter at the hotel the American House, where I am comfortably
      housed—This is evidently a fine large busy city, beautifully
      situated—Every thing goes all right so far with me—Shall stay here
      about four days—Col
      
       Forney hasn't come on here, but turned b[ack] at Topeka &amp; has gone
      home—I am feeling well—better than before I started—hope you
      &amp; George &amp; Ed are all right

   <p>I have seen the mountains just before sunset—It was only ten minutes
      but I shall never forget it
