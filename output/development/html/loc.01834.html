      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>You know how I am situated, and can make some allowance for a brief letter, I expect
      you will like it better so, however, for I should fail to interest you if I had
      plenty time. I am pleased to know that you are enjoying your leave of absence so
      much, may you continue to do so until you return. Your favor of 2d
      
      inst.
      
       to me, and papers for others were duly received, and I am requested by the
      recipients to return their thanks for the same. I have finished reading the
      "Broadway" you sent me, and was so well pleased with it that I expect to order the following
      numbers until my favorite piece (Stretton)<sup><a href="#loc.01834_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> is concluded. I am
      interrupted every minute, and can say, in truth, that I write "under
      difficulties."
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall be very glad to hear from you again.</p>
