   <p>While knowing that you are kept too busy by your numerous friends to read many
      letters, I could not let the month pass by, without wishing you A Merry Christmas
      &amp;
      A Happy New Year with better health for 1890.
   </p>
   
   <p>I sent to the City of Mexico for some feather cards<sup><a href="#loc.04508_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> for you but they have not arrived, but
      as soon as they do will send them to you as I think you would like to see them they
      being very curios works of art
   </p>
   
   <p>We will have a <u>very</u> warm Christmas this year the weather
      being really too hot in the middle of the day
   </p>
   
   <p>I will not make this letter any longer my Dear Mr Whitman, as I know y'r time is taken
      up with many pleasant things but I want you to know that A <u>Merry Christmas</u> &amp; <u>A Happy New Year</u>
      <u>with many more years of better health for you</u>, is the wish
      of

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John W. ("Johnny") Wroth was
      the younger son of Mrs. Caroline Wroth, who was the wife of a Philadelphia
      importer, at whose residence (319 Stevens Street, Camden) Whitman took his meals
      for a period of time beginning in July 1881. Johnny moved with his mother and
      his brother James Henry ("Harry") Wroth to Albuquerque, New Mexico, soon after,
      and Whitman kept in touch with them.
