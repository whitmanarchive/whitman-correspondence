      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>It seems fitting that, as I have been writing about you, I should submit for your
      inspection what I have written, and therefore I send to you by this mail a copy of
      Murray's Magazine for the present month.<sup><a href="#loc.03216_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> Whether or not
      you will approve of what I say, I cannot tell; but of this I am sure that it is
      sincerely spoken and not in haste. I hardly know 
       how many years
      it is since I began to prepare it. Some four or five years ago I read a portion of
      it to a society of "Literary &amp; Scientific" persons (as they styled themselves)
      in Birkenhead, and succeeded in stimulating them to enquire for themselves about the
      brave poet of whom they had often heard but knew little. Again, last December, a
      more important society in Liverpool listened to what I had to say on the same
      subject. Part of what I told them is contained in the present article &amp; part in
      a pamphlet which I will send you later on, as soon 
       as I receive it.
      I may say that at this meeting I had the pleasure of hearing several warm admirers
      of yourself discuss my paper. Mr. E. R. Russell,<sup><a href="#loc.03216_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> the
      editor of the Liverpool <u>Post</u> and late M. P for Glasgow had
      some good &amp; wise words to say. Perhaps in its printed form my article may
      stimulate others to enquire. If so I shall be well satisfied.
   </p>

      (1834â€“1920) was a journalist who edited the <em>Islington
         Daily Gazette</em> and was in 1865 appointed editor of the <em>Liverpool Daily Post</em>, a position he held for fifty years. A Liberal
      and strong supporter of William Gladstone, Russell was a Member of Parliament
      (Glasgow) from 1885 to 1887. He wrote frequently about literature and the arts
      and was an active member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of
