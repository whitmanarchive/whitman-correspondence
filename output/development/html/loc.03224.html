      Walt Whitman is a poet who refused to be ground in
      the small mortar of human conventionality. Like Wagner in music, he thought he
      had a new idea, and resolutely, through a long life, impressed the individuality
      of that idea on the literature of the new world. It cannot be said that his
      poetry is good, but it may be maintained that he copied it nowhere. Whether he
      could write poetry or not, he deserved the thanks of all true Americans for
      dealing metrical form and ceremony the deadliest blow it has ever received. Such
      atrocities as Pope's translation of Homer would not be possible in the age of
      Walt Whitman.—<em>Chicago Herald.</em>
