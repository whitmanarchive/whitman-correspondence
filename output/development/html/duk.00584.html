   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00584_n11">1. This letter dates to
      September 28, 1871. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter September 30, 1869,
      and Edwin Haviland Miller cited Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:367). Bucke's and Miller's date, however, is incorrect. The
      letter dates to two years later, to a late-September 1871 visit to Brooklyn from
      the family of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's daughter Mary Van Nostrand. The Van
      Nostrands came to shop in anticipation of the approaching marriage of Mary's
      daughter Mary Isadore "Minnie" in October 1871. Louisa had indicated her anxiety
      regarding the expected visit in her  letter to Walt Whitman. A week after this letter,
      Louisa wrote that her "company is here yet and i dont know how long they will
      remain" (see her  letter to Walt
      Whitman). Based on this letter's consistency with the preceding and the
      following letters on the Van Nostrands' extended visit, this letter dates to the
      last Thursday of the month, September 28, 1871.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00584_n6">2. Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." The visit is in preparation for the marriage of Minnie to
      Leander Jay Young (1846–1937) on October 18, 1871 (see Gertrude A. Barber,
      compiler, "Marriages of Suffolk County, N.Y. Taken from the 'Republican
      Watchman': A Newspaper Published at Greenport, N.Y. Years 1871, 1872, 1873,
      1874, 1875, 1876" [1950], 1:3). For more on the Van Nostrand family, see Jerome
      M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George

   <p id="duk.00556_n3">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
