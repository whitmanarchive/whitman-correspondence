   <p>Your letter 
      recd. 
      The girls are with us yet and propose to return tomorrow/Friday. They
      visited Ausable
      Chasm, yesterday, weather not permitting sooner, and had a splendid perfect time,
      and were enchanted 
      more of which satisfaction, they will
      relate to you themselves.
   </p>
   
   <p>You mention Jessie's
      picture, why not Manahatta's, nothing short of the twain, will satisfy me. I am delighted
      with
      both, and have been
      cheered immensely by their visit: lovely good  girls, contrasts in complexion yet harmoniously uniting. Han is pretty well, and
      much
      gratified with your letter.
