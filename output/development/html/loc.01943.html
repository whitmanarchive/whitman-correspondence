       —I am the stranger who, passing, desires to speak to you. Once before I have
      done so, offering you a few feeble verses.<sup><a href="#loc.01943_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I do not
      wonder you did not reply to them. Now my voice is stronger, I ask, <u>why will</u> you not speak to me?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So fortunate as to be traveling in these very interesting islands I have done wonders
      in my intercourse with these natives.  For the first time I act as my nature prompts me. It would not
      answer in America, as a general principle, not even in California where men are
      tolerably bold. This is my mode of life:—At dusk I reach some village, a few grass
      huts by the sea or in some valley. The native villagers gather about me, for
      strangers are not common in these parts. I observe them closely. Superb looking,
      many of them. Fine heads. Glorious eyes that question, observe and then trust or
      distrust with an infallible instinct. Proud, defiant lips, a matchless physique,
      grace and freedom in every motion. I mark one, a lad of eighteen or twenty years who
      is regarding me. I call him to me, ask his name  giving mine in return. He speaks it over
      and over, manipulating my body unconsciously, as it were, with bountiful and
      unconstrained love. I go to his grass-house, eat with him his simple food, sleep
      with him upon his mats, and at night sometimes waken to find him watching me with
      earnest, patient looks, his arm over my breast and around me. In the morning he
      hates to have me go. I hate as much to leave him. Over and over I think of him as
      I
      travel: he doubtless recalls me some times, perhaps wishes me back with him. We were
      known to one another, perhaps twelve hours. Yet I cannot forget him. Any thing that
      pertains to him now interests me.

   <p>You will easily imagine, my dear sir, how delightful I find this life. I read your
      Poems with a new spirit, to understand them as few may be able to. And I wish more
      than ever that I might possess a few lines from your pen. I want your personal
      magnetism to quicken mine, how else shall I have it? Do write me a few lines for
      they will be of immense value to me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish it were possible to get your photograph. The small <u>Lithograph</u> I have of you is not wholly satisfactory. But I would not ask
      so much of you. Only a page with your name &amp; mine as you write it–Is this too
      much?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My address is San Francisco, Cal <em>Box 1005. P. O.</em> I shall
      immediately return there.
