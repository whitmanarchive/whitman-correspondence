      <br></br>St. Louis,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Sept. 8th 1868
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear George,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I mailed you yesterday draft on Jay Cooke &amp; Co. for $510<sup><a href="#loc.00451_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—which I presume has come to hand
   </p>
   
   <p>How soon will your house be done—Do you intend Mother shall move there and live for
      awhile?<sup><a href="#loc.00451_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—[these] are the two questions that are in my mind just now—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mattie has a bad cough and I have had several first class physicians to see her and
      they all unite in saying that a trip east for a few months would cure her<sup><a href="#loc.00451_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I have been very unfortunate in the selection of a house—and unfortunately have a
      lease of two years on it under very stringent papers too—It occurred to me that if
      Mother was not going to move I would try and get a furnished room in your neighborhood
      and send Mat and Jess on and if your new house was in the neighborhood of completion
      and you proposed to move in it I thought perhaps you could hire Mat a room in that.
   </p>
   
   <p>The house is damp and I cannot seem to bettr it. I have spent abt $125 on it trying to fix it. I'm in a pretty tight place and will have to "wiggle"
      out of it—I am looking just now for some sort of a boarding school to send Hat for
      a few months till I can see how the matter is going to turn out—. The doctors all
      unite in declaring that Mat has no disease of the lungs<sup><a href="#loc.00451_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—it is all in the bronchial tubes of the throat—of course it is going to be hard for
      us to break up just now—but I do not think it worth while to risk everything in trying
      to "stick" it out in a bad bargain—
   </p>
   
   <p>Give my love to Mother—tell her Mat has a letter written to her<sup><a href="#loc.00451_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> that I will mail in the morning—and write me in regard to questions asked
   </p>

      the house on Portland Avenue until May 1869, at which time Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman did move into it (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <em>Civil War
         Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, N.C.: Duke University
      Press, 1975], p. 29).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.00451_n4">4. Six weeks later, after
      consulting with Dr. A. D. Wilson, Walt Whitman wrote Jeff a detailed report of
      Mattie's health which indicated that the disease <em>had</em>
      reached one of the lungs. Nonetheless, Walt Whitman remarked, the doctor "thinks
      there is no imminent danger at all—thinks that the physician in St. Louis who
      advised a change from there here, couldn't have had any knowledge of Brooklyn
      climate...nevertheless thinks that the journey &amp; a temporary change will be
      very salutary" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1978],
      2:68).<a href="#r4">[back]
