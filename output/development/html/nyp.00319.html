      <br></br><br></br>Dear Nelly:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>About me, my ailments, no great difference. (A queer old doctor here—did I tell you?—sticks
      to it that, 
      although the trouble has taken the form of paralysis, &amp; instigated far back, the basic
      &amp; origin are of 
      <em>stomachic</em> nature—at any rate the derangement &amp; suffering <em>now</em> 
      are mostly gastric &amp; liver business—telling in distress of head)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I went over to PhilPhil: yesterday, &amp; had a nice, good, I may almost say <em>happy</em> afternoon, with dear Mrs. Lesley, 
      Kate Hillard, &amp; the two Miss Lesleys, daughters<sup><a href="#nyp.00319_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—us four, only, no men-critters but me—I was there some four hours, 
      filled with animated talk—we had dinner, very nice, a nice glass of wine—Mrs. L. a
      fine gentle, sweet-voiced, 
      handsome black-eyed New England woman, (of the Lyman family, daughter of Judge Lyman.)<sup><a href="#nyp.00319_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> With Miss H[illard], though the first meeting, I got along capitally—found her a
      jolly, hearty girl—evidently seen life &amp; folks, &amp; read lots—she talked much about
      the London literati, 
      &amp; the (I suppose I may say) <em>personal</em> friends of mine there, both men &amp; women, nearly all of whom she knew well, 
      giving me, among the rest, descriptions of <em>Personnel</em> that were new &amp; very interesting to me. She goes to Wash[ington] 
      to-morrow, to stay there (1734 I st.) a month—reads a series of twelve papers on English poets.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I made a short call on Hector Tyndale, 1021 Clinton st—he came down to see me, in the parlor—(I did not see Mrs. T.)—Hector did not seem
      much different, physically—had the tone, I thought, 
      of one who is <em>dreary</em> of life, to whom it is all an <em>ennui</em>, a settled morbidity—of course that was the worst. 
      I rec'd a letter from Marvin to-day—from Peter Doyle yesterday—snowing here as I write—the
      baby fine, 
      fat, bright today, but raising his voice lustily just this moment—You got my letter
      three days since?<sup><a href="#nyp.00319_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
