   <p>I feel very sad about dear old 
      Walts
      
       illness.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The two telegrams in the London "Daily News" are so alarming—I fear I shall
      never see him again; I've half a mind to start off now to Philadelphia.
   </p>
   
   <p>If you see Walt again in this world after receiving this letter, give him my
      love.
   </p>
   
   <p>Write to me as soon as you get this if it's only a few lines.</p>
   
   <p>Tell me about your own health, how much work are you doing every day. Can I be of
      use? I wish I could be of more comfort to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am coming to America about the <u>middle</u> of August.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope that you are not working just the same as you did last summer. You <u>must</u> remember what the doctors told you.
   </p>
   
   <p>It will not do for you to be ill again. I feel horribly anxious about your
      health!
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Let me know if you require anything. I hope it will not be very hot in America in
      August. What I recollect of it last year, was that it began to "let up" in August
      cool nights,
      and that sort of thing.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mrs. Pearsall<sup><a href="#n4979" id="r1">1</a></sup> has told me of a nice little studio
      in Chestnut street high up that is only about $75 a year, which would just suit me.
      My idea is to hire
      a studio &amp; one other room in Chestnut street, &amp; to get my meals out at different cheap
      restaurants I, dare say, I could get a meal for 25 cents, and in the colder weather
      I
      could cook my own breakfast or at any rate my tea on my studio stove? So I shall
      bring a few cooking utensils &amp; a few other things. I want to make drawings of street
      scenes in Philadelphia and during the <u>election</u> in November—and
      maybe, also, that I shall travel to other cities a little during the elections. It
      is possible, also, that I may get work to do in connection with [
      <span class="unclear">in?</span>]
      :—Cherry street Academy
      of Fine Arts, but of that I am not certain.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am getting on with my portrait of Mrs. Costelloe<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>; I reckon to finish it before I
      leave England, and to leave it behind all ready for next year's Govenor of Royal Academy.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>She is a light hearted fine lady, talks to me in a lively strain during the sitting,
      but she is so
      superficial, every time one dips the oar of conversation in, I seem to scrape the
      sandy bottom!!
      And would you believe, that Westminster is five good miles from our house and at 2
      O.C. she leaves me to get home as best I can, &amp; to get a lunch where I can; there
      is no <u>in</u>hospitality like that
      of a fine lady from Germantown, however, no one will know when they look at her blooming
      cheeks
      on my canvas that the artist painted it on an empty stomach; at least so my sister
      laughs, and says.
   </p>
   
   <p>The Smiths, who have just arrived from Philadelphia tell
      me that Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r3">3</a></sup> procured Walt a man nurse; which was just
      what the dear old fellow wanted, I was so glad to hear it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Of my two friends across the pond no one knows how much I think and feel &amp; how little
      I say. I haven't written to Walt yet since his illness for I thought he might be too
      ill to open my letter. I have just received your second letter dated June 14th<sup><a href="#loc.02203_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> as well as the former in wch you spoke of your great loss. I received the
      former a week or
      2 weeks ago. My dear
      friend, are you going through this hot summer without a servant?—and doing all the
      work yourself? Tell me; and tell me have you a return of any of your old ailments
      because the doctors will shake their heads if you have—you <u>must</u> be careful.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope that I shall be able to be some comfort to my friends during my visit to the
      States.
   </p>
   
   <p>I can't very well manage to write a [illegible] family letter this time as I want this to catch this afternoon's mail. Mrs.
      Costelloe's portrait is coming on, and I think that it will do me credit &amp; do think
      that I may see
      Walt yet in the flesh. I do rejoice in his recovery; Debbie gives very hopeful account
      of him, at wch I am so pleased.
   </p>
   
   <p>Answer my question Madam, do you want anything?</p>
   
   <p>It has been quit hot here: so hot that I lay awake all last night. I am so glad to
      hear that [
      <span class="unclear">Mr. S's?</span>]
      <sup><a href="#n0817" id="r5">5</a></sup> strawberries promise so well. We have had lots of rain.
      Where has Van gone?
   </p>
   
   <p>Grace<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r6">6</a></sup> is going to give a large party 75 people here
      next Saturday—week probably the day that you will receive this, between 8:30 and
      12:30 in the evening.

      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4979">1. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02189_n1">2. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="n0817">5. Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:

   <p id="n0890">6. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
