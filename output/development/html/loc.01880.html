      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was exceedingly pleased at receiving your recent letter, &amp; the photograph wh. followed it immediately afterwards. I admire the photograph very much; rather grudge
      its having the hat on &amp; so cutting one out of the full portraiture of your face, but
      have little doubt, allowing for this detail, it brings me very near your external
      aspect. May I be allowed to send you, as a very meagre requital, the enclosed likeness
      of myself.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I gave your letter, &amp; the second copy of your portrait, to the lady you refer to,
      &amp; need scarcely say how truly delighted she was. She has asked me to say that you
      
      
      
      
      cd. not have devised for her a more welcome pleasure, &amp; that she feels grateful to me
      for having sent to America the extracts from what she had written, since they have
      been a satisfaction to you. She also begs leave, with much deference, to offer a practical
      suggestion:—that if you see no reason against it, the new edition might be issued
      in 2 vols., lettered, not vols. 1 &amp; 2, but 1st series &amp; 2nd series, so that they cd. be priced &amp; sold separated when so desired. She adds: "This simple expedient wd., I think, overcome a serious difficulty. Those who are not able to receive aright
      all Mr. Whitman has written might, to their own infinite gain, have what they <u>can</u> receive, &amp; grow by means of that food to be capable of the whole perhaps; while he
      wd. stand as unflinchingly as hitherto by what he has written. I know I am glad that
      your selections were put into my hands first, so that I was lifted up by them to stand
      firm on higher ground than I had ever stood on before, &amp; furnished with a golden key
      before approaching the rest of the poems." She also, 
      
      
      
      as a hearty admirer of your original Preface, hopes that that may re-appear—either
      whole, or such portions as have not since been used in other forms.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I know, by a letter from O'Connor, that, since you wrote, you have seen the further
      observations of this lady wh. I sent over in Nov.—I replied to O'Connor the other day also, still more recently,
      took the liberty of posting to you a little essay of mine, written for one of our
      literary societies, on "Italian Courtesy books" of the Middle Ages. Some of the extracts
      I have translated in it may, I hope, be found not without their charm &amp; value. I wrote
      to Conway giving him your cordial message: probably you know that he was not long
      ago in Russia. Also I heard the other day from a man I am much attached to, Stillman,
      of his having re-encountered you in Washington. As he told you, there is a chance—not
      as yet <u>more</u> than a chance—that I may make my way over the Atlantic for a brief glimpse of America
      in the summer. If so, how great a delight it will be to me to see &amp; know 
      
      
      
      you need not, I hope, be stated in words.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Perhaps before that I shall have received here the new edition you refer to—another
      deep draught of satisfaction.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I cd run on a great deal further on these &amp; other topics; but shd have to come to a close at last somewhere, &amp; may perhaps as well do so now.</p>
