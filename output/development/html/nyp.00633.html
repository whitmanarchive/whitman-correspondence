   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00633_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Wm D O'Connor | 1015 O Street N W | Washington D C. It is postmarked: Camden (?)
      | Feb 19 | 8 PM | 89.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00633_n2">3. The <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em>'s notice of <em>November Boughs</em>
      (1888) was entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/boughs/anc.00124.html">The Gospel According to Walt Whitman</a>." It was published in the
      January 25, 1889, issue, and although unsigned in the original, the author of
      the notice was Irish poet and playwright, Oscar Wilde.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00633_n3">4. An unsigned review of <em>November Boughs</em> was published in the <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/boughs/anc.00125.html">January 26, 1889</a>, issue of <em>The London
         Echo</em>.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">5. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
