      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mrs. Bielby, &amp; Dear Doctor,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I read the letter of Oct. 29, (full of good kindliness &amp; sympathy—My general physique
      still 
      [ke]eps up, the battle with my [se]rious special cerebral ailment—&amp; I think the physique
      
      will yet carry the day—&amp; that I shall come back to Washington, &amp; see you all again—though
      my case is very fluctuating &amp; tantalizing. Doctor, should you come Philadelphiaward, don't 
      fail to come over (by ferry foot of Market st.) to see me. It is not more than ten
      minutes journey in 
      Camden—&amp; it will do me good. It is not more than half a mile on the Camden side—When
      
      I return to Washington we three must get better acquainted.
   </p>
