   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of July 17, from near Wiemar has just reached me. I am still here in Camden,
      &amp; shall probably remain permanently. <em>I do not recover my
         health</em>—for over two months past have been worse than ever, but feel better 
      to–day
      
      , as I write—(if it would only continue)—I have pretty much given up
      all prospect of going out again in the world, as an active worker—&amp; the best I
      look for is to keep up, by care &amp; moderation, &amp; have the use of my mind as so far,
      with the partial use of my physical powers, for whatever term of life I have yet to
      live. I
      still go out in the open air a little, talk, &amp; keep in good spirits. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just sent you a paper with a long piece in, that may give you more particulars
      about
      me.<sup><a href="#rlc.00013_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> Write often as you can—your English I get the
      meaning of very well, &amp; I am quite lonesome here. (All the letters you have ever
      sent—&amp; papers, sheets, &amp;c—<em>have quite certainly reach'd
         me</em>—I have a large bundle of them.) 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I write, I sit here by my open window—it is very pleasant, plenty of trees &amp;
      foliage, (though I live in a street, in a city) warm, but a slight rain, just now—I
      have been out, this forenoon, riding in a street car—&amp; to the printing office,
      where I am printing a little book, my War–Hospital <em>Memoranda</em> of
      ten &amp; twelve years since. When finished I will send it to you. Also "Two Rivulets,"
      you
      see mentioned in the paper. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your brief words about Wiemar, only made me want <em>more</em>.<sup><a href="#rlc.00013_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> Every thing now going on about literature or authors, or subjects
      appertaining to them, in the Old World, (Denmark included of course,) is more interesting
      to
      me than you might suppose. I have been in hopes of hearing from Elster<sup><a href="#n0216" id="r4">4</a></sup>.
      I wonder if he got the letter &amp; papers I sent him—If any <em>Dane
         you know</em> is coming to America, (if convenient,) <em>give him my address
         here in Camden</em>—(Philadelphia is on one side of the river Delaware, &amp; Camden
      immediately opposite on the other—ferries constantly running—I live near the
      river)—Good bye, my dear Rudolf Schmidt—write often as you can.<sup><a href="#rlc.00013_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0793">1. Rudolf Schmidt, a Dane and
      editor of <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em>, is credited with
      introducing Walt Whitman to Scandinavia by quoting translated passages from <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in a 1872 essay in his magazine. He wrote
      to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871:
      "I intend to write
      an article about yourself and your writings in the above named periodical which
      is very much read in all the Scandinavian countries. ... I therefore take the
      liberty to ask you, if you should not be willing to afford some new
      communications of yourself and your poetry to this purpose" (The Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00013_n1">2. On July 23, 1875, the Springfield <em>Republican</em> printed a three-column article entitled "Walt
      Whitman. | His Life, His Poetry, Himself." Though the article was signed with
      the initials J. M. S. (James Matlock Scovel), Burroughs observed on : "It is an admirable piece of writing
      (of course I see your hand) &amp; contains some of the best things about you
      that have yet been in print." The New York <em>Tribune</em>
      printed excerpts from the dispatch on July 24, 1875; William Michael Rossetti
      quoted from it in <em>The Academy</em>, 8 (August 14, 1875), 167;
      see <em>Letters of William Michael Rossetti</em>, ed. Gohdes and
      Baum (1934), 96–97; Scovel utilized most of the material in the <em>National Magazine</em>, 20 (1904), 165–169.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n0216">4. Kristian Elster (1841–1881) was a Norwegian
      novelist whose work focused on cultural conflict, as in his 1872 pamphlet "On
      the contrast between the western and the eastern parts of Norway." According to
      Carl Roos, Elster was a friend of Björnstjerne Björnson (1832–1910),
      Norwegian poet, dramatist, and novelist; see <em>Orbis
         Litterarum</em>, VII (1949), 51n.<a href="#r4">[back]
