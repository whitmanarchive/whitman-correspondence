   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="har.00041_n1">1. On February 13, Whitman
      sent a "postal to Dr Bucke ab't Longfellow's autograph," which Bucke had
      apparently requested (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.). On , Longfellow wrote to
      Whitman: "It gives me great pleasure to comply with your request"; and on
      February 24, Whitman sent the autograph to Bucke (Whitman's Commonplace Book).
      In 1891, Whitman recollected the incident in a conversation with Horace Traubel:
      "Bucke once got me in a hell of a hole. Wrote asking me to interpose for an
      autograph of Longfellow—wished it for some great lord somebody up
      there—a man he was under—a man whose favor he particularly
      wanted—indeed, he owned as much to me—and would have me write, which
      I did. And the gentle amiable sweet Longfellow acquiesced. But I was ashamed of
      myself—thousands of dollars would not have bought it. This thing with
      Forman [another request for an autograph] amounts to about the same. I do it but
      hate myself for surrendering" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 9 vols., 8:223–224).<a href="#r1">[back]
