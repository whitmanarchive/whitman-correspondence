   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00349_n2">1. This letter dates to May
      16, 1873. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman follows a
      letter on the same sheet of paper from Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman to Walt.
      Louisa Orr Haslam dated her letter "Friday." May 16, 1873, the date Richard
      Maurice Bucke assigned to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter, fell on
      Friday. Edwin Haviland Miller dated this letter "about" May 17, 1873 (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–75], 2:220, n. 85). Miller's date is incorrect
      because May 17 fell on Saturday in 1873.<br><br>
      In his letter of , Walt
      acknowledged his mother's 
      letter as the first one that he had received in several days. This letter
      must therefore follow Louisa's May 13 or 14, 1873 letter, and it cannot date
      to May 23, 1873, the next Friday and day of Louisa's death. Walt arrived at
      the home of his brother George Washington Whitman in Camden, New Jersey, on
      May 20, 1873 (see Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary
         Singer</em> [New York, Macmillan, 1955], 452).<br><br>
      This letter may be the final letter that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman sent to
      her son Walt. Another letter, which was probably written later, may not have
      been sent (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="tex.00349_n4">2. Walt Whitman in January 1873
      suffered a paralytic stroke that initially confined him to bed: it took weeks
      before he could resume walking. He first reported the stroke to his mother in
      his  letter and continued to
      report his condition in subsequent letters.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n3">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
