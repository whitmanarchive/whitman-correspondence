      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I will only write you a hasty note this time, as I am pretty tired, &amp; my head feels
      disagreeable, from being in too much—I was up yesterday to Carver hospital &amp; again
      saw the man of the 51st, Thos McCowell,<sup><a href="#loc.00828_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> who told me of George, up to latter part of Thursday, 12th inst. I questioned him, &amp; his story was very clear,
      so I felt perfectly satisfied—he is wounded in hand, will be transferred soon to New
      York &amp; may call on you—he is a young Irishman, &amp; seems to be a very good fellow indeed—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have written to George, day before yesterday. Did you send my last letter to Han?—if
      not send it yet—Mother, I see such awful things—I expect one of these days, if I live,
      I shall have awful thoughts &amp; dreams—but it is such a great thing to be able to do
      some real good, assuage these horrible pains &amp; wounds, &amp; save life even—that's the only
      thing that keeps a fellow up—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, dear mother, I make such reckoning of yet coming on &amp; seeing you—how I want
      to see Jeff too—O it is too bad I have not written to him so long—&amp; Mat too &amp; little
      California &amp; all—I am going out now a little while—I remain first rate &amp; well as ever—
   </p>
