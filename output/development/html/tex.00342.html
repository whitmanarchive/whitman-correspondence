      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Tenn[yson]<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n0625" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Since I last wrote you, (your kind response was duly 
      rec'd
      
      )<sup><a href="#tex.00342_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I have been laid up here nearly all the time, &amp;
      still continue so, quite shattered, but somehow with good spirits—not well enough
      to
      go out in the world &amp; go to work—but not sick enough to give up either, or lose my
      interest in affairs, life, literature, &amp;c. I keep up &amp; dressed, &amp; go out a
      little nearly every day. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been reading your Queen Mary,<sup><a href="#tex.00342_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; think you have
      excelled yourself in it. I did not know till I read it, how much eligibility to passion,
      character and art arousings was still left to me in my sickness &amp; old age. Though
      I am
      Democrat enough to realize the deep criticism of Jefferson on Walter Scott's<sup><a href="#n0546" id="r5">5</a></sup> writings, (&amp; many of the finest plays, poems &amp; romances) that
      they fail to give at all the life of the great mass of the people then &amp; there. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But I shall print a new volume before long, &amp; will send you a copy. I send you a paper
      about same mail with this.<sup><a href="#tex.00342_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Soon as convenient write me a few lines. (Put in your letter your exact 
      p.o.
      
       address.) If you have leisure, tell me about yourself. I shall never see you &amp;
      talk to you—so I hope you will write to make it up. 
   </p>

      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
