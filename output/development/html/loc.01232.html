      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
    
    
   
   
   
   <p>Many thanks for your two enclosures of printed extracts &amp;c. I wrote to Mr. Buchanan
      about his plan of forming a society for the circulation of your works, but he has
      not given me very definite information of what is intended;
      
      
      
      meanwhile for the time I have been absorbed by the news of the death of one of my
      brothers in India. This brings with it the additional pains to me that it [
      <span class="unclear">will?</span>]
       probably prevent my intended journey to the States this Summer. I had made all arrangements
      and was carried forward on the hope of seeing you, and now I am greatly disappointed.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I must ask instead that you will send me your two volumes when ready—two copies of
      each—I am anxious to see them. Please forward them as soon as you can to me at <u>45 Brunswick Square, Brighton</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I have got a P.O.O for £4 wh I enclose; I was trusting to what I think Robert Buchanan said that £1 was the price
      per vol., 
      
      
      but I do not feel sure this is right as $5 would be more than that. However you will
      let me know if there is any [
      <span class="unclear">excess?</span>]
       due to you &amp; I will forward the sum.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      It is difficult for us in England to know what is the truth among all the conflicting
      reports. I hope that the latest namely that you are not suffering from any immediate
      want is the right one, this I feel that you must often be under some pressure of difficulty.
      Of one thing 
      
      
      
      I am sure—from internal evidence so to speak—namely that your books have never been
      a source of profit to you‑tho' they may have been to others

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).
