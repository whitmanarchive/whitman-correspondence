   <p>Lots of inquiries &amp; prayers &amp; good wishes ab't you come to me (&amp; I hear of) that <em>you</em>
      never hear of. I rec'd Nelly's<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r2">2</a></sup> two brief cards over two weeks ago—but hunger for
      more frequent &amp; fuller information—Hear from Dr B[ucke]<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r4">4</a></sup> often &amp; from John

      an early proof of all to you—As I write I am sitting here in my big chair by the
      window (I have open'd it a few moments—it is near sunset—air a little tart)—I am
      quite <em>immobile</em> &amp; don't get out except by being <em>toted</em>—a bunch of white lilies is in

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00605_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd April 16/88." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | 1015 O Street |
      Washington | DC. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | Apr 12 | (?) | 88.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">2. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

      D. Kummings, ed. (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">4. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00480_n8">5. John Burroughs
      (1837–1921) met Walt Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864.
      After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a
      lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs wrote several books involving
      or devoted to Whitman's work: <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</em> (1867), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting
         the Universe</em> (1924). Ursula North (1836–1917) married John
      Burroughs in 1857 and also became a friend to Walt Whitman. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the Burroughs family, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John (1837–1921) and Ursula
         (1836–1917)</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4133">6. In late 1887, James Gordon Bennett,
      Jr., editor of the <em>New York Herald</em>, invited Whitman to
      contribute a series of poems and prose pieces for the paper. From December 1887
      through August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems appeared.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">7. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00605_n2">8. O'Connor responded on
      , with characteristic fervor to
      Walt Whitman's last sentence: "What an idyl of your room you opened to me in
      your flash of description—you in the big chair, the window open to the
      sunset, the Easter lilies on the sill, and the little bird singing his furious
      carol! It was quite divine. How I wish you could get active and well!" For
      Whitman's reaction to the letter when he discussed it with Traubel a year later,
      see Horace Traubel,<em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.74.html"> Thursday, April 4, 1889</a>.<a href="#r8">[back]
