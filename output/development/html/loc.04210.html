      <br></br><br></br>My Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We set foot on dry land again Wednesday morning after a good passage<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r1">1</a></sup>—not a very smooth one—and not without four or five days of seasickness, but after
      that we really enjoyed the sea &amp; the sky—it was mostly cloudy, but such lovely lights
      and shades &amp; invigorating breezes! and as we got up into northern latitudes, daylight
      in the sky all night through. The last three days we had glorious scenery—sailed close
      in under the Giant's Causeway on the north coast of Ireland—great sort of natural
      ramparts &amp; bastions or rock, wonderfully grand. Then we sailed on Lough Fozle to land
      a group of Irish folk at Moville—some of them old people who had not seen Ireland
      for forty years, and who were so happy they did not know what to do with themselves.
      And what with this human interest, and the first getting near land again and the rich
      green-and-golden gorse-covered hills &amp; the setting sun streaming along the beautiful
      lough with golden light, it was a sight &amp; a time I shall never forget. Then we entered
      the Firth of Clyde &amp; sailed among the islands—mountainous Arran, level Bute—&amp; on the
      other hand the green hills of Ayr, with pleasant towns nestled under them, sloping
      to the Clyde—this was during the night—we did not go to bed at all it was so beautiful—&amp;
      then came a gorgeous sunrise—&amp; then the landing at Greenock &amp; a short railway journey
      to Glasgow, the tide not serving to bring our big ship up so far. We had very pleasant
      (&amp; learned withal) companions on the voyage—the Professor of Greek &amp; of Philosophy
      from Harvard and a young student from Concord, all of whom we have seen since we landed
      and hope to see often again, especially the young student, Frank Bigelow, who is a
      very nice fellow. Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> enjoyed the voyage much &amp; so did Giddy.<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r3">3</a></sup> Glasgow is a great, solidly built city, very pleasant [in] spite of smoky atmosphere—full
      of sturdy, rosy-cheeked people with broad Scotch accent. We have been rushing about
      shopping—have not yet seen Per.—shall meet him at Durham in a week's time &amp; spend
      a month together there where he will be superintending your works. Meanwhile we are
      going to Edinburgh for a few days. I kept thinking of you on the voyage, dear friend,
      &amp; wondering how you would like it–&amp; whether you could stand being stowed away in the
      little box-like berth at night. I should recommend any American friend coming over
      to try this line–we had a fine ship–fine officers &amp; crew–&amp; the latter part, fine scenery.
      Love to your Brother &amp; Sister &amp; to Mr. Burroughs.<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r4">4</a></sup> Address to me for the present.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0259">1. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">2. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0890">3. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">4. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n2000">5. Percy Carlyle Gilchrist
      (1851–1935) was a British chemist and metallurgist, and the son of
      Alexander and Anne Gilchrist. Along with his cousin, Sidney Gilchrist Thomas, he
      developed the Thomas-Gilchrist process of producing steel from phosphoric pig
      iron during the late 1870s. See Marion Walker Alcaro, <em>Walt
         Whitman's Mrs. G: A Biography of Anne Gilchrist</em> (Cranbury, N.J.:
      Associated University Presses, 1991), 252 n28.<a href="#r5">[back]
