      home he arrived home last week Wednesday very much exhausted &amp; he was obliged to take
      to his bed from which he has not yet got up. he has put off writing every day thinking
      the next day he would be able to write himself. He often speaks of you telling of
      your kindness during his sickness there, and wishes he could see you and tried to
      gratify himself by looking at your portraits which he has out 5 or 6 times during
      the day. the sister whom you have heard him speak of as being sick so long was carried
      to the Insane Hospital the day before his arrival. he is very anxious to hear from
      you &amp; wants you should write him a good long letter to cheer him up for he has had
      the blues once since he came home.<sup><a href="#nyp.00143_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00143_n100">1. As Whitman informed Mrs.
      Curtis in a , Caleb Babbitt
      suffered a sun stroke in July and was admitted to Armory Square Hospital.
      According to the "Hospital Note Book" (Henry E. Huntington Library), Babbitt had
      been in Mobile, Alabama, earlier. About August 1, 1863, he left Washington on
      furlough. In this letter, Caleb's sister, Mary A. Babbitt informed Whitman of
      Caleb's arrival in Barre, Massachusetts; because of his exhaustion he was unable
      to write. Mary acknowledged Whitman's letter on , and wrote that Caleb was "not quite as well as
      when I wrote you before…he wishes me to tell you to keep writing…for your
      letters do him more good than a great deal of medicine." On , at the expiration of his
      forty-day furlough, Caleb was strong enough to write: "Walt—In your letters you
      wish me to imagine you talking with me when I read them, well I do, and it does
      very well to think about, but it is nothing compared with the original." On , Babbitt was depressed—"dark
      clouds seem to be lying in my pathway and I can not remove them nor hide them
      from my mind"—until he mentioned his beloved, Nellie F. Clark, who "has saved
      me." On , S. H. Childs wrote for
      Caleb from the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston: "He Is unable to set up
      &amp; suffers considerable pain In his
      head."
