      Dear Mr. Whitman
      
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>
      I think it must have been my guardian angel that gave thee the "impalpable nudge"
      to write to me. Thy card has 
      come<sup><a href="#loc.01390_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>  to cheer me just at a time when I am feeling unusually low in spirits &amp; discouraged.
      I have been quite ill all
      summer—"over-work," "nervous prostration," the rest—&amp; in
      
      spite of many weeks of tedious "absolute rest," I am worse &amp; not better, &amp; now I have
      to go off for I don't know
      how long to the Pyrennees, leaving my husband<sup><a href="#n6114" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; the two little ones<sup><a href="#loc.01390_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> in England. I start tomorrow. The one bright
      spot is that mother is going with me. But thy letter has really cheered me—it reminds
      me that absence is not the
      end of everything
      
      &amp; it sings, without the definite words, the "Song of the Open Road." My road has seemed
      so shut up—I am laid 
      adside in the midst of all the work I care for—fit for nothing—and Oh! the horror
      of feeling one's
      <u>mind</u>, as well as one's physical powers, under an eclipse. I have not been able to read
      
      a study or write or do anything I cared
      
      to all summer long. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      But thy remembrance reminds me not to complain, &amp; thy example encourages me to keep
      sound in spirits—"which 
      is the main thing." Thank thee for writing.  
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I will write from the Pyrennees in a few days—&amp; I hope I shall not be so egotistic
      &amp; gloomy. I am sure
      thee will have seen Alys<sup><a href="#n7014" id="r4">4</a></sup> by this time &amp;that she will have told thee all our news. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      
      Gratefully &amp; lovingly, 
      
      <br></br>Mary Costelloe.

   <p id="loc.01390_n2">3. Rachel Pearsall Conn
      Costelloe (1887–1940) was Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe's first daughter.
      Rachel ("Ray") was a writer and women's suffrage activist who ran for a seat in
      the British parliament soon after women were granted the right to vote. She
      eventually married Oliver Strachey (brother of biographer Lytton Strachey).
      Karin Stephen (née Catherine Elizabeth Costelloe) (1889–1953) was
      Mary's second daughter. She would become a British psychoanalyst and
      psychologist, and the wife of Adrian Stephen (psychoanalyst and prominent member of
      the 
      Bloomsbury Group, and brother of Virginia Woolf).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n7014">4. Alyssa Whitall "Alys" Pearsall
      Smith (1867–1951) was born in Philadelphia and became a Quaker relief
      organizer. She attended Bryn Mawr College and was a graduate of the class of
      1890. She and her family lived in Britain for two years during her childhood and
      again beginning in 1888. She married the philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1894;
      the couple later separated, and they divorced in 1921. Smith also served as the
      chair of a society committee that set up the "Mothers and Babies Welcome" (the
      St Pancras School for Mothers) in London in 1907; this health center, dedicated
      to reducing the infant mortality rate, provided a range of medical and
      educational services for women. Smith was the daughter of Robert Pearsall and
      Hannah Whitall Smith, and she was the sister of Mary Whitall Smith
      (1864–1945), the political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend."<a href="#r4">[back]
