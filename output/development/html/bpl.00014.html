   <p>of 13 req. I shall at once [illegible] get
      over to Baxter.<sup><a href="#n6000" id="r1">1</a></sup> Think [illegible] &amp; [

      — [

       of
      the fund than Baxter or I. But he [
      <span class="unclear">might?</span>]
       well be. All he has is the [illegible] paper of promises &amp; ten
      dollars or so in cash. [
      <span class="unclear">Baxter?</span>]
       has 
      abt
      
       $200 or over in cash. I [illegible] will advise him to collect and send on the whole amount as
      soon as he possibly can. It 
      wd
      
       be a good [
      <span class="unclear">idea?</span>]
       perhaps for him to send on now what he has [illegible] on. I am sure we shall all be
      [
      <span class="unclear">quite?</span>]
      
      satisfied with 
      yr
      
       plans, for my part I am [illegible] pleased that you are going to [illegible]
      [illegible] the matter &amp; take it with 
      yr
      
       own hands for [illegible] how
      vital a matter it is to you. [
      <span class="unclear">There?</span>]
       is only one drawback [
      <span class="unclear">with me?</span>]
      , however, and
      [
      <span class="unclear">it is?</span>]
       that my
      excuse for writing you is gone. [illegible] had cunningly arranged that my contribution [illegible] be my expenses to Camden &amp; board bills [illegible] be there helping you get
      domicilled. I was going [illegible]
      actually hammer &amp; saw if necessary. I built my own study out in Ohio
      [
      <span class="unclear">where a lady used to
         own?</span>]
      
      [
      <span class="unclear">As?</span>]
       you will not be
      unwilling to see me [illegible]
      [illegible] though you don't write
      [
      <span class="unclear">me to?</span>]
       ever
      come. [illegible] I thought you might be
      bored with so many visitors as you probably are. By the way, please [illegible] for [illegible] invitation to the Gilchrist [illegible] see [illegible] here. I feel [
      <span class="unclear">very sorry?</span>]

   <p>Dear SB—I just send Kennedy's<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r3">3</a></sup> letter &amp; write on it
      what suggests to me impromptu—Yes I am making calculation on a

      either in the woods or in sight of the sea, where I can haul in &amp; breathe a
      sane atmosphere &amp; be secure like either for the summers or all the time yet

      O'Reilly's K's &amp; your hands (&amp; any others if any others there be)
      putting it in a draught payable to my order &amp; send it to me here—I
      feel as if I could suit m wants &amp; tastes better probably deciding &amp;
      directing the practicality of the whole thing <u>myself</u>—(I am sure you will all understand it.) Show this to Mrs. F
      and O'R—I wish them to know too how appreciatingly &amp; gratefully I feel 
      abt

   <p id="n6000">1. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="n4973">2. John Boyle O'Reilly
      (1844–1890) was a fervent Irish patriot who joined the British Army in
      order to sabotage it. He was arrested and sentenced to be hanged in 1866. Later
      the decree was altered, and O'Reilly was sent to Australia, where he escaped on
      an American whaler in 1869. In 1876 he became the coeditor of the Boston <em>Pilot</em>, a position which he held until his death in 1890.

         Boyle O'Reilly</em> (New York: Kennedy, 1956). For more on O'Reilly, see
