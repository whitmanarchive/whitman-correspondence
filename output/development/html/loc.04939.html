   <p>O death I cover you over with roses and early 
      lilies<br>But mostly and more the lilac that blooms the
      first<br>Copius I break, I break the sprigs from the
      bushes.<br>with loaded arms I come, pouring for you<br>For you and this Coffins all of you O death.<br>Sea–winds blown from East and West<br>Blown from the Eastern Sea and blown
      from, the Western Sea, till there on the
      prairies meeting.<br>These and with these I'll perfume the grave
      of him I love<br>O what shall I hang on the chamber wall?:<br>And what shall the pictures be I hang
      on the walls,<br>To adorn the burial house of him I love,<br>O light and free and tender!<br>O wild and loose to my soul—O wonderous
      singer. You only I hear, yet this star
      holds me, (but will soon depart)<br>Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me.<br>Sing on dearest brother<br>warble your reedy song.<br>Loud human song, with voice of utter–most
      woe,<br>Limitless out of the dusk out of the
      
      ceders
      
      
      and pines.<sup><a href="#loc.o4939_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>

      This moment yearning and thoughtful I turn back and think of that old man whom I met
      but once only for a few
      minutes, His books read and absorbed in part, his life, a part of it read of asking
      about of men [
      <span class="unclear">loungers?</span>]
      
      about the ferry houses, looking for a glimpse of his face at the little former house
      yet never seeing him, wondering eager
      over the news since first I saw or heard it, now learning to love the man The book
      and the author. I have two photographs,
      one in book, the other lately taken, within ten years. I look at the engraving in
      Leaves of Grass, at the gray in the beard
      at the features all absorbing and always wondering "if only he could know" everything
      is all light , transparent as light,
      yet all dark and moody and tearful,I would prize above all earthly things to see you
      and loaf awhile and ask you so much
      and so many things.I think what I wonder now if you still are the same lover of God and man
      unconventionally as is portrayed in Leaves of Grass.

      I read not long ago in the Century a line "the vagaries of my life"<sup><a href="#loc.04939_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> This troubled me. is the book and its plan and purpose a vagary.
      All the teaching of the native inherent immortality of the soul, is this a
      vagary. The Hebrew Scriptures declare so, the New Testament writings declare so. "If
      you love me, keep my commandments." If you care for me read my book. 
      I am sorry that the People do not understand, but as yet, the people of the States
      have not arisen, wait for the fusion of men
      nationalities and the type shall come forth. I hear much talk of the Lord's coming,
      but all things center on on this our globe.
      I cannot understand much of these things, only of my love and affection this I am
      sure of. May I call my self a pupil—Dear old man you are beloved more
      than you can know this is the best I have and you have it. I see you there and my
      hearts love goes out to you to night across
      seas and continents, now three score years and ten and soon to be yours, if only America
      would listen and the young men and young women could see that ideal life:
      To time, this is your book's dedication[illegible]
