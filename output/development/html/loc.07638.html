      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have your card of 17<u>th</u> Have also had a letter from Mrs O'Connor<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r1">1</a></sup> telling me 
      about O'C<u>s</u><sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> Exodus to the west. I have just written to her and to O C.  It seems 
      O'C.<u>s</u> doctors are at present telling Mrs O'C. that the disease is <u>now</u> 
      Scleroris the disease has been Sclerosis <u>all along</u> and how 
      the doctors could have thought otherwise (if they <u>did</u> so think) 
      I cannot imagine.  It is pitiable to see the hon 
      fellow at this late hour going for "change of air" as if that could by any possibility
      do 
      any good in such a case.  However it won't do any harm and the change may nurse him
      up a little 
      for the time.  He may go on living for months (even quite a few years) yet and the
      
      best thing of course is to save 
      him all the suffering 
      (mental &amp; bodily) possible.  All quiet here—country all frozen solid again—
      spenldid wheeling smooth hard roads—cloudy weather—all well here we have just 
      had a good dinner— roast turkey, bread sauce &amp; apple pie — what more could
      we ask for?  We are all looking forward to seeing you here by &amp; by—if the lecture
      comes off Mrs B.<sup><a href="#n4273" id="r3">3</a></sup> will go with me to New York after you and surely we can bring you home 
      comfortably between us—I have just written to Johnston<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r4">4</a></sup> too about the lecture want 
      to find out what they are thinking about in New York I guess it will be all right—they
      surely will not let the chance go by after Phil<u>a</u> setting them such a good example last year—I 
      wonder when they are going to print your hospital article in the Century?
   </p>

      Goodly—we all send love to you

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy and Richard
      Maurice Bucke were two of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Kennedy
      (1850–1929) first met Whitman while on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> in 1880. He became a fierce defender of Whitman
      and would go on to write a book-length study of the poet. For more about
      Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian physician,
      was Whitman's first biographer, and would later become one of his medical
      advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of Bucke and
      Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4137">1. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      grew up in Mooretown, Upper Canada. She was the daughter of William Gurd, an

      had eight children.<a href="#r3">[back]
