   <p>I have received the letter asking me to write for the "Broadway". 
      I do not write much, but your invitation is cordially appreciated, 
      and may serve as the spur toward something. I can at present only 
      briefly say that should I be able to prepare an article, or poem, 
      appropriate for the purposes of the magazine, 
      I will send it on—&amp; that I shall surely try to do so.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My address is at the Attorney General's office here. 
      (New York house, please forward this to Mr. Edmund Routledge, London.)

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Routledge &amp; Sons were the publishers of
      the London <em>Broadway Annual</em> (1867–1872). In 1867
      they printed two sympathetic accounts of Walt Whitman. American novelist W.
      Clark Russell termed Whitman one of America's eminent poets, and Robert Buchanan
      devoted an entire article to Walt Whitman; see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:45, 188–195. On
      December 28, 1867, the New York office of the firm requested that Whitman
      contribute "one or two papers or poems" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1996],
      1:263). Whitman sent "Whispers of Heavenly Death" in February 1868 and received
      $50 in compensation, which he accepted in his , letter to Routledge &amp; Sons. The poem, however, did not
      appear in the <em>Broadway Annual</em> until October 1868.
