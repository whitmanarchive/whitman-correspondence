   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00437_n14">1. "June 3" is in Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's hand, and the letter closes with the remark that Louisa writes
      on Saturday. June 3 fell on Saturday in 1865. Therefore, the letter dates to
      June 3, 1865. Richard Maurice Bucke also assigned the year 1865, and the year is
      consistent with the recent assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Edwin
      Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence, 1842–67</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:376).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">2. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00437_n11">3. Part of the Portland Avenue
      house was rented to the family of John Brown, a tailor (see Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). The relationship between the Browns and the Whitmans was often
      strained, especially in regard to the noise made by Jeff and Mattie's daughter
      "Hattie," but the Browns remained in the Portland Avenue house for five years.
      See Jeff's  and  letters to Walt.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00437_n10">4. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Walter Whitman, Sr., and
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. She resided in Burlington, Vermont, with her husband
      Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. The relationship
      between Hannah and Charles was difficult and marred with quarrels and disease.
      Charles was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor
      treatment of Hannah. Louisa wrote, "if heyde was kind to her she would get well"
      (see her  letter to
      Walt).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00437_n2">5. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      likely refers to George Washington Whitman's  letter. George (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the
      end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg
      (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove
      (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and later a mason named
      French. He would later be employed as an inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and
      Camden. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00437_n5">6. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman earnestly requested that Walt Whitman send a letter to the "children of
      the people that sent you money last winter." Jeff listed the families by their
      surnames—"Durkee's, Crany, Lanes &amp;c &amp;c" (see Jeff's  letter to Walt Whitman). The names in
      Jeff's letter match the postscript to Walt Whitman's "The Great Washington
      Hospitals: Life Among Fifty Thousand Sick Soldiers.—Cases of Brooklyn Men"
      (<em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, March 19, 1863, 2).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00437_n3">7. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. He later
      designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city
      engineer.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00437_n4">8. Edward B. Grayson was the
      husband of Juliet Grayson, who took boarders at 468 M Street South, where Walt
      Whitman lived between late January 1865 and at least June 1866. The Graysons
      were Southern sympathizers with a son in the Confederate Army.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00437_n6">9. Eight suspected conspirators
      in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln first appeared before a military
      tribunal on May 1, 1865. After a seven-week trial, all eight were found guilty
      on June 30, 1865; four were hanged on July 7, 1865, one died in prison in 1867,
      and three were pardoned in 1869.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00437_n8">10. Jefferson Davis
      (1808–1889) was the President of the Confederate States of America from
      1861 to 1865. After the Civil War, public opinion of Davis was mixed in both the
      North and the South.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00437_n12">11. Walt Whitman had inquired
      "whether you got the package of 5 Drum-Taps" (see his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman). Walt had directed
      printer Peter Eckler to deliver materials to his mother at the Portland Avenue
      address (see his  letter to Eckler).
      For details on the printing history and organization of <em>Drum-Taps</em>, see Ted Genoways, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00297.pdf">The
         Disorder of <em>Drum-Taps</em></a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 24 (Fall 2006/Winter 2007),
      98–116.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">12. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00437_n13">13. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Thomas Jefferson Whitman and his wife. Late in life, Ruggles
      lost interest in his practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures
      called "Ruggles Gems."<a href="#r13">[back]
