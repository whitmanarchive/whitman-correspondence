      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman
      <br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just picked out of my "pocket Coleridge" your letter of a year ago, published
      in the papers and which I cut out when I was living in New York.<sup><a href="#loc.01086_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I looked it up the other day to see if your birthday was
      the 30th of May, for I would please myself with the idea that when the ephemera of
      the ruthless old camp life was gone out of present view—when we are no longer
      "crowd the mournery" of this generation, and they are all "gone and done joined"
      with their dead—I should be glad to realize the substitution for the
      forgotten, the name of that one which alone would deserve the national festival
      &amp; sacrifice—the immemorial feast of the bards—the May Morris<sup><a href="#loc.01086_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Baal-Tinne<sup><a href="#loc.01086_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> as our
      commemoration of the Poet of the Leaves of Grass. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Today, on receiving a request from the West for a copy of your poems, I looked up
      the
      letter to get your address. It seems to me also that the manner of the request might
      please you, so I sent a sheet from the letter. It indicates the edition you "intend
      to <u>stand by</u>—with some indication also that there are
      those who will <u>stand</u>
      <u>with</u>
      <u>you</u>, in the most sanctified recesses of our best
      households—without "expurgation." 
   </p>
   
   <p>I have my self the same thin green covered quarto,<sup><a href="#loc.01086_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> your
      own edition—which you gave me personally not long after its first appearance.
      I came to meet you by request of a very manly friend, Sinclair Toussey,<sup><a href="#loc.01086_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> at his news stand (the great American News Co of today)
      then behind the Herald office in Nassau street, where my old master Bennett<sup><a href="#loc.01086_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> founded the independent press on the head of an empty
      barrel. I met you with momentary embarrassment and incredulity—but a few
      moments 
   </p>
   [illegible]
   
   
   <p>My sister learnt to read and understand you about as soon as I did and it has been
      a
      sort of propaganda with both of us to give away all the copies of your books we
      could get, to those whom we thought would appreciate their priceless worth, as the
      gospel of pure and sober joy serene. 
   </p>
   
   <p>You will not remember me by name, although I enjoyed your friendly
      consideration— before the war—I have pound [
      <span class="unclear">vast?</span>]
       volumes of type matter on the people of
      these states since, and led them and their leaders about like bee-swarms with noise
      of cowbells or other clatter. I want a little repose and came here to the Friendly
      City. Some go to Europe, but these states are good enough for me—especially
      the "friendly city." I have what is called success; made a good swath of greenback
      fodder to leave to my two children. Have ten or fifteen years of better work in
      me yet with good health &amp; clearer brain &amp; spirits than ever. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I send you $10.00 for the copy to send west, of your poems—and my photograph
      too if you recollect me.
