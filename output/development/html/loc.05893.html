   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05893_n1">1. Traubel founded <em>The Conservator</em> in March 1890, and he remained its editor
      and publisher until his death in 1919. Traubel conceived <em>The
         Conservator</em> as a liberal periodical influenced by Whitman's poetic and
      political ethos. A fair portion of its contents were devoted to Whitman
      appreciation and the conservation of the poet's literary and personal
      reputation.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n4973">2. John Boyle O'Reilly
      (1844–1890) was a fervent Irish patriot who joined the British Army in
      order to sabotage it. He was arrested and sentenced to be hanged in 1866. Later
      the decree was altered, and O'Reilly was sent to Australia, where he escaped on
      an American whaler in 1869. In 1876 he became the coeditor of the Boston <em>Pilot</em>, a position which he held until his death in 1890.
      See William G. Schofield, <em>Seek for a Hero: The Story of John
         Boyle O'Reilly</em> (New York: Kennedy, 1956). For more on O'Reilly, see
