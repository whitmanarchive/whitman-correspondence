   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00471_n9">1. This letter dates to June 7,
      1866. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "June 7 thursday" in her own
      hand, and June 7 fell on Thursday in 1866. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the
      letter to the year 1866, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date
      (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 1:377). The subjects of the letter are
      consistent with Louisa's residence at the Pacific Street house with Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. Furthermore, Walt
      Whitman addressed numerous matters from this letter in his  reply to Louisa: the improvement of
      the pain in his head, his invitation for Jeff to visit him in Washington, and
      the expectation that his brother "George will do well, in the houses, if he
      &amp; others put them up on Portland av."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00465_n9">2. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">3. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">4. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00471_n13">5. Joseph Phineas Davis's "mr
      somebody" who stays all night is never named in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      letters. But her terms "somebody" and "some one" are euphemisms for a companion
      with whom one has a romantic interest. She also refers to George Washington
      Whitman's interest in a young woman (almost certainly his future wife Louisa Orr
      Haslam) as being "carried away by somebody" (see her  letter to Walt).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00471_n5">6. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Walter Whitman, Sr., and
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. She resided in Burlington, Vermont, with her husband
      Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. The relationship
      between Hannah and Charles was difficult and marred with quarrels and disease.
      Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor
      treatment of Hannah. Louisa wrote, "if heyde was kind to her she would get well"
      (see her  letter to
      Walt).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">7. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00471_n7">8. George Washington Whitman
      married Louisa Orr Haslam (d. 1892), called "Loo" or "Lou," in spring
      1871.<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="duk.00471_n1">9. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      postscript appears in the top margin of the first page and is inverted. Walt
      Whitman replied on  that his health
      had improved: "it is very healthy here this summer—I havn't been troubled
      by the heat yet—my head is much better."<a href="#r9">[back]
