   <p>Yours 
      rec'd
      
       and very opportunely<sup><a href="#med.00638_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—all today has been
      the dismalest of this grim winter here, furious snow and wind howling, and I have
      not stirred out—the roads and rivers here all 
      block'd
      
       with snow and ice—the last week my physical system 
      block'd, too, with a chill and depression—right in the middle of the
      smoothest sailing I have had for years—but I feel that it will be a passing
      cloud (such indeed as comes to me every two or three months)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yes I am quite tickled and favorable to coming there and am about sure I shall come,
      accepting your good invitation right out—Will write again this week—I
      have one or two newspaper bits about the <em>Review</em> article which
      I will send you;<sup><a href="#med.00638_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> it has been extracted from
      considerable—the best thing is a letter from the <em>Review</em>
      editor, Allen Thorndike Rice, to me about a week after the piece appeared, one of
      the most eulogistic, solid acceptances of my theories possible<sup><a href="#med.00638_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—he paid me $100 for the piece and supplied me
      with a hundred pamphlet copies of it. I have 
      rec'd
      
       five or six letters from one and another, none of any 
      acc't. I saw Marvin some weeks ago.<sup><a href="#med.00638_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> Eldridge is in
      Boston, in U.S. office. Dr. Bucke is writing his book.<sup><a href="#med.00638_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>
