   Carpenter.
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">Admirers of Edward Carpenter will be interested in the
      following letter written to THE HERALD by Caroline K.
      Sherman:
   </p> 
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">Among the many attempts to solve the social and
      economic problems which at the present time engage the minds of all thoughtful
      persons that of the Englishman, Edward Carpenter, is one of the most interesting
      and, perhaps, one of the most reasonable. Mr. Carpenter saw the innumerable
      difficulties that lie in the way of a satisfactory adjustment of the present
      order, or disorder, of things, and yet, firmly believing that such an adjustment
      was not impossible, he set to work, not so much to put forward some new theory
      of the conduct of life, which others ought to follow, as to realize practically
      in his own life the conditions essential to this better adjustment. He had
      graduated at Cambridge with distinguished honor, and although his studies had
      been mainly in the direction of mathematics and science, ethics and humanitarian
      interests generally occupied no small share of his attention. He was at this
      time decidedly conventional—his fortune, social standing and college
      education favoring the more conservative views of life. For a time he was
      engaged as university extension lecturer, giving to the masses in the larger
      towns the information, in a somewhat diluted form, which was furnished at the
      universities. During his engagement as extension lecturer he came across the
      writings of Walt Whitman, which, strange to say, made the turning point of his
      life. He began to question conventionalities and to weigh and estimate customary
      forms, and while he did not underrate their possible value, his disposition was
      to ignore them unless they were the worthy expressions of a genuine spirit. This
      naturally led him to a closer sympathy with humanity and to the belief that
      there might be a truer meaning of the word "equality" than is given in legal
      vocabluaries and a broader and more determined sense of justice than is found in
      the courts of equity. He saw, too, that there were indications here and there in
      all classes of a deeper feeling of human solidarity and genuine brotherliness,
      which might in time, if it became at all general, lead to a better order of
      society. This insight, however, did not lead Mr. Carpenter into the fatal
      mistake of supposing that a millennium can be had for the asking, or that a
      better condition of things can be brought about simply by passing a law
      commanding it. He knew well that before changing laws it is necessary first to
      change the aims and ideals of men, and that this cannot be effected by any
      sudden or violent process. In his own unaffected English he says:
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">"A change of society without change of heart amounts
      to nothing. If it is to be a substantial movement it must mean a changed ideal,
      a changed conception of daily life. These things first, and a larger share of
      the pudding afterward."
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">The change to which Mr. Carpenter refers is greater
      simplicity of living, courage of one's own convictions, needful charity of the
      faults and failings of others, and that spirit of helpfulness to the weak which
      enables them to help themselves. And he adds:
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">"If you have such a new ideal within you it is your
      clearest duty, as well as your best interest, to act it out in your own life at
      all apparent cost."
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">As to his own efforts in this direction Mr. Carpenter
      tells us:
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">"I began to wonder if the most sensible and obvious
      thing for me to do were not to just try and keep at least one little spot of
      earth clean, actually to try and produce clean, unadulterated food, to encourage
      honest work, to cultivate decent and healthful conditions for the workers and
      useful products for the public, and to maintain this state of affairs as long as
      I was able, taking the chance of the pecuniary results to myself. It would not
      be much, but it would be something. Just a little glimmer, as it were, in the
      darkness, but if others did the same the illuminations would increase and after
      a time we would be able to act our way better."
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">In accordance with this purpose Mr. Carpenter bought a
      little place of a dozen acres, erected a very simple cottage, and commenced
      raising vegetables for market, going to market himself with his pony and cart
      and selling his own produce. In this way he makes his living, benefiting at the
      same time those who choose to buy of him, since he is bent on being
      straightforward in all his dealings, and never palms off an inferior article as
      better than it actually is. In his dress he is simple and unaffected, wearing
      the flannel shirt and soft hat so becoming to the tourist. He chooses to wear
      sandals rather than boots, merely because they offer greater freedom of motion.
      This simple and altogether natural mode of life affords ample opportunity for
      thought and study, which is almost impossible to be found in luxurious
      households, where the care and anxiety in regulating as well as maintaining the
      establishment absorb most of the comfort and the greater part of the time. In
      many respects Mr. Carpenter is not unlike our own Thoreau—in his desire
      for a life that has some higher significance than meaningless conventionalities,
      in his purpose to realize practically what appears to him the most rational mode
      of life, making animal and sensuous wants subordinate to the higher intellectual
      and spiritual needs. He is like Thoreau, also, in that he is no professed
      philanthropist or propagandist, but resolutely follows his own bent, believing
      that to be the best course for himself. If others see a better way, let them
      pursue that. There is, however, this difference between the two men: Thoreau was
      disposed to be indifferent, not only to the common courtesies of life, but even
      to the real interests of humanity. It shocks us that he could write, as he did,
      in the memorable spring of '61, when the country was on the eve of its great
      civil war: "I do not so much regret the present condition of things in this
      country as I do that I ever heard of it. Blessed are they who never read a
      newspaper, for they shall see Nature, and through her, God." Mr. Carpenter, on
      the contrary, is keenly alive to anything pertaining to the real well-being of
      humanity, and watches with interest all honest efforts that tend to its
      advancement.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">The little cottage in which Mr. Carpenter chooses to
      live is large in its hospitalities. Its unpretentious rooms are open to persons
      of widely different stations in life, for its owner will tolerate no artificial
      distinction. Here he has written a series of essays giving his own views of life
      and what to him makes life most desirable. These essays are widely known and
      appreciated in England, and have recently appeared in book form under the title
      of "England's Ideal." He has also written a volume of poems, somewhat
      Whitmanesque in style, for it is a curious fact that while Walt Whitman is read
      but little in America, and appreciated still less, he is read quite extensively
      in England, and the influence of his style as well as his thought is perceptible
      on many of the younger English writers. Whatever varying opinions there may be
      as to the peculiar views of men like Thoreau, Tolstoi, Edward Carpenter and
      others who advocate simpler modes of living as the essential requisite to the
      higher and more rational forms of happiness, there can be but one opinion as to
      the value of men like these, whose integrity of purpose and honest endeavor go
      far toward making even the humblest life desirable, and without which the most
      affluent circumstances do not make life worth living.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0141b">1. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
