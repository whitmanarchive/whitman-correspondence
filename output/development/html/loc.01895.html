   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Scott and J. P. Williams were New York printers
      who took over the printing business of William E. Chapin &amp; Co., the printer
      who had printed the 1867 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      (actually published in November 1866). Whitman had apparently not paid off his
      debt to Chapin for this transaction.
