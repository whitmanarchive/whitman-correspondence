      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I append slip from the Evening paper of last Thursday that frightened us all so.
      I telegraphed Thursday evening and again Friday—and was on my way to the
      telegraph office yesterday afternoon when I was handed your dispatch. We were all
      glad
      to know that the statement was wrong although as the time passed and I had an
      opportunity to reason it over I felt pretty well assured that there was a mistake
      in
      the statement—The morning papers of Friday, however, all repeated the
      statement and gave as authority the press reports
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you are all o.k. again and able to get around as usual. If you are tied down
      to the house I imagine you feel pretty sick. In my own case when sick I find that
      the fact that I cannot get out makes me feel as badly as anything else
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all well and getting on quite 
      
      nicely. The girls have been busy "putting up"
      large quantities of all sorts of stuff in the pickle &amp;c line—as much to
      practice I presume as with any idea that it would be needed
   </p>
   
   <p>I have had considerable to do this summer—have only been away once (to St
      Joseph) since I was East—I expect to go to St Jo
      the last of this week—and toward the middle or last of Nov hope to come
      East—at least as far as Camden—so 
      dont
      
       be surprised to see me pop in at any time
   </p>
   
   <p>All send love to George and Lou and to yourself—by-the-way I must be
      considerable behind in regard to Ed's board—when George or Lou write ask them
      to please state how far and I will square up—
   </p>
   
   <p>We are having splendid fall weather—never so delightful—I have just
      finished a seven days out door survey—putting up at the nearest place where
      night found us—the country was new to me and very beautiful—the weather
      perfect—it was like going back 25 years. Let me
      hear from you soon—again love to all
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
