   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Moses Lane
      (1823â€“1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
      and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter of
      , and later various sums which
      Whitman acknowledged in letters from , , , and . In this letter, Lane pledged $5 each month. In an
      unpublished manuscript in the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York
      Public Library, Whitman wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed
      quite a large sum of money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in
      Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works
      there.)" Lane assisted Whitman in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from
      , and ). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal
      welfare that on , he sent through
      Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit."
