   <p>Yes, I shall, unless prevented, bring out a volume this summer, partly as my
      contribution to our National Centennial. It is to be called <em>Two
         Rivulets</em><sup><a href="#prc.00100_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> (<em>i.e.</em>, two flowing chains of prose and verse,
      emanating the real and ideal), it will embody much that I had previously written.
      . . .
      but about one-third, as I guess, that is fresh. <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>, proper, will remain as it is identically. The new volume will have nearly
      or quite as much matter as <em>L. of G.</em> (It is a sort of omnibus
      in which I have packed all the belated ones since the outset of the <em>Leaves</em>.)

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00100_n1">1. This excerpt appeared on
      May 29 in <em>The Academy</em>, to which Rossetti contributed; see
      Whitman's letter to Rossetti of .
      The article began: "Walt Whitman writes to a correspondent...." However, see the
      identical description of <em>Two Rivulets</em> in a letter to
      Edward Dowden of . Whitman probably
      used similar phraseology in two letters, one written on May 2 to Dowden and
      another written about the same time to Rossetti.<a href="#r1">[back]
