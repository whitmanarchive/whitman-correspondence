      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have thought of you very often since I have been up here, but have hardly had the
      time to write &amp; tell you so. I left W.<sup><a href="#loc.01119_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> in great
      haste &amp; since I have been here have been in the midst of a very maelstrom of
      business, all new, all strange, &amp; very mixed; but I am now fairly master of the
      situation, &amp; though I do not expect my troubles are over, yet I am better
      prepared to meet them. I have got a good accountant, a 
      
      competent
       attorney, a balance in the bank &amp; ought to be happy. But it cost me a
      hang to leave W. I was so warm &amp; snug &amp; my nest was so well feathered; but I
      have really cut loose &amp; do not expect to return again except briefly. I can make
      more money here, be much freer, be nearer home &amp; have a new field of duties. My
      greatest loss will be in you my dear Walt, but then I shall look forward to having
      you up here a good long time at a stretch, which will be better than the crumbs I
      used to get of you in W. I expect it will take me a year or more to close up this
      bank, then I shall make me another nest among the rocks of the Hudson and try
      life my own master. I hope you are well &amp; will write to me, &amp; will go up
      &amp; see my wife.<sup><a href="#n0130" id="r2">2</a></sup> It is very cold &amp; wintery here, the
      thermometer at zero yesterday. I have just been out taking a sleigh ride &amp;
      enjoyed it much.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have collected &amp; turned over to the Government $13,000 since I have been here
      &amp; have about $100,000 more to collect. By &amp; by I shall have plenty of time
      to myself.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Burroughs in 1857 and became a friend to Walt Whitman, a frequent guest in the
      Burroughs household. When issues of sexual incompatibility arose in the
      Burroughs marriage, Whitman sided with Ursula against John's sexual "wantonness"
      and eventual infidelity. While John Burroughs traveled a great deal due to his
      job as a bank examiner, Ursula and Whitman visited frequently, with Ursula
      visiting the poet after his stroke in 1873. For more on Whitman's relationship
