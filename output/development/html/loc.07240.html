   <p>Your letter of 10th with enclosures came during my absence in Sarnia and was stupidly
      mislaid. I came across it by accident today. I am rejoiced to hear that the German
      L.
      of G.<sup><a href="#loc.07240_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> is at last seeing the light—I shall look out for an early copy of it. As
      soon as you know the publisher's <u>name</u> &amp; <u>city</u> tell me then I can tell my English bookseller to look
      out for it for me. Am glad to hear that "N.B."<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r2">2</a></sup> will be "entirely untrimmed" I have
      sort of horror of "trimmed" books. Well enough for dictionaries, text books, &amp;c.
      but literature should have uncut edges. I had a letter from Ingram<sup><a href="#n0323" id="r3">3</a></sup> today dated 14th he says "I was up in W.W.s room last
      week—I could see no  change in him, he looked bright &amp; cheerful and in good spirits" This reads
      mighty well and I am glad enough to get such news—nevertheless I do not doubt
      you often feel bad enough and I <u>know</u> you are very sick, worse luck. Still it is grand to see you keep up as you
      do—never giving up to the last—I think it is immense, something for us
      all to be proud of and to take to heart—and the world <u>will</u> take all this to heart one day—and will be the better for it.
      The meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> is still creeping on—slow and sure—no hitch of any kind yet
      and all looking well. We have had another charming day here—perfect autumn
      weather. I have been all afternoon in court giving evidence in an insanity case

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      store—William Ingram and Son Tea Dealers–in Philadelphia. Of Ingram,
      Whitman observed to Horace Traubel: "He is a man of the Thomas Paine
      stripe—full of benevolent impulses, of radicalism, of the desire to
      alleviate the sufferings of the world—especially the sufferings of
      prisoners in jails, who are his protégés" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.53.html">Sunday, May 20, 1888</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
