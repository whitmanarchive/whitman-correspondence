      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received a good many letters and books etc. from you and have been very
      neglectful to thank you for remembering me but you must know dear brother that I
      think just as much of you as if I did write we talk about you and dear Mammy every
      day and wish it could be that you would visit us. we have such a nice home and the
      children are so large that you would enjoy them
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I often think of what you used to say about Hattie<sup><a href="#n0911" id="r1">1</a></sup> when she was
      a wild noisy little creature that was 'be patient Mattie she will make a fine girl'
      she is every thing that we would desire Jeff<sup><a href="#n4995" id="r2">2</a></sup> takes her out a
      great deal and it improves her much Jessie is not  behind her they both study hard and it
      is my greatest ambition to have them educated as Mammy says there will be one rich
      Whitman I would prefer to spend our money on the children.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now dear brother I want to talk a little 
      business
      
       with you Jeff and I have you know wanted Mammy to make us a visit but when
      she lived in Brooklyn she thought she couldn't come on account of Eddy<sup><a href="#n1047" id="r3">3</a></sup> but now George<sup><a href="#n0700b" id="r4">4</a></sup> has Ed—and we think
      that Mammy can and ought to make us a visit we would make her so comfortable and
      Jeff would take her out riding <u>I know she wants to come</u> I
      wish you would write as soon as you receive this and tell me what you think about
      it. I intend starting for Camden next week and dont you think you could come on and
      see me then I can talk to you so much better than  write and it seems so long since I have
      seen you that you must come if you can. I had a letter from Lou a few days ago and
      she wanted me to bring the children but I will not bring them it would not do. Jeff
      will be home and everything will go on just the same as if I was here Now Walt dont
      say that we cant have Mammy<sup><a href="#n0705" id="r5">5</a></sup> for we have set our hearts on it
      and the children are wild with delight at the prospect
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hav'nt much to write about Jeff is quite busy but he is well and has good times
      he
      sometimes says if I was only strong and well that his cup of 
      happiness
      
       would be complete but there is always an <u>if</u>
      still I cannot complain some days I feel real strong and then the weather is bad and
      that affects me more than anything else but when I see you I  will have a good talk
   </p>
   
   
   <p>the children have just returned from dancing school and are practicing some new steps
      they send lots of love to you and told me they would write soon Jeff has gone to the
      Opera and now with much love
   </p>

      I subscribe myself your devoted
      <br></br>Sister Mattie

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Martha Mitchell Whitman (d. 1873) known as "Mattie,"
      was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and
      Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
      the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat
      ailment that would lead to her death in 1873.

   <p id="n4995">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <p id="n1047">3. Edward Whitman (1835–1892),
      called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for significant physical and
      mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his mother until her death.
      George Whitman and his wife Louisa Orr Haslam cared for Eddy after Louisa's
      death, with financial support from Walt Whitman. For more information on Edward,
      see Randall Waldron, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_221.html">Whitman, Edward (1835–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="n0700b">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was Walt's brother and the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman. He was ten years Walt Whitman's junior. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n0705">5. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
