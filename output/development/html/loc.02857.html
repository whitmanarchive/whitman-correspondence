      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman Esq
      <br></br>
      Dr
      
      
      
      Frind
      
       and elder brother
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have waited till I am afraid you have forgotten me or else never received the
      letter I wrote in answer to yours of date "a long time ago" (<u>very definite</u>) in reply to my first to
      you: I am inclined to believe that your silence does not mean that you do not wish
      to hear from me again. You remember the "Dear Strange Boy and brother" as you were
      pleased to call me do you not?
   </p>
   
   <p>I have an impression that I can give a reason why you did not answer my last though
      I
       perhaps do you
      injustice in the thought. When I wrote I said something I think about
      Wentworth having the copyright of your book. Now it strikes me that
      you might have thought me interested in the matter but I am not nor have I ever
      been. You do not need that I should go into particulars to tell you the conclusion
      arrived at about the matter. If I did you injustice pardon me.
   </p>
   
   <p>The past six months has brought changes to me as it probably has to you and I have
      had some sad experiences though I thrive I am all the better for it. Besides the
      experience has taught me many things that I should probably have never otherwise
      learned. Some times the world seems very dark but is only brighter for it when the
      clouds have passed away. I think we never enjoy any thing till we have suffered the
      opposite. And, were there noâ€”what we call sun there would be no happiness. But
      the world is beautiful, happy and full of Love, and the longer I live the more I
      realize it. Every sorrow and sadness gives way to joy when we contemplate the future
      that awaits the immortal soul. Be life ever so weary, live on then, brave hearted.
      Hope on, through the darkness, and smile through. Heaven waiteth for mortals when
      earth is departed. And eternity lives at the death bed of years.
   </p>
   
   <p>What do you think of the political condition of affairs or are you no politician I
      can perhaps believe that you are not interested in such matters.
   </p>
   
   <p>But I will not <u>write</u> more now till I hear from you again.
      Till then 
      Good by
