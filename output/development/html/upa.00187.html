      <br></br><br></br>Dear Herb
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of 2nd rec'd, &amp; good to hear from you, &amp; all—That you improve in handling &amp; dexterity is nothing
      more than I expected—You have it in you I am sure<sup><a href="#upa.00187_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am quite dismay'd to hear about John Burroughs's trouble—it is far more painful
      &amp; serious than I thought—his last letter (Jan 13) just devotes a line to it—&amp; I was
      in hopes all had passed over<sup><a href="#upa.00187_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Have you seen my friend Johnston the Jeweler? His store is at 150 Bowery, cor: Broome street—his house 1309 Fifth avenue, near 86th street—he is a splendid <em>champagny</em> fellow, of the American type—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I met Mr Borody<sup><a href="#upa.00187_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> the Russian in Chestnut st. Mrs Barry has had a baby—Mr B. was to go to N Y, &amp; I
      gave your address, to be call'd on—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Harry Stafford was up to see me ten days ago<sup><a href="#upa.00187_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—They are all going to move from the Creek (as Montgomery S[tafford]<sup><a href="#upa.00187_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> wants the farm)—They are going over to Glendale, to take the store there on the corner,
      opposite the church—are to move early in March—They are all well—I saw Capt. Townsend
      since<sup><a href="#upa.00187_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—all well yet—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing new or different with me—I keep pretty well—My wrist, right arm &amp; shoulder
      &amp;c are <em>symptomising</em> a little, possibly for another March attack of that nerve-inflammation &amp; rheumatism—(but
      I must not cry till I am hurt)—My brother &amp; sister are well—Love to you, Herb, boy—&amp;
      to your dear mother<sup><a href="#upa.00187_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> &amp; Giddy<sup><a href="#upa.00187_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>—

   <p>Herb, why don't you all get a big cheap house in Brooklyn by the month or quarter,
      with the privilege of keeping it for two or three years?—room enough for all hands—Percy<sup><a href="#upa.00187_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> &amp; his if he chooses to come on—a room for me—I would come on &amp; stay &amp; pay a moderate
      board—Can't we make it pay?

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00187_n1">1. The envelope for this letter
      bears the address: Herbert H Gilchrist | 112 Madison Avenue | New York City. It
      is postmarked: Camden | Feb | 6 | N.J.; New York | Feb 6 | 8 PM | 79 |
      (?).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00187_n2">2. In his , letter to "Dear Darling Walt,"
      Herbert mentioned the development of a "tenfold facility with my brush since the
      autumn" and receptions given by various New Yorkers which were attended by such
      people as Katharine Hillard and Joaquin Miller (<em>The Letters of
         Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Thomas B. Harned [New York:
      Doubleday, Page &amp; Company, 1918], 173–174).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00187_n3">3. Burroughs was suffering
      from "painfully excruciating" attacks of neuralgia (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.; <em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt
         Whitman</em>, 173).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00187_n4">4. Whitman noted meeting
      Alexander Boroday, a "Russian gent, on Chestnut st. Feb. '79" (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00187_n5">5. Harry had visited Whitman
      on January 22 (Whitman's Commonplace Book); see also his letter to Whitman of
      .<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00187_n6">6. George Stafford's older
      brother, Montgomery (1820–1907).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00187_n7">7. Captain Vandoren Townsend
      was married to Patience, George Stafford's sister.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00187_n8">8. After moving from
      Massachusetts to New York, Anne Gilchrist wrote frequently and impatiently to
      Whitman (<em>Walt Whitman: The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin
      Haviland Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 3:147).
      She wanted him to come to see her. "Are you never coming?" she asked on . "I do long &amp; long to see you" (<em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em>, 171).
      Whitman did not hurry—he never did when he was importuned—and he
      arrived in New York on April 9. In fact, he apparently did not write to Anne
      until March 27 (see the letter from Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of ).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00187_n9">9. Grace, Herbert's
      sister.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00187_n10">10. Herbert's married
      brother, a metallurgist (1851–1935). On  Anne Gilchrist informed Whitman that Percy was about to lose his
      position, and that she wondered about his making a career in America, but by
      , she had come to the conclusion
      that Percy should remain in England (<em>The Letters of Anne
         Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em>, 167, 169–170). Percy's problems
      created a great deal of uncertainly for Anne, since she had to assist her son,
      as she wrote to Beatrice on January 28, "with a little of the money that was to
      have taken us back—so that even if he gets an opening in England &amp;
      decides not to come, we may have to wait another year, &amp; contrive to get a
      little forward in money matters somehow or other before we can go" (Feinberg).
      At this time Percy was engaged in experiments which led to the establishment of
      the Basic Bessemer Process; see <em>Obituary Notices of Fellows of
         the Royal Society</em>, 2 (1936–1938), 19–24.<a href="#r10">[back]
