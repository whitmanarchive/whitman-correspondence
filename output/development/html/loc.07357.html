      such a man ought to have written on such a subject. The singular thing to me is that
      he does not seem to understand the least what you are driving at, what you are <u>there for</u>. He speaks for instance of "Walt Whitman whose

   <p>How strange too (to cite a small but significant point) that he does not know that

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0615">1. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07357_n1">2. In his  letter, Whitman told Bucke that Symonds
      had sent him a copy of his <em>Essays</em>. The poet "doubt[ed]
      whether [Symonds] has gripp'd 'democratic art' by the nuts, or L of G. either."
      In his  response to Bucke's criticism in
      this letter, however, Whitman observed: "you are a little more severe on Symonds
      than I sh'd be."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07357_n2">3. In his first footnote
      to "Democratic Art," Symonds observes: "'Poetry of the Future' (<em>North American Review</em>, February, 1881—why not
      included in his 'November Boughs,' I know not)" (see John Addington Symonds, <em>Essays Speculative and Suggestive</em> [London: Chapman and
      Hall, 1890], 242). Bucke correctly points out that "The Poetry of the Future,"
      which first appeared in the <em>North American Review</em> 132.291
      (February 1881): 195-210, was reprinted, in a slightly revised form, as "Poetry
      To-day in America—Shakspere—The Future" in <em>Specimen Days &amp; Collect</em> (1882) (see <em>Prose
         Works</em> 2: 474-490). In a letter to Whitman of , Symonds confessed that he had discovered this error and
      hoped to correct it in future editions. According to Schueller and Peters, the
      change was never made (see <em>The Letters of John Addington
         Symonds, Volume III: 1885-1893</em>, ed. Herbert M. Schueller and Robert L.
      Peters [Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1969], 481-482, 484n).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07357_n3">4. See Whitman's  letter to Bucke, with which he sent the
      various items Bucke refers to in this letter.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07357_n4">5. Whitman's "Rejoinder"
      was a discussion of some points raised by Symonds in "Democratic Art." It was
      published as "An Old Man's Rejoinder" in <em>The Critic</em> 17
      (16 August 1890): 85-86. It was reprinted in <em>Good-Bye My
         Fancy</em> (see <em>Prose Works</em> 2: 655-658).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07357_n5">6. Charles J. Woodbury, who met
      Emerson in 1865, spread the story that Emerson told him that he once met Whitman
      for dinner at the Astor House in New York, and that the poet showed up without a
      coat, as if to "dine in his shirsleeves." Whitman denied the rumor. For one of
      Whitman's responses to the shirtsleeves lie, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/7/med.00007.37.html">Monday, August, 11, 1890</a>.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">7. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07357_n6">8. Bucke is probably referring
      to Kennedy's most recent letter, dated .<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07357_n7">9. The letter referred to here
      is most likely the famous  letter from
      Symonds, to which Whitman probably responded on , though only a draft of the poet's letter survives. However,
      Whitman also promised to pass along "an older letter" from Symonds in his  letter to Bucke. The older letter would
      probably be Symonds' passionate letter of , which prefigured Symonds' August 3rd letter. Whitman mentioned
      this older letter in his 
      letter to Bucke.<a href="#r9">[back]
