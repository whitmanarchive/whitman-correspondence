      <br></br>Richmond.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt;
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The month Ends today—I have been here five weeks. How time <u>fugits</u>! I begin to feel restless to begin another seige of work. But
      mother is plotting ways to keep me here. I should like to stay with her. She has so
      much to say, &amp; remembers everything of our family life so clearly. And
      then, she is lonesome. My sister has gone home. My brother 
       
      is busy in the shop; &amp; the children in school. I hate to leave her with her uncertain
      step,
      &amp; to the necessity of sitting alone to brood over the past. She dont exactly
      see why I can not do my work here. I explain; she understands for the moment; &amp;
      then returns to [
      <span class="unclear">the?</span>]
       charge next
      day or two. Still, finally, she accepts the inevitable, and as the old hymn
      says—"Puts a cheerful courage on–."
   </p> 
   
   <p>I am modeling a small bust of her. I tell her she has eyebrows like yours; cheeks
      like [
      <span class="unclear">Shillales?</span>]
      ; and a
      double wallop under chin like Dr. Holmes.<sup><a href="#n3024" id="r1">1</a></sup> Her eyes have sort of grown together at
      the sides, so 
      only a round black spot appears. I shall bring on my bust of her when I come. My
      sister has a great amount of executive ability, and though moral &amp; liberal in all
      religious matters, almost
      to the verge of non-believing, she has the bump of discipline &amp; order big enough
      to serve the German Empire. Mother &amp; the rest of us are inclined to be lax in all
      such matters. So you see what's the matter when she (sister) is here. But, <u>More's</u> the matter now she's gone, and <u>I</u> assume charge. My brother's wife died some years ago, leaving 3
      children. The boy, Henry, 16 years old, spends much of his time since I have been
      
      here, "drawing Walter Whitman." I often look in upon you silently, &amp; see you and
      the room: The sitting room with Mrs. Davis,<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r2">2</a></sup> the cat &amp; dog; robin &amp;
      [
      <span class="unclear">bantams?</span>]
      . And out beyond, the "hens and things"—minus one thing!  And so, how is Aunt
      [
      <span class="unclear">Mary?</span>]
      . Somehow with her [
      <span class="unclear">
         croneing?</span>]
       and her stealthy, flat footed tread, I can't avoid seeing her among
      the immortals— "her back yard when I was a housekeeper and my cellar floor,
      was always clean enough to eat your dinner on." Yes yes; how well she'd
      keep these golden
      stairs &amp; pavements of opal &amp; pearl in Paradise! Tell her when she comes
      around that I enquire about her, &amp; wish her good health &amp; happy days for
      many years yet—
   </p>
   
   <p>And Mrs. Mapes<sup><a href="#n4149" id="r3">3</a></sup>, &amp;
      little Johnie, is it? I presume they, (&amp; Johnie's sister) still drop in &amp;
      sometimes "take a bite." And the other lady &amp; her children—is it [
      <span class="unclear">Mrs?</span>]
       
      [
      <span class="unclear">Cady?</span>]
       ?
      No; I never quite got her name.
   </p>
   
   <p>And of course Mrs D. keeps everything in <u>apple pie</u> order.
      Ah! the blessed old—<sup><a href="#loc.03159_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup>. Long may it
      wave!— Long may <u>you</u> wave it!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose friend Harned<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> puts in an appearance often. He is quite a remarkable man, I
      think. As the old puritan preacher Robinson (was it?) said of the "Bible, "I believe
      more light will break out of it when we are free." "or words to that effect. So when
      H. gets free of his many encumbering, political, judicial (I don't mean just
      that—can I say <u>law</u>icial?), calls &amp; duties, as I
      think he may one day, and finds his way into the serener atmosphere &amp; more
      congenial line of thought. I expect more &amp; more of the real light within him will
      <u>
         break out of him</u>. He has a vast deal of good insights, and seems to select the good  things you have done with more
      unerring vision than anyone I have met.
   </p>
   
   <p>The Smiths<sup><a href="#loc.03159_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> are I venture good friends, but I have yet to discern that they know the
      "track of the old [
      <span class="unclear">varmount?</span>]
      ."
   </p>
   
   <p>And Tom Donaldson<sup><a href="#n6011" id="r7">7</a></sup>—a surprising sort of a man—saying so many good
      things—with insights that don't seem to belong to him (physically viewed.)
   </p>
   
   <p>Well. I am about sending you the Hicks.<sup><a href="#n0301" id="r8">8</a></sup> I shall mail to you to-morrow the engravings
      &amp; also a little sketch in oil on a box [
      <span class="unclear">carr?</span>]
       that I made from an old photo of a steel engraving
      brought me by a Mr.[
      <span class="unclear">Hines?</span>]
       who
      heard Elias preach when he was 10 years old. He says my copy is quite as good as the
      original. I dont think so myself, tho' it aproximates. You understand I have made
      <u>two</u> busts of Hicks—large &amp; small. The large
      one is liked best—the one I send— I want it in time for the [
      <span class="unclear">Fidelity?</span>]
       boys to use in case
      you lecture for them. And then I would like it on exhibition at the Friends
      bookstore. Mr. [illegible]ston's
      brother has enquired and can arrange that part. In case
      anyone should like a copy. I should [illegible] 
      to use this one for getting others cast—replace it with new one.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr. Schultz, an old Hicksite likes the big one much. He was 16 when Elias came here
      in 28, &amp; remembers his 
      stoping  
      
       overnight at his father's. He says he thinks he may find some old letters
      Hicks wrote about that time. He knows that there were some &amp; he once read them.
      "Elias was a great man. A wonderful preacher—why, one Sunday before he
      finished his sermon tears were coursing down all our cheeks, young &amp; old. His
      doctrine was the simplest &amp; most effective—<u>all</u>
      sided, far reaching: the doctrine of the inner voice, this will guide <u>every</u> one who listens to it &amp; follows its teaching,
      into all truth &amp; goodness."
   </p>
   
   <p>As soon as I can I shall see all the old friends hereabouts,  &amp; glean such memoranda as they
      may have for your consideration. The wonder to all is when I meet these saintly old
      fellows why they are Hicksites:
      one would suppose they would take a hint from him &amp; stand by their <u>own inner lights</u>. Instead they try to tell me the way
      <u>Elias</u> expounded the Scriptures. Strange too he should
      <u>expound scriptures</u> when the Spirit &amp; he were
      closely intimate. But—
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you hear anything of the bust that went to England? Seems to me they are a long
      while getting it on exhibition.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hear good reports about the one in B from friends who have been in to see it. But
      no
      word as to its being offered to the library.<sup><a href="#n4150" id="r9">9</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Regards to Mrs. D—And to <u>all "whomever they are"</u></p>
   
   <p>Keep "so, so," "fair to middlin" anyway, &amp; as much better as may be.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3024">1. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.
      (1809–1894) was a Bostonian author, physician, and lecturer. One of the
      Fireside Poets, he was a good friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson as well as John
      Burroughs. Towards Whitman's poetry, Holmes remained ambivalent. He married
      Amelia Lee Jackson in 1840 and they had three children, including the later
      Supreme Court judge Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. For more information, see

   <p id="loc.03745_n1">5. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel, was Horace Traubel's
      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

      facilitate meetings between Whitman and Bram Stoker in the 1880s, and raised
      money for the purchase of a horse and buggy for Whitman in 1885. He also wrote a
      biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt Whitman: The Man</em> (New
      York: Francis P. Harper, 1896). For more about Whitman's relationship with

      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
