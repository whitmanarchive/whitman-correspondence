      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have the advantage of you—I know you well—"My soul embraces you this hour, and we
      affect each-other without ever seeing each other, and never perhaps to see each other"—I
      hope not though.
   </p>
   
   <p>[
      <span class="unclear">Good Summer?</span>]
      , and this I have been living in the woods, with "leaves of Grass" beside me, me of
      my rustic [
      <span class="unclear">sympathies?</span>]
      .
   </p>
   
   <p>And now that the days are growing cold I will have to content myself indoors. I don't
      like to—but must soon say good bye to the [
      <span class="unclear">Grass?</span>]
       here  by the brook—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Many a time while lying on the Bank of the little stream reading <u>your</u> Book—have I wondered just
      
      
      what manner of man is Walt Whitman?—and I have thought of him so much that I seem
      to know him well—I hope some of these days I may have the pleasure of a visit from
      him—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am spending my summer very simply in this place—and should be most happy to have
      Mr. Whitman should a Sunday with me when he can make it convenient to do so—I go to
      [
      <span class="unclear">Lome?</span>]
      , Mass.[
      <span class="unclear">&amp;e?</span>]
       next week, for a change—but will be at home in a few weeks—and will be pleased to
      see you at any time—
   </p>
   
   <p>Hope you will pardon my intrusion, but I am anxious to know you better, and would
      call you friend—
   </p>
   
   <p>Would be pleased to hear from you at any time—</p>
