   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00427_n14">1. 
      This letter dates to a range from August 31, 1863, the most likely date of
      composition, through September 2, 1863, the last possible date. Richard
      Maurice Bucke dated this letter September 3, 1863, a date based, presumably,
      on Walt Whitman's having received Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's "letters
      sent Sept 3d containing your letter" (see Walt's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman). Edwin
      Haviland Miller also dated this letter September 3?, 1863 or "about"
      September 3, 1863 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:373).<br><br>
      How one dates this letter depends in part on a reading of two letters by Jeff
      Whitman. Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price dated two of Jeff's letters
      September 5, 1863, because Walt acknowledged that date in his September 8,
      1863 letter (see Jeff's  and
      his second  letters to
      Walt). Berthold and Price note the inconsistency in the latter letter
      between Jeff's statement that he wrote on Wednesday and his date September
      5, which fell on a Saturday. That inconsistency makes the dates of the two
      letters from Louisa, which Jeff enclosed in his, nearly impossible to
      resolve based on Jeff's letter dates.<br><br>
      Walt seems to have responded to this letter's concerns about Andrew Jackson
      Whitman in his . If so, this
      letter is probably the one that Jeff enclosed with his first  letter, though Jeff's
      letter, which does not include a day of the week, would probably need to
      date September 3, 1863. That date must remain speculative because an earlier
      non-extant letter from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman about Andrew's ongoing
      illness may have also elicited Walt's concerns.<br><br>
      The most reliable way to date this letter is to the Brooklyn draft and to
      Walt's brother George Washington Whitman's acknowledgment of his mother's
      August 30 letter (not extant) in George's  letter. Louisa in this letter says that she wrote to her
      son George "last night." Therefore, the letter that she wrote George "last
      night" could be dated or postmarked on August 30, which would date the
      writing of this letter (the next day) to August 31 or September 1. Louisa
      also mentions the drafts in Brooklyn: military drafts were held on August
      31, September 1, and September 2, 1863. She refers twice to Andrew's
      drinking binge as "last monday" and once as "that day one week ago." Because
      August 31 fell on a Monday, it is consistent both with her statement on the
      military draft, her writing on a Monday, and with her having written
      George's August 30 letter "last night." Therefore, Louisa presumably wrote
      one letter to Walt on August 31, 1863 and another on September 2. August 31,
      1863 is the most likely date of this letter, the one that prompted Jeff to
      apologize in his ,
      which also included this letter from his mother written "some days ago" as
      an enclosure. However, since Jeff also enclosed a letter from Louisa with
      his  to Walt, this letter
      could date as late as September 2, 1863. Ultimately, this letter is dated to
      accord with Louisa's statement on the Brooklyn draft and with her having
      written George's August 30 letter "last night."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00427_n2">2. George Washington Whitman's
      (1829–1901) late August letter is not extant. George was the sixth child
      of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and he was ten years
      younger than Walt. George enlisted in the Union army in 1861 and remained on
      active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle
      of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of
      Poplar Grove (September 1864). For more on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]

      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00423_n3">4. Andrew Jackson Whitman
      (1827–1863) was Walter Whitman, Sr., and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son,
      and Walt Whitman's brother. Andrew developed a drinking problem that contributed
      to his early death, leaving behind his wife Nancy McClure Whitman, who was
      pregnant with son Andrew, Jr., and their two sons, George "Georgy" and James
      "Jimmy." For more on Andrew, see Martin G. Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>

   <p id="duk.00423_n4">6. Nancy McClure Whitman was
      the wife of Walt Whitman's brother, Andrew Jackson Whitman. James "Jimmy" and
      George "Georgy" were Nancy and Andrew's sons, and Nancy was pregnant with
      Andrew, Jr., when her husband died in December 1863. Andrew, Jr., died in 1868,
      and Georgy died in 1872. For Nancy and her children, see Jerome M. Loving, ed.,

   <p id="duk.00423_n8">7. Cornell is James H.
      Cornwell, a friend of Andrew Whitman, who got him a job in North Carolina in
      1863 building fortifications. Cornwell served as a judge in the Brooklyn City
      Hall and is listed as a lawyer in the 1870 census, which also identifies his
      wife as Mary (b. 1822?) (<em>United States Census, 1870</em>,
      Brooklyn, Kings, New York). He is mentioned in Whitman's "Scenes in a Police
      Justices' Court Room" (<em>Brooklyn Daily Times</em>, September 9,

      name for the site that is now Washington Park. It was opposite the Whitman home
      on Portland Avenue (see Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman. The
      regiments were encamped on Fort Greene during this September draft to prevent a
      repeat of draft riots that had taken place July 13–16 (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00418.html">July 19, 1863</a> letter to Walt).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00427_n20">13. According to the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, the infantry regiments encamped
      at Fort Greene were the 1st Minnesota and the 8th and 10th Ohio
      ("Entertaining the Soldiers," September 3, 1863, 3). But according to the
      Civil War Soldiers and Sailors Database (CWSS), the 14th Indiana was also
      among units "detached on duty at New York City during draft disturbances
      August 16 to September 6"
      (http://www.nps.gov/civilwar/soldiers-and-sailors-database.htm), which is
      consistent with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's statement that she talked to an
      Ohio soldier who had already completed two years of active service. Ohio
      infantry regiments designated 5th, 7th, and 8th were formed early in the war
      (June 1861), and these seasoned units were dispatched to New York for the
      September draft as part of the 12th Army Corps, 2nd Division, 1st Brigade
      (CWSS).<br><br>
      Louisa's word "california" is not a designation for a regiment but an
      interjection that adapted the name "California" from its brief appearance as
      a slang term for money (<em>Oxford English
         Dictionary</em>).

   <p id="duk.00425_n7">14. "Sis" is Manahatta "Hattie"
      Whitman (1860–1886), the elder daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman
      and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven
      years of her life in the same home as Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was especially
      close to her grandmother. The nickname "Sis" would eventually pass from
      Manahatta to her younger sister Jessie Louisa, the latter born in June 1863.
      Hattie and Jessie were both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r14">[back]

   <p id="duk.00439_n11">15. Jesse Whitman
      (1818–1870) was the first-born son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr. He suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence
      for several years before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in
      December 1864. Shortly after an outburst that followed his brother Andrew
      Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened Martha Mitchell and
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in
      some hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see Jeff's  to Walt Whitman). Louisa resisted
      institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her  letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put
      him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic
      Asylum on Flatbush Avenue, where he remained until his death on March 21, 1870
      (see E. Warner's  letter to Walt).
