   <p>Dear Sir:—We beg to inclose to your address, in two envelopes, the three poems with
      which you have favored us, but which we could not possibly use before their interest,—which
      is of the present,—would have passed. Thanking you for your attention,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00585_n100">1. James Russell Lowell had
      been the editor at the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> when Whitman
      published there in 1860. Unbeknownst to Whitman, however, James T. Fields,
      partner in the <em>Atlantic's</em> publisher Ticknor &amp; Fields,
      took over the editorship of the magazine in May 1861 as a cost-saving measure.
      The <em>Atlantic</em> did not publish a list of its editors, and
      Whitman was not the only writer to submit to Lowell in error. On October 8,
      Lowell wrote to Fields promising some of his own work soon and enclosing "an
      article by Mr. S. A. Eliot—and three [poems] from Walt Whitman. '1861' he says
      is $20. the others $8. each." Two days later, Whitman received an impersonal
      reply—signed only "Editors of the Atlantic Monthly"—returning "the three poems
      with which you have favored us, but which we could not possibly use before their
      interest,-—which is of the present,—would have passed."<a href="#r1">[back]
