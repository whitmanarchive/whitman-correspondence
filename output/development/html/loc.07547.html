   <p>This is the title-page of a small ed'n of <em>Nov: B</em>. in Scotland
      I tho't might amuse you<sup><a href="#loc.07547_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—My physical trouble has
      veer'd quite entirely lately, or more truly added to, &amp; is now that senile
      botheration from prostrate or enlarged or inflamm'd gland, bladder business,
      diabetes—or other worse or less worse form of ailment—Dr Osler<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r3">3</a></sup> was here this afternoon, &amp; is to bring over a surgeon
      expert on 5th P M for more concise examination—It has resulted the last four
      nights in quite no sleep, wh' is a pretty bad factor in my complication—
   </p> 
   
   <p>Have succeeded in a cheap &amp; initiatory dress (binding) for the big
      book<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r4">4</a></sup>—(trilogy the proof reader at the office calls it)—wh' I am now only
      waiting the hard press'd binders (at present) to achieve &amp; put in form, &amp; I
      will send you one—each of you dear ones for Christmas—(&amp; good much
      may it do you)—The more elaborated court dress with frills, yet waits before
      desperate vacancy &amp; uncertainty—
   </p> 
   
   <p>Dec: 4 10 a m—have finish'd my breakfast—two or three nice stew'd
      oysters—some coffee &amp; Graham bread—better to-day—a fair night
      this last, &amp; fair sleep—The gland suffering or whatever it is—the
      distressing recurrent stricture-like spasms ab't from three to ten minutes almost
      continuously the last five days &amp; nights—have let up—&amp; the parts
      at present seem to be assuming something like normal condition—I am sitting in
      my big chair by the fire, the stove—it is sharp &amp; cold, bright &amp;
      sunny—Ed Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r5">5</a></sup> (my young Kanuck, my nurse &amp; helper,
      Dr B. sent) has just come in to tell me the result of an errand—&amp; so
      monotonously my thread winds on—
   </p>
   
   <p>My friends Mr<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n1" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; Mrs: Harned<sup><a href="#n4134" id="r7">7</a></sup> have 
      a new: born son<sup><a href="#loc.07547_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup>—every thing working
      well—poor Dave McKay<sup><a href="#n4983" id="r9">9</a></sup> (he appears to be a good husband
      &amp;c) has had a dreadful time with serious sickness of wife—pronounc'd out
      of danger yesterday—Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r10">10</a></sup> continues helpful &amp;
      faithful—Love to you all &amp; as I finish this scrawl glad to give you as I
      write the assurance of my comfortableness—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07547_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Wm Sloane Kennedy | Belmost | Mass:. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | Dec 4 | 8
      PM | 88.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07547_n2">2. The letter was written on
      a proof sheet of the title page of the Scottish edition of <em>November Boughs</em> (1888).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4302">3. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on
      Osler, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitman-dev.unl.edu/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_202.html">Osler, Dr. William (1849–1919)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on the relationship of Osler and
      Whitman, see Michael Bliss, <em>William Osler: A Life in
         Medicine</em> (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">4. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">5. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03745_n1">6. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel, was Horace Traubel's
      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4134">7. Augusta Anna Traubel Harned
      (1856–1914) was Horace Traubel's sister. She married Thomas Biggs Harned,
      a lawyer in Philadelphia and, later, one of Whitman's literary executors.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07547_n3">8. Herbert Spencer Harned
      (1888–1969) was born on December 2, 1888.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4983">9. David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">10. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
