   <p>Y'rs telling me of Kennedy's arrival rec'd, &amp; I congratulate you both for you must
      be having good talks &amp; comparisons &amp; questions &amp; answers galore. Tip-top weather here
      lately, &amp; I go out in wheel chair (legs feeble, almost worse)—breakfasted to-day on
      blackberries, tea &amp; bread &amp; honey —perhaps twice a week some roast meat, or mutton
      chop—oftener stewed mutton &amp; rice, onions, corn &amp; beans, beets, &amp;c: &amp;c:—appetite fair—sleep
      fair—bowel action yesterday—warm midday as write but pleasant—I sit here all day in
      the big cane chair—get along better than you might fancy—Horace comes daily—As I glance
      out in the street I see the great young-mid-aged ice man going ab't his work <em>bare headed</em> under the sun, up &amp; down, spry &amp; stout &amp; contented—&amp; his huge canvas cover'd wagon
      (&amp; fat slow horses) rumbling along—the loud long whistle or gong for 1 o'clock is
      just sounding—the dinner hour over—I can fancy you there &amp; the lawns &amp; shrubbery &amp;
      veranda &amp; all—&amp; the pleasant sun set hour &amp; evening—&amp; Kennedy's <sup><a href="#n3039" id="r2">2</a></sup> enjoyment of all &amp; yours too (every thing better there than you realize tho')—I send
      you <em>Critic</em> (nothing much)—If there was a good flying machine running I w'd flit thither &amp; join
      you &amp; K for a couple of days—

      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n3039">2. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
