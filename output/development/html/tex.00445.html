      <br></br><br></br>Dear Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>You will believe that I received with pride and warm feeling the
      love which you sent me in a letter to Gilchrist,<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r1">1</a></sup> now published
      in the <em>Athenaeum</em>; and that I reciprocate your love with
      reverential affection.<sup><a href="#tex.00445_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>That movement for a few English people to express in a practical form the feeling
      which they entertain towards you has not as yet taken any extended
      development—nothing I believe having been done outside a few general
      paragraphs in journals. Gilchrist will now be taking steps in a more detailed and
      direct way: from him and his mother<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r3">3</a></sup> you will no doubt hear many
      particulars from time to time.
   </p>
   
   <p>The sums which have as yet come into my hands as Treasurer are £22.2.6. I beg to
      forward this amount in the within form—being
      <br><br>
      <span>1. 3 Post-Office orders which will be made good to you upon your signing them,
         and presenting them at Camden—and</span><br>
      <span>2. A Brank-draft which, as I am advised, you can get cashed in Camden or
         Philadelphia.</span><br>
      <br>
      The draft comes from Charles Aldrich,<sup><a href="#med.00763_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> of Webster City,
      Iowa, who had an interview with you some months ago, and wrote me several
      interesting details about it. Indeed Mr. Aldrich's letter was the immediate
      incentive and opportunity for Mrs. Gilchrist and the rest of us to bestir ourselves,
      and see who among us would honour himself by associating his name in this small way
      with yours.
   </p>
   
   <p>I enclose a little list of names, and remain, like so many others who have hearts
      to
      feel and ears to hear,
   </p>

      Your lifelong debtor,
      <br></br>W. M. Rossetti

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

   <p id="n0262">1. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <p id="tex.00445_n1">2. Whitman's letter to Herbert

      poet's attitude toward the "free will offering" of financial support from his
      admirers, was reprinted in the London <em>Athenaeum</em> of August

   <p id="n0259">3. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt

      (1828–1908) was an ornithologist, a member of the Iowa House of
      Representatives, an infantry captain in the Civil War, and founder of the Iowa
      Historical Department. He was also an avid autograph collector, especially of
      Whitman's. He was so eager that the poet termed him "a very hungry man...never
      satisfied—is always crying for more and more" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.135.html">Tuesday, August 20, 1889</a>).<a href="#r4">[back]
