      This postcard bears the address, "Pete Doyle, | M street South—bet 4½
      &amp; 6th | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Jan | 22 | N.J.;
      Carrier | 23 | Jan | 8 PM."<br><br>
      This postcard appears to have been written one week after Whitman's  letter to Doyle, as evidenced
      by the descriptions of Whitman's health and of the weather.<a href="#r1">[back]
