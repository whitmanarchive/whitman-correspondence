   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Aldrich
      (1828–1908) was an ornithologist, a member of the Iowa House of
      Representatives, an infantry captain in the Civil War, and founder of the Iowa
      Historical Department. He was also an avid autograph collector, especially of
      Whitman's. He was so eager that the poet termed him "a very hungry man...never
      satisfied—is always crying for more and more" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.135.html">Tuesday, August 20, 1889</a>).
