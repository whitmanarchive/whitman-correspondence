      i should have some word
      from jeff or mat<sup><a href="#duk.00575_n9" id="r2">2</a></sup>

      you would think perhaps
      i hadent  got the money
      order but i have i got
      it on tuesday  all safe and
      very acceptable) we are
      having a snow storm here
      for the inaugeration  day
      maybee  it dont  storm in
      washington  though) i am
      pretty well except a pain
      in my side i am subject 
      to it when i get the least
      cold i sent edd to the drug
      store and got some good
      strong mustard and have
      put a plaister on)<sup><a href="#duk.00475_n11" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
      george<sup><a href="#duk.00425_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> asked me the other
      day why Walt never said
      any thing about the house
      if he was offended at any
      thing i said<sup><a href="#duk.00575_n8" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      no i dident 
      suppose he was that you
      was probably in a hurry when
      you wrote and dident  think
      the houses is pretty well
      along but george hasent 
      got any loan on smiths 
      house<sup><a href="#duk.00575_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> yet he expected
      to get three thousand dollars
      on it but hasent  got any yet
      the agents for loaning money
      say they never knew such
      a time every one that has mony 
      to loan gets govermt bonds
      georgey has been in lots
      of trouble about his paymen<sup><a href="#duk.00575_n15" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      he has had i beleive  about
      2000 doller of Jeff but he is
      in hopes of getting a loan
      on smiths house if he dont 
      get disappointed again
      you see he has paid all
      along for both as they went
      on dident  think he would
      
      have any difficulty in
      getting the loan on such good
      security) i told him i wouldent  
      worry so much about
      it but you know george
      is so prompt about paying
      the bills as they come due
      i have looked some for
      mary<sup><a href="#duk.00425_n6" id="r8">8</a></sup> but i hope she wont  come now till we move
      we will have a roome 
      for you walt maybee 
      you can come if nothing 
      happens about the 4th of July
      and stay a week and then come
      again when your vacation
      is) i suppose there is stirring
      times to day at washington 
      it seems that the old codger
      has done all the good or
      harm he could in the way
      of pardons some is good
      perhaps)<sup><a href="#duk.00575_n7" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      but many i should
      think ought not to have been
      well walter dear i hope
      this will find you well
      and love to the Oconors<sup><a href="#duk.00470_n8" id="r10">10</a></sup> it is
      so nice you can go there to tea
      
      not a word from han)<sup><a href="#duk.00575_n12" id="r11">11</a></sup>
      mr Lane<sup><a href="#duk.00575_n5" id="r12">12</a></sup> has had a letter
      from Jeff it seems their
      concern has overflowed
      once on account of
      the great rise of the
      river but it was so
      far advanced that it
      dident  doo  much harm
      only stopped the progress
      of the work for awhile

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00575_n13">1. This letter dates to March
      4, 1869. The date "March 4" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard
      Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1869. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's
      date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). The year corresponds with a
      series of late-term pardons by the outgoing President Andrew Johnson, and it
      corresponds also to George Washington Whitman's difficulty in obtaining
      financing for his housing business, which led him to request a loan from Walt
      Whitman (see Louisa's  letter to
      Walt). This letter, which precedes the letter with the loan request by eleven
      days, explains the financing difficulties that George had encountered from loan
      agents.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00575_n9">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
      adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
      he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
      St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Jeff
      Whitman. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta "Hattie"
      (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" (b. 1863). In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to join Jeff after he had assumed the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in 1867. For more on Mattie, see
      the introduction to Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00475_n11">3. Mustard plasters were a
      mustard paste that was applied to a cloth or paper, which was then applied to
      skin, generally with an intervening layer of cloth or paper. The paste,
      sometimes diluted, was typically applied to the abdomen and was held to relieve
      pain by increasing bloodflow or by drawing excess blood from the inflamed or
      painful area. Mustard, a strong irritant, would produce blisters if allowed to
      remain in contact with skin. See <em>Health at Home, or Hall's
         Family Doctor</em> (Hartford: J. A. S. Betts, 1873), 297.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00575_n8">5. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in
      her  letter to Walt Whitman wrote
      that George Washington Whitman would follow Walt's advice and have a mortgage
      made out to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman: "i will get george to doo what you
      say) he is having the morgage [<em>sic</em>] made out to Jeffy
      there will be no other claim on it and i think it has been a good thing for Jeff
      as well as george." According to the understanding at this time, Jeff agreed to
      lend George $3,000. Jeff sent George installments of $200 per month (see Dennis
      Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The
         Letters of Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University
      Press, 1984], 136, n. 1; Walt Whitman, <em>Correspondence</em>,
      ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:79–80, n. 11). However, according to Louisa's  letter to Walt, Jeff initially agreed to lend George
      $1,000 and had agreed to lend an additional $3,000 in exchange for a mortgage.
      But Jeff, who had only sent George $2400 toward the mortgage, wanted to be
      repaid the initial $1,000 immediately—even though Jeff had ceased making
      $200 monthly payments on the promised $3,000 while $600 short of $3,000. In
      mid-March 1869 Louisa asked Walt to lend George $600, and Walt apparently agreed
      (see Louisa's  letter and Jeff's
       letter to Walt). The reason
      that Walt could be "offended at any thing i said" is uncertain, but George may
      have hinted already that he would ask Walt for a loan and so had become anxious
      about Walt's silence on the matter.<a href="#r5">[back]

      started a building business with a partner named Smith in 1865, and they were
      joined by a mason named French the following year. See Jerome M. Loving, ed.,

      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George

   <p id="duk.00575_n7">9. President Andrew Johnson's
      late-term pardons, according to contemporary issues of the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, included John C. Brain, convicted of piracy
      ("The Pardon of Brain," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, March 1,
      1869, 3); Charles O. Brockway and Nathaniel Oakley, both convicted of
      counterfeiting ("U.S. Marshal's Office. Pardons Ad Libitum," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, March 3, 1869, 3; "U.S. Marshal's Office. Still
      Another Pardon," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, March 1, 1869, 5),

      lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
      and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r10">[back]

      Walter Whitman, Sr., resided in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles L.
      Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Late in 1868 Hannah suffered a
      thumb infection that led Doctor Samuel W. Thayer to lance her wrist in November
      and to amputate her thumb the following month. For Louisa's report on the
