      <br></br><br></br>Dear friends all
   </p>
   
   <p>I have come on some 200 miles further north &amp; west (from Niagara) and am now very
      pleasantly quartered in Sarnia, Canada West, at the house
      of Mr and Mrs Pardee. (Mr P is one of the Queen's big
      officers here, &amp; a tip-top fellow) I am writing this on Lake Huron. The weather
      is fine, &amp; the country looks first rate. Susan I take every thing very easy,
      &amp; so far I have felt unusually well &amp; comfortable in health. George you
      would be interested in the way they farm here, it is a noble farming country but
      very different from Jersey new, plenty of good wood, hard soil, rather
      wet.—wheat, grass, barley &amp;c mainly—not much corn &amp; hardly any
      rye—good for potatoes—all later—I enclose
      you a letter I have written for the papers<sup><a href="#loc.04260_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—George, Harry &amp; Mont, it will
      give you some idea of my goings about here—Susan I know you will be interested
      in it—(I shall send it you in a paper here, in about five days, &amp; then I
      want you to give it to Debby)—Harry, how are you getting along?—Edward
      Carpenter's address is 45 Brunswick Square, Brighton England—The waters here Lake
      Huron &amp; St Clair river are as fine as I ever saw,
      &amp; alive with steamers &amp; sail craft—Every body is kind &amp;
      hospitable wherever I go—to morrow forenoon I am to visit a Chippewa Indian
      village out a ways—&amp; in the evening a moonlight steamboat excursion up
      Lake Huron, they have prepared for us. I often think of you all. If any of you write,
      direct to me London, Ontario, Canada &amp; I will get it. (3 cent stamp only
      required) Harry you write, dear boy—I go back to London Thursday—
   </p>
