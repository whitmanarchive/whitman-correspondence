   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00422_n8">1. This letter dates to April
      4, 1860. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter April 4, 1860, and Edwin
      Haviland Miller agreed (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:371). The date is
      consistent with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's receipt of a letter that Walt
      Whitman had written on April 1 (Walt's letter is not extant), with  (March 26–31?,
      1860) on Andrew Whitman's illness, and with the announcement of municipal
      election returns at the office of the <em>New York Tribune</em> on
      April 3, 1860. Therefore, the letter dates April 4, 1860.<a href="#r1">[back]

      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]

      McClure. During Andrew's lifetime, he and Nancy had two sons, James "Jimmy" and
      George "Georgy." Nancy was pregnant with a son, Andrew, Jr., when her husband
      died in 1863. In the early 1860s, Andrew worked as a carpenter, and he enlisted
      briefly in the Union Army during the Civil War (see Martin G. Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>

      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the

   <p id="duk.00439_n11">12. Jesse Whitman
      (1818–1870) was the first-born son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr. He suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence
      for several years before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in
      December 1864. Shortly after an outburst that followed his brother Andrew
      Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened Martha Mitchell and
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in
      some hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see Jeff's  to Walt Whitman). Louisa resisted
      institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her  letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put
      him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic
      Asylum on Flatbush Avenue, where he remained until his death on March 21, 1870
      (see E. Warner's  letter to Walt).
