   <p>Well, Hank, here I am yet—I went up to Esopus &amp; had a real good time nearly two weeks—rode
      out somewhere every day—Came back here a week ago Saturday—I am writing a little for
      one of the papers here<sup><a href="#loc.04009_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—that's one thing keeps me—another is I may as well stay here, if they wish me to,
      &amp; I like them &amp; they me, which is the case—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Summer is upon us—I have been out in Central Park all the forenoon—It is beautiful
      as money can make it (but I would rather be down by the old creek)<sup><a href="#loc.04009_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I suppose Herb is stopping with you at the present—I send him a paper—tell him I
      saw his mother and Giddy at the theatre last night—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear son, how are you getting along—&amp; how are your dear father and mother?—how does
      the store go? Rec'd your letter &amp; was glad to get it—Shall stay here perhaps a week longer yet—On the
      other side is an acc't of a great wrestling match here last night<sup><a href="#loc.04009_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I thought might interest you—best love to you &amp; all—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04009_n1">1. The New York <em>Tribune</em>. See the letters from Whitman to Whitelaw Reid of
       and .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04009_n2">2. Whitman's remark here
      contrasts sharply with his idyllic account of Central Park published in the New
      York <em>Tribune</em> on May 24 (see <em>Specimen
         Days</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall [New York: New York University Press, 1963],
      197–198). Note also the differences between his public and private
      accounts of St. Louis in his letter to Louisa Orr Whitman of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04009_n3">3. Whitman attached two
      accounts of a wrestling match between Professor William Miller and John McMahon,
      both of whom "belonged to the sect of muscular Christianity," as it was termed
      in the days before television. McMahon was the victor.<a href="#r3">[back]
