   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00179_n1">1. This letter dates to
      between May 28 and June 1, 1868. Richard Maurice Bucke dated this letter
      only to the decade of the 1860s. Edwin Haviland Miller did not assign a date
      in his calendar of letters (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:366).<br><br>
      Due to its continuation of the discussion on the replacement of the Brooklyn
      postmaster, which occurred on May 12, 1868, this letter must follow Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's 
      letter to Walt Whitman. Other items in the letter narrow the range of
      possible dates but are difficult to reconcile exactly. Louisa refers to a
      letter from Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman that she received, which dated
      the "26th." She also wrote that Ansel Van Nostrand was "here this week as
      the grand masonic lodge meets." According to the <em>Brooklyn
         Daily Eagle</em>, an Odd Fellows lodge held a ceremony on May 26. Though
      the Odd Fellows were not affiliated with the Freemasons, Louisa probably
      referred to Ansel's lodge. Because she "look[s] for Ansel here this week,"
      she most likely wrote on May 29 (Sunday) or the following day.<br><br>
      Walt forwarded this letter to Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman in St. Louis
      because Mattie responded to Louisa's "account of poor Wright" from this
      letter (see Mattie's June 8, 1868 letter to Louisa, in Randall H. Waldron,
      ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1971], 55). To allow for the receipt
      of Jeff's letter (May 26) and Ansel's visit to the Odd Fellows lodge, for
      the letter from Louisa in Brooklyn to reach Walt in Washington, D.C., for
      him to forward it to Mattie, and for Mattie to have received it "last week"
      (Sunday, May 30–Saturday, June 6), Louisa must have sent this letter
      to Walt no later than June 1, 1868.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n3">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">4. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">5. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00179_n9">6. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      inserted the letter "u" above the word "cold." She used both spellings "cold"
      and "could."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00179_n10">7. The spelling may be "easiy"
      or "easey." Louisa Van Velsor Whitman may have intended "easy" or
      "easily."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00179_n12">8. The last letter of the word
      "office" is not visible in the image. The letter is pasted into a manuscript
      book, and the tipping into the binding often obscures the final letters on the
      edge closest to the binding in the page image. Most Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      manuscript letters in the bound volume entitled <em>Walt Whitman:
         A Series of Thirteen Letters from His Mother to Her Son</em>, held at the
      Harry Ransom Center, have missing text on at least one surface. Text on this
      letter surface is recorded based on an examination of the physical volume, which
      allows more text to be recovered.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00179_n14">9. Both here and later in
      the letter Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's intended word is probably "there,"
      but she somewhat uncharacteristically omitted the final "e." As Louisa's
      spelling varies, "ther" may be a shortened form. It is also possible that
      she emphasized the temporal dimension of her doubts about the postmaster's
      claim of a "long time," which she was convinced contradicted the newspaper
      report that Simonson replaced Roberts on May 12: in that case, the word is
      possibly "then."<br><br>
      Postmaster Samuel H. Roberts was removed from office and replaced by Joseph
      M. Simonson because the former "has been unpleasantly short, and for some
      reason has been unable to send forward the balances due the government"
      ("Removal of the Postmaster," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>,
      May 12, 1868, 3). The cause for the misunderstanding between Louisa and
      Postmaster Simonson is unclear. Simonson may have misled her, or he may have
      affirmed that he had been at the Brooklyn post office even if not in the
      position of postmaster.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00179_n5">10. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      had been annoyed for some time with missing letters: "it seems hard to get
      honest people in the post offices" (see her  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00179_n8">11. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      also referred to Jane McClure in her letters as "janey maquire." Jane McClure
      was the sister-in-law of Nancy McClure, the widow of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      son Andrew Jackson Whitman (1827–1863). Jane was married to Nancy's
      brother Edward McClure, a janitor in the Brooklyn courthouse. Jane McClure often
      addressed Louisa about improving the condition of Andrew and Nancy's children.

         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00179_n7">12. A Major (later Colonel) John
      Gibson Wright was taken prisoner with George Washington Whitman at Petersburg
      (September 1864). This George Wright, perhaps John's brother, is mentioned also
      in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's 
      letter to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00179_n11">13. A new Odd Fellows Lodge
      at Myrtle and Kent Avenue was dedicated on May 26, 1868, and Ansel Van
      Nostrand was presumably one of the attending "members of the Order from New
      York" ("Institution of a New Lodge of Odd Fellows," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, May 27, 1868, 3). The Odd Fellows, though
      independent of the Freemasons, were likewise a fraternal organization
      devoted to beneficence and self-improvement. The following year Ansel was
      demoted from his position because of his serious alcoholism (see Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's  letter to
      Walt Whitman).<br><br>
      Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest
      daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt
      Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in
      1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport, Long Island. They raised
      five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and Mary Isadore "Minnie."
