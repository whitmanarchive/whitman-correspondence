      Reynolds, wrote to Walt Whitman on , imploring Whitman to get to know his namesake, who "is a nice
      boy, between 13 and 14 years old. and i thought perhaps you might take an
      interest in him." Walter Whitman Reynolds also wrote to Whitman on , , and . In this last
      letter, Reynolds begged Whitman, "friend Walt I want to know if you will be kind
      enough loan me twenty dollars as I want to get a pair of pants and a coat." If

      namesake Reynolds visited him on September 1, 1889.
