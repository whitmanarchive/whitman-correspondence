   <p>8 O.'clock. I have just seen Han, upstairs: summond by
      her bell, which I was expecting to hear. She was much better than I expected. I was
      very apprehensive last night. She talked strangely, and enquired in whispers to me,
      whether truly I wanted her to get well. I was with her, at her bedside repeatedly,
      and then retired, so as to leave her quiet, alone, as she desired: administered [
      <span class="unclear">a?</span>]
      
      nervine potion, which alone has effect upon nervousness. She had complained much of
      her poor head, and heart throbbing. Entreated me not to let her be taken to the
      hospital. This institution however is a place that many have preferred to be taken
      to, in
      sickness: where 
      perfect trained nurses are in attendance, and all uniformed cleanly; free from noise
      or care: Senator Edmunds<sup><a href="#n4974" id="r1">1</a></sup> has endowed a room there: I [
      <span class="unclear">believe?</span>]
       that his daughter was
      there. Our most experienced practicioners in surgery and medicine are daily
      examiners and prescribers. It is a beautiful situation, not very remote from our
      house, on a fine elevation. But I shall keep Han, in our own house and home. I break
      down allmost to [
      <span class="unclear">hysteria?</span>]
       at times, from exhaustion but my appetite remains steadfast,
      without a drop of artificial stimulant, alcohol or other. I perform all the
      housework, even to washing. Han does not; is averse to having our clothes put to
      laundry; [
      <span class="unclear">their?</span>]
      
      condition is so bad: beside to keep my house free from [
      <span class="unclear">embarressment?</span>]
      
       must beware of
      debt; for pay day comes at last, and my habitation is a guarantee to creditors. I
      have nursed Han though many very bad, very hard physical disorders, typhoid,
      Erysipilas; spinal neuralgia, Hysteria, which is perhaps the most afflicting, and
      most incurable, possessing the mind with terrible conceits, woebegone fancies; distrust
      of the
      best friend. haunted; afflicting to madness.
   </p>
   
   <p>I was much encouraged yesterday, and got away from the house for a couple of hours,
      to see about the sale [
      <span class="unclear">of?</span>]
       several of my paintings by shares or lottery: The frames cost about 60
      dollars, for which I am partly in debt: and every one seems hard pressed for money:
      There is so much extravagance in dress and living: I do not marvel: I may succeed
      
      however—I can but try: I shall have to keep to the house to day: Han desires
      it: I have bought comforters and bedcloth sheets etc, and may be compelled to buy
      another stove: [

      man, [
      <span class="unclear">has?</span>]
       promised to continue [
      <span class="unclear">faithfully?</span>]
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I think the public [
      <span class="unclear">appreciates?</span>]
       my professional labours and endurance; my
      devotion—yet so many have imperative [
      <span class="unclear">needs?</span>]
       of their. George<sup><a href="#duk.00425_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> should
      help us, all he can: Han's friends or relatives are known: and my embarressments. I
      shall assist in bringing her down stairs this morning: two warm coal fires make the
      rooms comfortable—She mentions you and George: oftimes fails—can not see
      any person or talk.

   <p id="duk.00425_n2">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
