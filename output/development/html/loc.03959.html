      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt;
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>I have followed your illness with breathless concern—that is, what I could
      learn of it from the short and alarming dispatches in the "Daily News." I was so
      rejoiced to see substantive proof of your part recovery in the firmly written post
      cards to Mrs. Costelloe.<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>We both wanted to telegraph when you were so ill only we didn't know who to telegraph
      to, as Mr. Smith<sup><a href="#n4979" id="r6">6</a></sup> was just leaving Phila.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just received a letter from Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r7">7</a></sup> who speaks
      of having been back to England 2 weeks. 
      
       Mrs. Costelloe told me that he told
      Count Stenbock<sup><a href="#n4328" id="r8">8</a></sup> that he (Ernest R) had made &amp; lost a fortune in the States.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is a cold rainy summer with us—so cold that we feel to want a fire.</p>
   
   <p>Mrs. William Rossetti<sup><a href="#n6123" id="r9">9</a></sup> is far from well &amp; is away at Ventnor
      recruiting.
   </p> 
   
   <p>Saturday Grace<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r10">10</a></sup> &amp; I gave quite a large
      party—58 guests—from 8.30 to 12 o.c. in the evening. Everyone seemed to
      enjoy it &amp; the evening passed off quite brilliantly.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mrs. Costelloe is sitting 3 days a week to me —how affectionately and nicely
      she talks of you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I think that I shall paint a pretty picture from her.</p>
   
   <p>You forwarded a long &amp; interesting letter from S. Morse<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r11">11</a></sup>
      which I have duly answered: he wrote in excellent spirit—affairs seem to be
      going well with him.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer"> 
      
      With hearty greetings &amp; remembrances to Mrs. Davis,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n6113" id="r12">12</a></sup>
      <br></br>Herbert H. Gilchrist
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am just starting for a sitting with Mrs. Costelloe</p>
   
   <p>Henry Holmes<sup><a href="#n4329" id="r13">13</a></sup> violinist &amp; composer is on the point of writing to buy books

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
