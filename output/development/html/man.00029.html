      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Friend
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Has it seemed to you a long while since I wrote?<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r1">1</a></sup> It has to me, a very long while,
      &amp; many's the day that I have said to myself, to-morrow I shall write a long
      letter &amp; then the quiet leisure needed has never come. I sometimes think the
      best way would be to keep a letter always going—to jot down once a week, say,
      anything that I fancy will interest you &amp; then send you the sum total at a
      months end.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have news about dear Bee<sup><a href="#n0260" id="r2">2</a></sup> that will surprise and, perhaps, disappoint you. After she
      had studied four or five months at Bern the field of medical study began to broaden
      out before her: she realized  more than even before what science was being brought to bear on
      the investigation of disease, &amp; slowly, reluctantly, painfully she came to the
      conclusion that she had not sufficient grasp of intellect to master all that she saw
      a physician ought to master. She could get through her examinations well enough as
      she has done before—but could not she said "pass" her own inward examination
      or conscientiously enter upon practice—she would not add to the already too
      great number of "fumbling physicians". I thought perhaps she was suffering
      from such work &amp; took a morbid view of things, &amp; wrote to her to come home at
      once for a rest at any rate. So she is now with us, &amp; I said we would not speak
      of it to any one till she was rested, &amp; we had talked it well over. For I fully
      believe myself, that though not brilliantly gifted, her intellect is fully up to the
      average &amp; a
      character a good deal beyond—that her devotedness &amp; sympathy would in the
      end after long years of careful study make her an admirable physician. But I find
      her conviction is so strong &amp; so conscientious, so against her own wishes—for she loves
      both the studies &amp; the practice better than ever &amp; is bitterly disappointed,—
      that no more was to be said. And as regards my own feelings (though I am sorry for
      her sorrow, &amp; sorry too that the excellent work I think she would do should go
      undone) yet the profession was like a great man that swallowed her up from me. I had
      seen nothing of her for two years &amp; should not for three or four more, &amp; I
      shrank from the
      arduousness of the life for her. And I have no doubt but that she will find scope
      in other ways for
      her fine
      qualities. So I am well content—&amp; it is such a comfort &amp; delight to
      have her at home with us once more. And the training she has is a splendid
      preparation for life generally.—Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r3">3</a></sup> has been working double tides to finish
      a picture he is going to send into the Academy on Tuesday; but whether it will get
      hung or no is always a toss up for young artists. One of our Philadelphia friends
      Mr. Murry Gibson has been over here &amp; gives Herby
      a small commission too. William Rossetti<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r4">4</a></sup> spent good Friday afternoon with us; was
      very pleased with Herby's work. And then we had a long jolly talk about you dear
      Friend—you have no truer appreciator &amp; friend than he I find he stands fast. Indeed
      your friends &amp; lovers in England are none of them half hearted,—but then
      perhaps it is not possible to be so toward you. We find Hampstead so pleasant &amp;
      healthful that we are looking out for a house to settle down in—and then dear
      friend if only you will come! it is not so formidable a journey as to Colorado. I
      wonder if you have been lecturing or writing about that.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have made the acquaintance of Mr. Buxton Forman<sup><a href="#n0240" id="r5">5</a></sup> whom you know by letter &amp; who is a
      very old &amp; dear friend of Dr. Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r6">6</a></sup> concerning whom
      he has told me some very interesting particulars. Did you ever hear his history? if
      not I will tell it you in my next &amp; you will like him all the more. Rossetti
      thinks that little paragraph about [
      <span class="unclear">Ruskin's?</span>]
       admiration
      of your poems which appeared in last weeks Atheneum &amp; has no doubt been sent to
      you, will give a greater impetus to the circulation of your poems here than
      anything that has yet happened. Indeed every year the soil gets more &amp; more ready
      for the crop.—In political matters we are faring very [
      <span class="unclear">badly?</span>]
       just now. England is fairly besotted by [
      <span class="unclear">Beaconsfield's?</span>]
      
      [
      <span class="unclear">specious?</span>]
       but [
      <span class="unclear">rascally?</span>]
      
      foreign policy &amp;
      I believe he will have another lease of power. I hope Mr
      &amp; Mrs Whitman<sup><a href="#n1046" id="r7">7</a></sup> are well—&amp; Jessie<sup><a href="#duk.00343_n2" id="r8">8</a></sup> &amp;
      Walter? My love to all My thoughts travel daily to America—it has become a
      part of my life in a very real sense. Love from us all;

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0259">1. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0260">2. Beatrice Carwardine Gilchrist (1854–1881) was
      the second child (and first daughter) of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist. An
      aspiring physician, Beatrice took the needed preparatory classes but was barred
      (as were all women) from becoming a medical student in England. As a result, she
      attended the Women's Medical College in Philadelphia. She held positions as a
      physician in Berne, Switzerland, and later Edinburgh before committing suicide
      by fatally ingesting hydrocyanic acid in 1881.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n0262">3. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">4. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0240">5. Henry Buxton Forman (1842–1917) was most
      notably the biographer and editor of Percy Shelley and John Keats. On , Buxton sent a copy of R. H.
      Horne's <em>The Great Peace-Maker; A Sub-marine Dialogue</em>
      (London, 1872) to Whitman. This poetic account of the laying of the Atlantic
      cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death, Forman's reputation
      declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham Pollard and John Carter
      published <em>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth
         Century Pamphlets</em>, which exposed Forman as a forger of many first
      "private" editions of poetry.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">6. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
