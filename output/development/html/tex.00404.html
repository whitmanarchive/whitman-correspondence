   <p>I took from Dr Russell<sup><a href="#loc.00869_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> your letter to Mr Redpath,<sup><a href="#loc.00869_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> to stir some warm hearts to aid you in your blessed work among our sick &amp; wounded
      boys.  My sister, Mrs Charles P. Curtis, has already written you, her husband's tears
      and her own ones—your touching words, coined into gold, or greenbacks.  I inclose
      you to-day $30, the result of an application to my friends, the Misses Wigglesworth.<sup><a href="#loc.00869_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00869_n2">1. Dr. Le Baron Russell
      (1814–1819) was a Boston physician who was well acquainted with Ralph
      Waldo Emerson and James Redpath. Along with other philanthropically minded
      citizens, Russell sent Whitman money to be used in easing the suffering of the
      Civil War wounded languishing in the Washington, D.C., area.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00869_n3">2. James Redpath
      (1833–1891) was the author of <em>The Public Life of Capt.
         John Brown</em> (Boston: Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the
      <em>New York Tribune</em> during the war, the originator of
      the "Lyceum" lectures, and editor of the <em>North American
         Review</em> in 1886. He met Whitman in Boston in 1860 (Thomas Biggs Harned
      Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #90) and remained
      an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, ed. Sculley Bradley (New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914),
      3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp."
      See also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins,
      1926).<a href="#r2">[back]

      were friends of Hannah Stevenson's and patrons of various benevolent
      organizations in Boston. Mary died in 1882 and Anne in 1891; see the <em>Boston Evening Transcript</em>, August 29, 1882, and January
      6, 1891.<a href="#r3">[back]
