      <br></br>St. Louis—
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Apl 24th 1873
      
      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mother—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter was handed me just as I was leaving the city to go to Kansas.<sup><a href="#loc.00472_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I could not answer it then—nor did I have time to do so while there &nbsp;I read it and
      sent it to our dear friend,<sup><a href="#loc.00472_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> as I knew it was very much desired.
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Mother, I can see by your letter that you still worry and think about Mattie,
      dear dear Mattie, and in this you are not unlike all of us. We all remember her—we
      all love her—and I above all others know how good, how true how brave she was—the
      blow is indeed a great one—yet I try hard to bear up under it. Dear Mother you speak
      of dear Mat as being very near to you—as being always in sympathy with you &nbsp;Yes indeed was that true—not only to you but to all of us. You
      speak of receiving a letter from a dear friend—yes friend indeed—and one whom Mattie
      most dearly and sincerely loved—one whom—if you knew—you would find as near the dear
      daughter you have lost as two can be alike, in all things of affection love and truth—No
      doubt you will hear from the same person that I will explain when I see you &nbsp;it would
      be unfortunate and create mischief were it known that you were receiving these letters.
      Mattie had talked so much to her, about you and about Walt, that she feels as if she
      knew you both personally—and indeed I think you would feel the same way—When assured
      positively that you alone read the letters no doubt you will hear oftener<sup><a href="#loc.00472_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And about brother Walt—I am indeed pained to hear that he is not gaining as fast as
      he thought he would<sup><a href="#loc.00472_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Walt is generally so patient too, under these things—I do so hope he is better—I
      wish you would write me whenever you hear from him—as he writes me but seldom—and
      I presume I do not write to him as often as I ought. I will endeavor to do better—Aand George and Loo and Ed I hope they are well—I suppose George is interested a good
      deal in his new house<sup><a href="#loc.00472_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—if I remember rightly the locality it will be a beautiful place in summer to live.
   </p>
   
   <p>And your own health, dear Mother &nbsp;I hope, now that the cold winter is over, that you
      may have some rest from the pains of your old complaint—the last I heard of you, before
      this past letter was that your hand and arm were troubling you again—does it yet continue?
      My health, and that of the Children continues first-rate &nbsp;we get along nicely at Mrs
      Bulkley['s]<sup><a href="#loc.00472_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> and have everything that we can wish &nbsp;I have been up to Kansas City for a few days
      doing some work the pay for which will come in very nicely just now.—nothing particularly
      new in regard to our own works in this city—matters go on about as usual—Mr Bulkley,
      I think, will go to New York, within a week or so—or within a month—he told me the
      other day that he should come back by way of Washington and try and bring Walt out
      to St. Louis with him—I hope he may and hope that Walt will be well enough and able
      to come—I feel quite positive that staying here awhile would do him good and perhaps
      bring him out all right much quicker than anything else he could do—If you write him speak to him abt it—I wish you could see the little girls—they would so like to see you—of course
      I suppose you are prepared to see them much larger than when you saw them last—yet
      I doubt if you imagine how large Hattie has grown—she is quite tall—and much stouter
      than she used to be—Jess of course is fat and I presume always will be—they both go
      to the same school and study well—they take music lessons—and have just completed
      their second quarter at the dancing school &nbsp;but of all the great times and happy children
      you should see them on a Saturday—this is their great day—for on this day—ever since
      their Mamma died they have been in the habit of meeting our dear friend, whom they
      love with an affection second only to that they gave their mamma, and I honestly believe
      they get as much as they give, in return. This has been the regular Saturday programme
      for even a long while before our dear Mattie died<sup><a href="#loc.00472_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—and of course now more dear to the children than ever—for they go over all their
      little troubles—what they like, what they wish, and never could they speak to one
      more willing to listen, more willing to sympathize, more willing to help and aid them—If
      nothing prevents, and they are allowed to continue this meeting—it will be one of
      the great favors to both men and them—that sometimes comes on the heels of the greatest
      of misfortunes<sup><a href="#loc.00472_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I enclose a small amount and let me say just here, that I am ashamed that I have not
      been more thoughtful in this respect—but what with Mat's sickness and my trouble with
      the works I have just about as much to think about as I can hold—I often and often
      promised Mattie that I would send [money] to you—but failed—not so much for want of
      means as for want of thought and care—and thus the more to be regretted &nbsp;Do not fail
      to write me—and if you feel like it send a note to our friend, enclosed in the one
      to me—
   </p>
   
   <p>Good bye, dear Mother and write me—Love to George Loo and all—</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00472_n1">1. Jeff must mean Kansas
      City, Missouri. See .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00472_n2">2. Almost certainly the
      Mrs. O'Reilly mentioned in .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00472_n3">3. Given Jeff's
      discomfiture in writing about his "friend," his attempts to keep his mother
      quiet about her, his conviction that gossip about her would cause mischief, and
      his mysterious ways of alluding to her, it seems within bounds to infer that
      Jeff had a romantic relationship with Mrs. O'Reilly. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      had probably already told Walt Whitman that she had received a letter from
      Jeff's "friend," for on April 20 (?), 1873, she wrote: "i got a letter the other
      day that frightened me &nbsp;it was from St louis &nbsp;i opened it and the first words i
      saw was dear madam dont be surprised at being addressed by a stranger &nbsp;the first
      thought i had was that Jeff or the children had been attacked by that desease
      that has been so fatal in St louis the spinal disease but it proved to be a
      letter from one of matties dear friends" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke
      University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00472_n4">4. On April 19, 1873, Walt
      Whitman wrote Louisa Van Velsor Whitman that with shocks of electricity applied
      to his leg he progressed steadily but "very slowly, (&amp; with an occasional
      bad spell)" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1978],
      2:215).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00472_n5">5. George was building
      another, larger house on a corner lot at 431 Stevens Street, Camden (Jerome M.
      Loving, ed., <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington
         Whitman</em> [Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1975], p. 30).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00472_n6">6. See .<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00472_n7">7. Mrs. O'Reilly had been
      involved with the family for at least a year. On May 5, 1872, Hattie and Jessie
      had written to their mother, who was away on a trip with Jeff, that "Mrs
      O'Reilly is getting Mrs. Noland to make our dresses &nbsp;she is going to make
      polonaise of it and an under dress" (Walt Whitman Papers, Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00472_n8">8. Possibly Jeff is
      contemplating remarriage at this point.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
