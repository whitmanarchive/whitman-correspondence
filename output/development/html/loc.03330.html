      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The good ship 'Crystal' landed me safe at Leith a fortnight &amp; more ago, after a
      voyage of 14½ days, which I relished greatly. I was the only passenger on
      board, &amp; so there was nothing to spoil the native sea-sentiment. For reading I
      had Hugo's<sup><a href="#n4276" id="r1">1</a></sup> "Les Miserables" &amp; Chapman's Homer, &amp; I read
      all the sea-poems in <u>Leaves of Grass</u> with a fresh zest.
      After so many months in your new world, you can imagine how Edinburgh (Leith is the
      port of Edinburgh) affected me with its fine antiquity, its Walter-Scott-like<sup><a href="#n4277" id="r2">2</a></sup> atmosphere of old Scotch city life, &amp; all the rest of
      it. From the Castle, which overlooks the whole place, I had an inspiring vision of
      the past on my first afternoon.
   </p>
   
   <p>By this time I have fallen into the old routine again more or less. One day passes
      very much like another, &amp; unluckily the weather has  been of the proverbial British
      kind,—wet, cold &amp; austere, six days out of seven. Within easy reach of
      this house is a great stretch of grassy land,—called the Town Moor, whence one
      gets a superb sweep of sky, &amp; there I often go &amp; ramble about, sometimes
      with a book for company. I shall very probably be here for another fortnight, &amp;
      then go to London for a week or two before going on to Wales where I may spend the
      
      autumn.
   </p>
   
   <p>I was troubled to hear on reaching this side that you had been more than usually
      unwell, but Walter Scott's<sup><a href="#n4147" id="r3">3</a></sup> people tell me that they have had better news, which
      relieves my mind again.
   </p>
   
   <p>The <u>Democratic Vistas</u> vol.<sup><a href="#loc.03330_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> is getting many first rate
      reviews. I will send some of these on presently. Meanwhile how goes the new book?
      Let me know if I can be of use in circulating it over here. Remember me to
      Traubel.<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r5">5</a></sup> Also to Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp;
      other friends
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With much love,—
      <br></br>Ernest Rhys

   <p><u>10th. July:</u>—Since finishing this so far, I have
      had a note from Gilchrist.<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r7">7</a></sup> He speaks of paying another
      visit to America in the autumn,—"to paint portraits. At present he is
      painting Mrs. Costelloe<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r8">8</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4276">1. Victor Hugo (1802–1885) was a
      French poet, novelist, and dramatist best known for <em>Les
         Miserables</em> (1862) and <em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em>
      (1833). For more on Hugo, see Victor Brombert, <em>Victor Hugo and
         the Visionary Novel</em> (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press,
      1984).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4277">2. Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832)
      was a Scottish statesman, historical novelist, playwright, and poet, best known
      for <em>Ivanhoe</em> (1820), <em>The Lady of the
         Lake</em> (1810), and <em>Waverly</em> (1814). For more on
      Scott, see Vickie L. Taft, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_209.html">Scott, Sir Walter (1771)–1832)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4147">3. Walter Scott was a railway
      contractor and a publisher in London. His publishing firm, Walter Scott, was
      based in London and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and it was the imprint under which
      Whitman's books appeared in England. Walter Scott's managing editor was
      bookbinder David Gordon, and Ernest Rhys—one of Whitman's major promoters
      in England—worked with the firm. Rhys included a volume of Whitman's poems
      in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's prose in the Camelot
      series for Walter Scott publishers. Walter Scott also published Whitman's 1886
      English edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and the English
      editions of <em>Specimen Days in America</em> (1887) and <em>Democratic Vistas, and Other Papers</em> (1888).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03330_n1">4. Rhys is referring to the UK
      edition of <em>Democratic Vistas, and Other Papers</em>, which was
      published in London by Walter Scott in 1888.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">5. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="n6113">6. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">7. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02189_n1">8. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
