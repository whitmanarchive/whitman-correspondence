      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter to Mat received<sup><a href="#loc.00456_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &nbsp;We were very glad to hear that you were with Mother—Mattie and I both feared that
      Mother was having a bad time with her swollen hand—I suppose you have ere this received
      Mats letter to you at Washington.<sup><a href="#loc.00456_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Now about Mats going to Camden and Mothers return with her—our situation here is just
      this &nbsp;we have a nice house—and good servants &nbsp;Mat has nothing to do in the housekeeping
      way—nor is it needed—the children—one or tother—attends to the marketing—so that there is nothing to attend to—now our idea was that
      the great change of air, diet and scene that coming west would be to Mother might
      do her great good—I have a good horse and buggy that she could ride often (every day
      if she wished) &nbsp;she could thus see all the city without trouble—Our good weather is now, the fall and early
      winter—As to her traveling I do not think she would have any trouble—she would take
      a car in Philadelphia that comes to within abt a mile and a half of my house &nbsp;here she would take the R. R. stage and be brought
      to the door—no change but that—and her ticket in Philadelphia brings her and her trunks
      and puts them both in the house (is not that an improvement over old times) &nbsp;The run
      from Philadelphia is about 38 to 40 hours (say a day and two nights) good beds (taking
      a section) and [I] do not believe hardly Mother would know she was traveling. Unless
      Mat thinks Mother would come back with her I hardly think Mat will go East just now—her
      chest and lungs both seem better now and if by care I can get her in the way of taking
      some little food I have hopes she will get along yet
   </p>
   
   <p>Not much news with me &nbsp;am still pegging away—write us what you think of Mothers coming—I
      would like to write more but am called away by a notice that a pipe is "<em>busted</em>"
