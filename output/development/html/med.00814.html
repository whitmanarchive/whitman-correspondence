      (Whitman's Commonplace Book; Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) sent "As
      the Greek's Signal Flame [For Whittier's eightieth birthday, December 17,
      1887]," which was printed in the <em>Herald</em> on the following
