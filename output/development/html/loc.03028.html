   </p>
   
   <p>The poem came to hand, (on the Johnston calamity<sup><a href="#med.00874_n4" id="r1">1</a></sup>). It adds an
      important shade of tho't I think to your religious poems yr philosophy. I don't see
      how you cd do it <u>so</u> quickly. It is firstrate
   </p>
   
   <p>I did make that condition in my letters to Gardner<sup><a href="#n4318" id="r2">2</a></sup>—i.e.
      that my corrections on proofs sh<u>d</u> be followed. I only <u>surmised</u> that he <u>might</u> be mean enough to go
      ahead without me. But I have no <u>real</u> <u>ground</u> to think so.
      Let him take his time.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are having a rose carnival. Burroughs's<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r3">3</a></sup> curious state of mind
      is all right. He is happy &amp; <u>moulting</u>. I don't understand
      him though, do you? I think of Gilder<sup><a href="#n0871" id="r4">4</a></sup> often lately, with some
      satisfaction.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00874_n4">1. The Johnstown flood. In
      <em>The Commonplace-Book</em> Whitman wrote on June 1, 1889:
      "The most pervading &amp; dreadful news this m'ng is of the strange cataclysm at
      Johnstown &amp; adjoining Cambria County, Penn: by wh' many thousands of people
      are overwhelm'd, kill'd by drowning in water, burnt by fire, &amp;c:
      &amp;c:—all our hearts, the papers &amp; the public interest, are fill'd
      with it—the most signal &amp; wide-spread horror of the kind ever known in
      this country—curious that at this very hour, we were having the dinner
      festivities &amp;c—unaware." Browning, now the Philadelphia representative
      of the New York <em>World</em>, was instructed by Julius Chambers
      to ask the poet for "a threnody on the Johnstown dead," which became "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00052.html">A
         Voice from Death</a>" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.59.html">Wednesday, June 5, 1889</a>). The poem was first published in the <em>New York World</em> on June 7, 1889.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4318">2. Alexander Gardner (1821–1882)
      of Paisley, Scotland, was a publisher who reissued a number of books by and
      about Whitman; he ultimately published William Sloane Kennedy's <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> in 1896 after a long and
      contentious battle with Kennedy over editing the book. Gardner published and
      co-edited the <em>Scottish Review</em> from 1882 to 1886.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">3. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0871">4. Richard Watson Gilder
      (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <em>The Century</em>, from 1881 until his death. Whitman had met
      Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1955], 482). Whitman attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
      Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the <em>New York Tribune</em>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder
      one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
      delirium" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">Sunday, August 5, 1888</a>). For more about Gilder, see Susan L.
      Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_95.html">Gilder, Richard Watson (1844–1909)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
