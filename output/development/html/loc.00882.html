   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Bethuel Smith, Company F,
      Second U.S. Cavalry, was wounded in 1863. He wrote to Whitman on , from the U.S. General Hospital
      at Carlisle, Pennsylanvia, "I left the armory hospital in somewhat of A hurry."
      He expected, he explained on ,
      to rejoin his regiment shortly, and was stationed near Washington when he wrote
      on . He wrote on , from Culpeper, Virginia, that he
      was doing provost duty, and on ,
      he was in a camp near Mitchell Station, Virginia, where "the duty is verry
      hard." He was wounded again on June 11 (so his parents reported to Whitman on
      ), was transported to
      Washington, and went home on furlough on July 1. He returned on August 14 to
      Finley Hospital, where, on , he
      wrote to Whitman: "I would like to see you verry much, I have drempt of you
      often &amp; thought of you oftener still." When his parents communicated with
      Walt Whitman on , Bethuel was well
      enough to perform tasks on the farm. Smith was one of the soldiers to whom
      Whitman wrote ten years later; see Whitman's letter to Bethuel Smith, December
      1874 (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em>, 6
      vols. [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:318–319).
