   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07683_n1">1. This letter is addressed: Dr
      Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario Canada. Whitman has reused an envelope,
      marking through the previous addressee and the printed return address and
      writing in Dr. Bucke's name and address. The letter is postmarked: Camden, N.J.

   <p id="n3039">2. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.07683_n2">3. On  Kennedy sent Gardner's letter of
      rejection—"the pultroon's letter"—and observed: "I guess we have to
      wait for the book &amp; pub[lish] it here sometime . . . . I am going to let Fred
      [W] Wilson look at the MS again. He has never refused it, you know." Only the
      envelope, with the second quoted sentence written on it, is extant. On , he commented "I kind o' hope Fred.
      Wilson will tackle in some way my Whitman." On  he rationalized: Gardner "publishes highly respectable <em>religious</em> books (not our cosmic-pantheistic kind, of
      course)"—even though Gardner was the English publisher of <em>November Boughs</em>. Kennedy's books on Whitman would not be
      published until after the poet's death<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0262">4. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="loc.03012_n1">5. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy of .<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.02189_n3">6. Susan and George Stafford
      were the parents of Whitman's young friend, Harry Stafford. Whitman often
      visited the family at their farm at Timber Creek in Laurel Springs (near
      Glendale), New Jersey, and was sometimes accompanied by Herbert Gilchrist; in
      the 1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby Glendale. For more,
