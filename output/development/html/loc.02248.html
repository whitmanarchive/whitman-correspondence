   </p>
   
   <p>I have asked our new agents for America to send you a copy of the October number of
      the Hobby Horse,<sup><a href="#n6139" id="r2">2</a></sup> hoping you may find something in it to interest you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad to hear from Mrs. Costelloe<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> that you have
      recovered from your late illness. Ernest Rhys,<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> who is
      now away in Wales, brought back golden accounts of the delightful time he had in
      America &amp; during his stay with you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I do not know if you write much fresh work now. But if you could 
       see your way to
      send us some little contribution of your own for our magazine, nothing would give
      us
      greater pleasure. Unlike in so many ways as our own efforts may seem to your poetry,
      we have a <u>very</u> genuine and good admiration for your work,
      and to see your name on our pages, although the contribution be only a few lines,
      we
      should regard as a distinct priviledge. I believe you are aware that the Hobby Horse
      is entirely a labour of love.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Sincerely yours
      <br></br>Herbert P. Horne
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now that Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r5">5</a></sup> is in Philadelphia I suppose you
      see him often. Pray give my love to him &amp; say I am expecting a letter saying
      when I may write to him.

   <p id="n6139">2. <em>The Hobby
         Horse</em> was a quarterly Victorian periodical in England. Published by the
      Century Guild of Artists, the magazine was active from 1884 to 1894, mostly
      featuring articles on visual arts, but also devoting some space to literature
      and to social issues.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">3. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
