   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00181_n2">1. This letter dates to
      February 26, 1865. The executors did not date the letter, and Edwin Haviland
      Miller did not list it in his calendar of letters (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:376). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman knew that her son George
      Washington Whitman had been released from his imprisonment, so this letter must
      date to a Sunday, the date in Louisa's hand, in late February 1865. The first
      line of the letter refers to one that she received as "that from George," but
      she did not forward it to Walt Whitman at this time. She received George
      Washington Whitman's  letter,
      which she forwarded the following Sunday (see Louisa's  letter to Walt). Therefore, this letter must date to
      February 26, the only Sunday between George's February 24 letter to Louisa and
      Louisa's March 4 letter to Walt. George was expected to arrive in Brooklyn on
      March 5. This letter's late-February date is corroborated further by her
      reference to a February 26, 1865 article in the <em>New York
         Times</em>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00181_n1">2. See George Washington
      Whitman's  letter to Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman. Walt did not yet know that George was among the
      exchanged prisoners. Louisa the following week wrote to Walt that "i should
      have sent you this letter from George but thought of course you knew all
      about his arrival at Anapolis" (see her  letter to Walt). Walt remained unaware that his brother
      George had been exchanged (see his  letter to William Cook).<br><br>
      George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until
      the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of
      Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of
      Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn
      and began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and
      later a mason named French. George eventually took up a position as
      inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on George,

   <p id="duk.00425_n3">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son

   <p id="tex.00181_n6">5. William Cook was a Captain
      in the 19th U.S. Colored Troops. He was held prisoner with George Washington
      Whitman, and after Howard's release he forwarded a letter from George to his
      mother. In February 1869, Walt Whitman had written Cook, who was then at home in
      New York City, for additional detail about George. Cook replied that he did not
      really know George. For more information about the exchange, see Jerome M.
      Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>

   <p id="duk.00575_n9">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
      adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
      he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
      St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Jeff
      Whitman. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta "Hattie"
      (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" (b. 1863). In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to join Jeff after he had assumed the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in 1867. For more on Mattie, see
      the introduction to Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="duk.00465_n9">8. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York

         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00180_n5">9. Jesse Whitman
      (1818–1870) was the first-born son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr. He suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence
      for several years before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in
      December 1864. Louisa's remark is her first extant reference to Jesse after he
      was institutionalized the previous December. Shortly after an outburst that
      followed his brother Andrew Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he
      threatened Martha Mitchell and Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter
      Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in some hospital or place where he would
      be doctored" (see Jeff's  to Walt
      Whitman). Louisa resisted institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her
       letter, she "could not find
      it in my heart to put him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to
      Kings County Lunatic Asylum on Flatbush Avenue, where he remained until his
      death on March 21, 1870 (see E. Warner's  letter to Walt). For a short biography of Jesse, see Robert
      Roper, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.01011.pdf">"Jesse Whitman, Seafarer,"</a>
