      <br></br><br></br>Dear old Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I dont seem to have heard from you for a long while. In a
      letter I had from Mrs S<u>d</u><sup><a href="#loc.02189_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>—she
      mentioned that you were prevented from coming to Glendale the day fixed but w<u>ld</u> come the following. How I should like to see you all again—the first
      picture that I sell for a decent sum I shall come—Just now I was engaged upon
      a picture of "Juliet" life size, "Juliet comes over the balcony and takes her last
      look at her husband," Oh
      God, I have an ill divining soul".... I believe that the picture will make my name
      as an artist, a few months will show! 
   </p>
   
   <p> Mother<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r3">3</a></sup> is staying away, change  will do her good, has been writing
      pretty hard of late, something about you, sent it to the Nineteenth Century. An article
      of hers is coming out in the November Blackwood
      "Three Glimpses of a New England Village: editor kept it a year so it was a very
      pleasant surprize to all of us—its acceptance. 
   </p>
   
   <p> You dont seem to have been busy with your pen this summer. You must come over and
      draw a final inspiration from dear grimy, glorious, immense old London. Fleet Street
      will give you a
      new sensation I warrant you, if you want one, that is; for there is only one London
      all foreigners friendly and otherwise are agreed upon that; there  may be better
      cities but there are none the least like it. Your poems are gaining ground a little
      here I think; sort of standard works... We have had a smart skirmish with our
      publisher. Made him jump I fancy—but they—publishers—are a damned
      set of thieves. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Dined out in Hampstead the other night with young Bigelow—the exministers
      son—of the dashing fashionable order; with more aplomb than most New Yorkers.
      Young B. is rather anti democratic I should fear, remarked that Mathew Arnold was
      not a gentleman, on being asked why—because he dined out in Chicago in a shooting
      jacket. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p> Mr. and Mrs Joseph Pennell<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> spent a couple of evenings
      with us a few weeks since, nice
      genuine people: homely, but homliness illumined with depth of feeling and sincerity
      of aim, altogether a remarkable and interesting Philadelphian. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Tell me about yourself when you write. </p>

      Yours affectionately,
      <br></br>Herbert H Gilchrist.

      Whitman | Camden (Post Office) | New Jersey | United States America. The
      envelope is endorsed: from Herbert Gilchrist | Sept '84. It is postmarked:

   <p id="loc.02189_n3">2. Susan and George Stafford
      were the parents of Whitman's young friend, Harry Stafford. Whitman often
      visited the family at their farm at Timber Creek in Laurel Springs (near
      Glendale), New Jersey, and was sometimes accompanied by Herbert Gilchrist; in
      the 1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby Glendale. For more,
      see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="n0259">3. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
