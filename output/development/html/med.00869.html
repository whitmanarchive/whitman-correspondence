   <p>Am continuing on here much the same imprisoned in my room and chair and locomotion
      quite out of the question—mentality and brain action (while easily tired and
      sore at the best) remain, the muscles, especially my right hand and arm,
      good—spirits, sleep etc. fair—and the main elementary functions active
      at least half (or even plus half) to keep off so far my complete down fall.

   <p>I believe I told you I am preparing a small handsome pocket book bound edition of
      L.
      of G.<sup><a href="#med.00869_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> including the "Sands at 70" and "Backward Glance," as a sort of commemorating
      my completion of 70th year (May 31, 1889). Shall send
      you a copy when out. Sarrazin's<sup><a href="#n3115" id="r2">2</a></sup> book is out in Paris—"La
      Renaissance de la Poésie Anglaise 1798–1889." Papers on Shelley, Wordsworth,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00869_n3">1. Whitman had a limited pocket-book edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      printed in honor of his 70th birthday, on May 31, 1889, through special
      arrangement with Frederick Oldach. Only 300 copies were printed, and Whitman
      signed the title page of each one. The volume also included the annex <em>Sands at Seventy</em> and his essay <em>A
         Backward Glance O'er Traveled Roads</em>. See Whitman's , letter to Oldach. For more
      information on the book see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n3115">2. Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935)
      was a translator and poet from France, who commented positively not only on
      Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and
      apparently liked the critic's work on <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>—Whitman even had Sarrazin's chapter on his book translated
      twice. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="sjs.00003_n2">4. Whitman is referring to <em>Grashalme</em>, the German translation of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> by Karl Knortz and Thomas W. Rolleston. The poet

   <p id="n1027">5. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.

         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more

   <p id="n0119">6. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n2002">7. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n4267">10. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
