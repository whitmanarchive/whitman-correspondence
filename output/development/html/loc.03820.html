      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>I hope the summer has left you tolerably well at least, your occasional postal cards
      have been a comfort. We have been having a most delightful time all to-gether. The
      chance of an advertisement brought us, family, horses, servants, and baby into this
      remote corner of Wales  &amp; set us down in the old house of a reduced country squire.
      It rained for a week after we came, but we lit fires &amp; unpacked our three
      volumed novels and tried to pretend that we were enjoying it. Then fortunately it
      cleared up and we began driving &amp; playing tennis, I went fishing with our
      vicar's son and soon the charm of the hills, the  country lanes and the air made us
      very well contented with out lot. A good many of our neighbours (anyone within 12
      miles is a neighbour) have called on us &amp; have turned out to be very pleasant
      people, though their intellectual horizon is a little limited perhaps.
   </p>
   
   <p>To think of us you must imagine a spur of a healthy mountain covered with fine old
      trees, a winding carriage drive  through trees coming to an open space &amp; finally ending under
      the eaves of a low, many-gabled old house. Behind there is an old garden with high
      walls in the form of a square which are covered with peach and cherry trees growing
      like vines over them.
   </p>
   
   <p>I try to study in the mornings, the afternoons I give to shooting, fishing or tennis.
      Only I find that afternoons of that  kind have a great tendency to
      swallow up the mornings. Mariechen<sup><a href="#loc.03820_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> and Frank Costelloe<sup><a href="#n6114" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; I
      however have been reading one of Sophocles' plays to-gether. Just now the Costelloes
      are off in Scotland on visit.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are just off to 
       a tennis party at
      the vicar's, so good bye for the present. The paper you send Mary<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> came to hand O.K. many thanks.
   </p>

      With much love

   <p>When will "Autumn Boughs"<sup><a href="#loc.03820_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> be out?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Logan Pearsall Smith
      (1865–1946) was an essayist and literary critic. He was the son of Robert
      Pearsall Smith, a minister and writer who befriended Whitman, and he was the
      brother of Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, one of Whitman's most avid followers.

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">3. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
