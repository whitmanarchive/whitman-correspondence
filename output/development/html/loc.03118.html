   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,
