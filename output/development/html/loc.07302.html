   <p>I returned from Toronto (after attending, yesterday, Mrs O'Reilly's<sup><a href="#loc.07302_n5" id="r2">2</a></sup> funeral) at noon today and find your long and interesting
      letter of Saturday and Sunday enclosing Mrs. O'Connor's<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r3">3</a></sup> most
      pathetic letter, to you, of 9<u>th</u>.<sup><a href="#loc.07302_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> Poor Mrs O'Connor is indeed alone, I fear the rest of her life will be terribly
      lonely. I am much pleased that you have actually been out in the chair<sup><a href="#loc.03012_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> and that you
      seemed to find it a success—I shall feel easier about you—you will not
      be so horribly dull now though you may still be dull enough. But to get out even a
      little while once or twice a day (in good weather) will undoubtedly break the
      monotony a little. It will be good for Ed,<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r6">6</a></sup> too, will give him
      something to do—some little exercise. I am glad to hear that you sweat freely
      now that the warm
      weather has come. It is a capital thing for you and frequent baths with more or less
      massage each day will keep the skin acting and will be most beneficial to you.<sup><a href="#loc.07302_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup> Do not be discouraged because you do not see good
      effects from such things (as baths, massage, getting out &amp;c &amp;c) at
      once—at your age reaction takes place slowly—but all these things will
      tell in the long run and I have good hopes that you may make a rally yet for you
      have a constitution of ten thousand. The letter containing the 1<u>st</u> prescription must have miscarried (I certainly sent it). I do not think
      very much of the dinner scheme<sup><a href="#loc.03027_n4" id="r8">8</a></sup>  but all the same I should
      like to be there (have heard nothing abt. it except your letter).<sup><a href="#loc.07302_n4" id="r9">9</a></sup>If there were
      some good speeches well reported it might not be amiss (I am a firm believer in all
      legitimate forms of advertizing). I should like to be there and make a speech myself
      all right enough

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07302_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey U.S.A. It is postmarked:
      [
      <span class="unclear">OT WEST UR WY ST
         ATN?</span>]
       | PM | MY 15 | 89 | London; Ca[illegible] | May | 1[illegible] | 6 AM | 1889 | Rec[illegible].<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07302_n5">2. According to Bucke's letter to Whitman 
      of , Mrs O'Reilly was "the wife of the Inspector of Asylums."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">3. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

      of .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03012_n1">5. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy of .<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">6. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07302_n3">7. See Whitman's , letter to Bucke, where he discusses
      bathing, the chair, and the delayed calomel prescription mentioned below.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03027_n4">8. For Whitman's seventieth
      birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
      the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
      (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.30.html">Tuesday, May 7, 1889</a>. The day was celebrated with a testimonial
      dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
      addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
      arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07302_n4">9. In his , letter to Bucke, Whitman reports the success
      of the dinner. See also Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.54.html">Friday, May 31, 1889</a>.<a href="#r9">[back]
