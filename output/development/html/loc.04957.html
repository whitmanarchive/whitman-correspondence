      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I sent a cable message to you this aft<u>n</u> asking you to send
      me another copy of the pocket book edition of L. of G. and will enclose a money
      order herewith for [illegible] 22/— in
      payment of same.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>The friends who have seen my copy are very much please with it, and have decided to
      present a copy to
      one of our number (Rev<u>d</u>
      [
      <span class="unclear">I.R.C.?</span>]
       Hulton) on
      his birthday, the 25<u>th</u> inst.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>He has been a very useful member of our little Society of friends and is very much
      liked by us. Since he joined us he has become a great admirer of yours + possesses
      the ordinary edition of your works. So "the boys" have decided to celebrate his next
      birthday (and a recent appointment he has received) by presenting him with the new
      edition, + I was asked at noon to wire for one so that it may come in time.
   </p>
   
   <p>You will get this letter about the same date and we should like to feel that your
      thoughts + good will are with us. I have no better portrait to send, but I will
      enclose a newspaper portrait that appeared last Saturday (He sat next to me in the
      group of which we once sent you a photo) He is an old student of Browning, by whom he
      has been largely influenced, (in theology + otherwise) and apart from
      opinions—is a man of fine sensibilities, [
      <span class="unclear">brave?</span>]
      , unaffected, quietly devout, brotherly
      and loveable—already becoming a noteable man in the town.
   </p>
   
   <p>D<u>r</u> Johnston<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r1">1</a></sup> met me as I came away from
      business tonight + shewed me the papers + copies of recent poems he had just
      received from you. Your continued kindnesses are very precious to us.

   <p><u>P.S.</u> O. W. Holmes is repelled by what he considers your
      sins against the conventions. Here, by way of offset, is an English [illegible], among your fervent
      admirers!—
   </p>
   
   
   <p><u>P.P.S.—12 Septbr</u></p>
   
   <p>I was very much pleased to receive your kind post card this morning + thank you
      heartily. I am sorry to learn that you were suffering from "the grip" when you
      woke, but hope that it has now left you altogether—We got the February
      number of the <u>Universal Review</u> when it appeared. Thank
      you, however, for your kind + considerate mention of it, as we wish to overlook
      nothing of that kind.—
   </p>
   
   <p>Tomorrow aft<u>n</u> (Saturday) there will be a full meeting
      of our little Society—at a country farm—to hear D<u>r</u> J's account of his visit to you. I see from "<u>The Conservator</u>" that you have a new volume in
      preparation, of which I presume that the slips you have sent D<u>r</u> J. are proofs.—Will you please to 
      enrol
      
       me as a subscriber + send me a copy when ready? I will remit cash when
      I know the amount.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
