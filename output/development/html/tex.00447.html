   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00447_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Herbert H Gilchrist | 12 Well Road | Hampstead | London | England. It is
      postmarked: CAMDEN | SEP | 22 | 12M | 1885 | N.J.; PHILADELPHIA, P.A. | SEP | 22
      | 1885 | PAID; LONDON. N.W. | 7 U | OC 2 | 85.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00447_n2">2. Whitman wrote this note
      on the verso of an envelope addressed to Gilchrist at Mickle Street.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00447_n3">3. On September 23 and 24
      Whitman noted a "bad spell—lost eyesight—lost equilibrium." The
      attack must have been severe since Louisa and George visited him on September
      24. O'Connor was in Camden for two days toward the end of September, and
      Burroughs came on October 1 and Eldridge on the following day (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). See also the letter
      from Whitman to Thomas Donaldson of .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00447_n4">4. On September 15 Whitman
      received a horse and wagon from Thomas Donaldson and twenty-eight friends,
      including John Whittier, Mark Twain, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Edwin Booth.
      Donaldson, in <em>Walt Whitman the Man</em> (1896), printed the
      letters from the donors (173–182). See also the letter from Whitman to
      Thomas Donaldson of .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00447_n5">5. Glendale, New Jersey, was
      where the Staffords had moved after leaving their farm at Timber Creek, where
      Whitman had often visited. He was particularly close to George and Susan
      Stafford's son Harry.<a href="#r5">[back]
