      <span class="unclear">Plagiarisms?</span>]
      —how
      people sometimes use expressions (words or phrases) without a conscious copying
      after others who have used the same. Of course it can't be avoided that we shall use
      (with
      full originality) the same language often. Perhaps 
      tho', what one has [

       form a 
      lodgment
      
       in another's mind, and he forgets that he ever received it from an outside source.
      I am moved to say
      these things by remembering how I have sometimes in writing to you made use of just
      such phrases as
      are in your books—when I was not a bit conscious of copying. Notably, I wrote
      you a two-page letter (with scrap <u>codicil</u>) on August 14
      1875, giving you the "<u>theory of my life</u>". Well, for
      certain, I 
      did'nt
      
       remember you had ever used that phrase—if I had, my <u>humor</u> would probably have prompted me to ask you if
      [

       would be

   <p>It seems to me, great

       by your acceptance of me as a favored friend, that I have (the same as)

      question comes to me thus—<u>will you let me resign my

      could be comfortable and happy—but then can W.W. tolerate a slouch,

      despair, to void everything but freedom or spontaneity?" I have been conjecturing
      that the two words "<u>spontaneous me</u>" are the greatest of
      all your writing. 
      Is'nt
      
       the gist of all of your/and the [illegible]) philosophy and "religion" right there in those <u>two words?</u></p>

   <p>I suppose the Radical Review is discontinued—I had thought of suggesting to

      and each important article [
      <span class="unclear">presented?</span>]
       complete by itself—then I, you, or any one could hand

      to have the [illegible]

      <u>obstacle</u> was that the book (1871) was such a big
      book—so much to confront at once—some pieces I did not read through for a long time.
      (I
      believe I would make a splendid [

   <p>Do [

       know this is human
      nature—to wish ([illegible]) to communicate to others what either <u>hurts</u> us or makes us <u>feel good</u>?
   </p>
   
   
   <p><u>A few</u> (and among them two of my best
      cousins—J–n's) will never say "I have a head-ache—I have a

      so pleases me that I can never again be the same man in measured happiness or
      limited wisdom".

   <p>How long before I'll get your next book?</p>
   
   
   <p>In Democratic Vistas you make too much of sick, wounded men not complaining. I accept
      howling, crying, cursing at distress the same as shouting for joy. What if a <u>bled</u> man <u>does</u>

      [illegible] if he still goes
      bravely ahead all the same?

   <p>I am nearly through planting

      things are nice. Please [illegible]
      time let me know if you
      get this—a [illegible] is one cent.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.
