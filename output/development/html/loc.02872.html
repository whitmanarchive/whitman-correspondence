   <p>I am entirely satisfied &amp; at peace my Beloved—no words
      can say how divine a peace.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pain and joy struggle together in me (but joy getting the
      mastery, because its portion is eternal) O the precious letter,
      bearing to me the living touch of your hand, vibrating
      through &amp; through me as I feel the pressure of the ring that
      pressed your flesh—&amp; now will press mine so long as I draw
      breath. My Darling! take comfort &amp; strength &amp; joy from
      me that you have made so rich
      
      &amp; strong. Perhaps it will yet
      be given us to see each other, to travel the last stage of this
      journey side by side, hand in hand—so completing the
      preparation for the fresh start on the greater journey; me
      loving [
      <span class="unclear">and blessing</span>]
       her you mourn, now for your dear sake—
      then growing to know &amp; love her in full unison with you.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope you will soon get to the sea—as soon as you are
      strong enough, that is—&amp; if you could have all needful care &amp;
      comfort &amp; a dear friend with you there. For I believe you
      
      
      would get on faster away from Camden—&amp; that it tends so to
      keep the wound open &amp; quivering to be where the blow fell
      on you—where every object speaks of her last hours &amp; is
      laden with heart stirring associations. Though I realize
      dearest Friend that in the midst of the poignant sorrow come
      immortal sweet moments—communings, rapt anticipations.
      But these would come the same in natures great soothing
      arms by the seashore with her reviving invigorating breath
      playing freely over you. If only you could get 
      
      just strong
      enough prudently to undertake the journey. When my
      eyes first open in the morning, often such tender thoughts
      yearning ineffably pitying sorrowful sweet thoughts flow into
      my breast that longs &amp; longs to pillow on itself the suffering
      head (with white hair more beautiful to me than the silvery
      clouds which always make me think of it.—My hands want
      to be so helpful, tending, soothing, serving my whole frame
      to support his stricken side—O to comfort his heart—to
      diffuse round him such warm sunshine of love, helping time
      &amp; the inborn vigour of each organ that the disease could not
      
      
      withstand the influences, but healthful life begin to flow
      again through every part. My children send their love,
      their earnest sympathy. Do not feel anyways called on to
      write except when inwardly impelled. Your silence is
      not dumb to me now—will never again cloud or pain, or be
      misconstrued by me. I can feast &amp; feast, &amp; still have
      wherewithal to satisfy myself with the sweet &amp; precious
      words that have now come &amp; with the feel of my ring, 
      
      only
      send any old paper that comes to hand (never mind whether
      there is anything to read in it or not) just as a sign that the
      breath of love &amp; hope these poor words try to bear to you,
      has reached. And just one word literally that, dearest,
      when you begin to feel you are really getting on—to make
      me so joyful with the news.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
