   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n3039">3. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.07284_n5">4. James Russell Lowell
      (1819–1891) was editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>,
      where he published Whitman's "Bardic Symbols" [later "As I Ebb'd with the Ocean
      of Life"] in April of 1860.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.07284_n3">5. See Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.48.html">Tuesday, December 18, 1888</a>.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">6. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n4284">8. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="n4144">9. Dr. Walsh was the brother of
      William S. Walsh (1854–1919), an American author and editor of <em>Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</em>. Richard Maurice Bucke
      arranged to have him accompany Dr. William Osler to see Whitman, since Bucke
      believed it would be useful to have a younger doctor examine the poet. See
      Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.35.html">Wednesday, December 5, 1888</a>.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4302">10. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on
      Osler, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitman-dev.unl.edu/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_202.html">Osler, Dr. William (1849–1919)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on the relationship of Osler and

   <p id="n4319">11. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r11">[back]
