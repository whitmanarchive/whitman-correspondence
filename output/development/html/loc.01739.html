   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01739_n1">1. Dated 1873 in <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> (New York: G. P.
      Putnam's Sons, 1902), 10 vols. The executors had trouble dating this note
      because they were convinced that Whitman did not return to Washington
      immediately after his mother's death; see <em>The Complete
         Writings</em>, 8:89n.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.01739_n3">3. Charles W. Eldridge wrote
      to John Burroughs on June 26 about Whitman's health: "Walt returned here about a
      week after the funeral in a very depressed condition and complaining more in
      regard to himself than I have ever heard him do since he got sick. . . . I begin
      to doubt whether Walt is going to recover, and I am very apprehensive of another
      attack. . . . He is a mere physical wreck to what he was. . . . His mental
      powers seem to be as vigorous as ever, which is the brightest part of his case,
      but to be stricken with such physical weakness that he cannot walk a block
      without resting—it is very pitiful" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
      83).<a href="#r3">[back]
