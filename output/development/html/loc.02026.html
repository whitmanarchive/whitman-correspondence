      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was delighted this morning to see your handwriting on a package of papers. I infer
      from that that you are able to be up and have your bed made:—There have been
      alarming reports about your health in the papers, and I have hardly known what to
      think. I hope you will be with us many years yet—but I suppose it is vain to
      expect a complete restoration of bodily power.—I trust you may be fairly
      comfortable, and that I may see you once more in the flesh. The newspapers on this
      coast, especially the San Francisco Chronicle (the best of all) are very friendly
      to
      you and copy every thing that appears about you in the Eastern Press—I am still struggling
      to establish myself at the bar here: with fair prospect of success. The probablity
      is that I shall establish myself permanently here. This is bound to be a large city,
      and the metropolis of Southern California as San Francisco of the Northern Part of
      the State.—It is pretty warm here this month, but the nights are always cool
      and we sleep under a blanket always.—It is a much pleasanter summer climate
      than Philadelphia or Washington.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>."
