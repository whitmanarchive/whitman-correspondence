   <p id="nyp.00499_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd Sept. 18/83." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service |
      Treasury | Washington D C. It is postmarked: Philadelphia | Pa. | Sep 17 83 | 2

   <p id="nyp.00499_n2">2. O'Connor wrote an answer
      to the review of Bucke's biography in <em>The Nation</em> of July
      26, the first sentence of which read: "This is an unadulterated eulogy by a man
      of very little culture or critical ability." According to O'Connor's letter on
      , the New York <em>Times</em> rejected it for "professional reasons" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 9 vols.,
      4:394). Richard Maurice Bucke, writing to O'Connor on December 16, said of the
      article in <em>The Nation</em>: "don't see anything in it to get
      mad about—do you get in a passion every time you hear a hog grunt out of
      time? If so I fear, old man, you have a bad time" (The Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
