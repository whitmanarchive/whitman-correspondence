      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I can hardly understand how I have left your most welcome letter so long unanswered.
      In Paris two months ago I saw one morning in a newspaper that "The American Poet,
      Walt Whitman would shortly visit England" &amp; there &amp; then I sat down &amp;
      wrote part of a letter to you, but the weariness of illness (I was ailing a good
      deal) caused it to remain unended &amp; unsent. Now I have just heard from Mr.
      Burroughs that there is, or may be, a fair chance of your coming to us, &amp; of
      your giving readings from your poems. As far as my own opinion goes, I would say
      that there is a certainty of success, a sufficient success at the least, &amp;
      perhaps a complete one, in Dublin. Do come. You do not know how welcome you would
      be
      to many of us. I need not say  that if you would come to our house in Dublin my wife &amp; I
      would be made abundantly happy, &amp; would remember 1872 as a year good to think
      of.
   </p>
   
   <p>There are several things for which I owe you thanks—two copies of "Democratic
      Vistas" &amp; newspapers from time to time. Each I assure you has been valued,
      (though my thanks are tardy), &amp; your letter has been read or heard of by those
      who would care for its contents.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr Burroughs tells me that you have been not as well as heretofore since the great
      summer heat. I trust it is only a slight &amp; temporary yielding of your health.
      You will be best able to feel yourself whether a run across the Atlantic, &amp; the
      absorbing of new life &amp; scenery in England &amp; Ireland, would not be just the tonic you
      require. We at all events are interested in believing this, &amp; think that you are
      just the communicator of vitality &amp; joy that <u>we</u>
      require. I mean by this, besides its more direct personal meaning, that such
      influences as yours are precisely what our poetry in its
      latent developments needs to make it sane &amp; masculine.
      And I have not a doubt that your personal presence in England would do much towards
      bringing the time when the recognition of your power &amp; soundness in art &amp;
      literature must become general.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have written to Mr Burroughs anything about myself that I thought would interest
      him, &amp; I will not write the same again to you. Also I have sent him two or three
      things I have written &amp; if he thinks you would care to see them he will give
      them to you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will write to you again before long. I hope you will continue to let me see or hear
      of such things of yours as otherwise I might miss. "The Mystic Trumpeter" I was very
      glad to have seen. But chiefly I hope to hear that you are coming, &amp; coming to
      us.
   </p>
   
   <p>My address is as before
      <br><br>50 Wellington Road,<br>Dublin&gt;
   </p>
   
   <p>This has been a year of comparative loss to me as regards physical health, but I am
      well again now &amp; in other respects it has been a year of gain &amp; progress.
      But I don't 
      find in the least find
      
       that, with progress, I slip aside or away from your poems.
   </p>

      I am, dear Mr Whitman
      <br></br>Very sincerely yours,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
