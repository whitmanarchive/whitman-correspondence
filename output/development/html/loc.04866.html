      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your welcome letter came to hand a few weeks ago, and was pleased to hear from
      you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am still in London making the best of every thing, &amp; I imagine, doing first
      rate, I have 
      quiet
      
       a lot of driving to do, sometimes we have a trip of ten or fifteen miles
      through rain &amp; mud.
   </p>
   
   <p>I had a very good time Christmas, went home
       &amp; helped to eat the turkey, all my sisters &amp; brothers were there &amp; we had
      a good time. I am going to see Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> next week, also have a dance in the new Ball room. I fully intended going before
      this
      but kept putting it off.
   </p>
   
   <p>How did you spend Christmas. I hope well. Warren<sup><a href="#loc.07319_n6" id="r3">3</a></sup> is a pretty good fellow &amp; I hope
      you hang on to him for it is hard to get a young lad to take an interest in anything
      about a house, unless they are brought up
      to it. I would have stayed longer with you only for some of the Camden fellows that
      was keeping up the 
      nurce
      
       fund.
   </p>
   
   <p>After being there a few months it was plain 
      enought
      
       to see that I was not good enough for them &amp; if it had not been that
      you liked me pretty well I would have got the street for a companion long before the
      summer was over. So I made up my mind to leave in the fall &amp; go at the
      Veterinary business which I consider was a wise step
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You must write me often so I will know how you are getting along as I am anxious to
      know. Remember me to Mrs Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; Warren,
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04866_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle St | Camden | New Jersey | USA. It is postmarked:
      CTWEST[illegible]S | AM | De 30 | 89
      | London On; Camden, N.J. | Dec | 31 | 12 M | 1889 | Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07319_n6">3. Frank Warren Fritzinger
      (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
      nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
      of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a blind sea captain, and
      Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and his
      brother–having lost both parents–became wards of Mary O. Davis,
      Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
      inherited part of his estate. <a href="#r3">[back]

      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
