   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00637_n4">1. This letter dates to
      February 18, 1869. Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the date February 4, 1869, and
      Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–1977], 2:79, n. 10; 2:367). The date proposed by Miller and Bucke is
      too early, however, and the correct date can only be established by deduction.
      In her February 17, 1869 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman apologized for not having sent a letter even though her husband
      Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in a letter to his brother George Washington
      Whitman had said that Mattie was writing a letter to Louisa (see Randall H.
      Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 65–66).
      Though neither George's nor Jeff's letter is extant, the circumstances described
      in Mattie's February 17 letter match this letter exactly: George had received a
      letter from Jeff; Jeff reported that Mattie was writing a letter to Louisa; and
      Louisa had not received a letter from Mattie. Louisa did receive Mattie's letter
      by February 23, 1869 (see her 
      letter to Walt Whitman). Therefore, since Jeff wrote on Saturday, February 14
      (three days before Mattie wrote), this letter to Walt was written on the
      Thursday after George had received Jeff's February 14 letter (February 18).
      Mattie's February 17 letter (delayed from the planned letter of February 14) is
      the letter that Louisa acknowledged in her February 23 (Tuesday) letter to Walt.
      This letter, composed on Thursday, was written on the Thursday preceding
      Louisa's February 23 letter to Walt, so it dates to February 18, 1869.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00465_n9">2. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00438_n4">3. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">5. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="duk.00637_n7">6. See Martha Mitchell
      Whitman's February 17, 1869 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, which explained
      why her letter was delayed (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie:
         The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1977], 65–66).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="duk.00637_n9">7. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      sent this gift box to her daughter Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde on January 14,
      1869. For a list of the enclosed contents, see her  letter to Walt Whitman. For Louisa's preparation of
      gift boxes, which Sherry Ceniza has designated "care packages" and compared to
      Walt's poetry, see <em>Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women
         Reformers</em> (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1998),

   <p id="duk.00557_n13">8. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman
      (1823–1908), Walt Whitman's sister. They lived in Burlington, Vermont.
      Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor
      treatment of Hannah.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00557_n12">9. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Walter Whitman, Sr., and
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. She resided in Burlington, Vermont, with her husband
      Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. The relationship
      between Hannah and Charles was difficult and marred with quarrels and disease.
      Louisa often spoke disparagingly of Charles in her letters to Walt Whitman. For
      the Whitman family's bitterness toward Charles and the stress that Hannah's
      health crisis introduced between Louisa and her son George, see Horace Traubel,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.70.html">Wednesday, January 9, 1889</a>, <em>With Walt Whitman in

   <p id="duk.00637_n2">10. Chloroform liniment is
      composed of equal parts olive oil, chloroform, and camphor spirit, a solution of
      alcohol and camphor. See <em>Health at Home, or Hall's Family
         Doctor</em> (Hartford: J. A. S. Betts, 1873), 297.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00637_n14">11. Neuralgia is a generic
      description for any type of nerve pain, but it was often used to refer to pains
      in the head and face. Rheumatism or arthritic rheumatism is joint pain, which
      was attributed to dry joints. See <em>Health at Home, or Hall's
         Family Doctor</em> (Hartford: J. A. S. Betts, 1873), 704, 768, 782.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00637_n6">12. The "folks here" and the
      "loss of their father" refers to the death of Thomas Steers (1826–1869)
      the month before. Margret Steers, her husband Thomas, and their four children
      Thomas (b. 1853), Caroline (b. 1857), Louisa (b. 1862), and Margret (b. 1865)
      moved into the Atlantic Avenue building in November 1868. Thomas Steers had
      operated a bakery, and his wife, who would become a close friend of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman, continued the business when he died in January 1869. After
      Thomas Steers's sudden death, Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman replied to a
      non-extant early 1869 letter from Louisa with concern that "Mr. Steers' death
      had quite an effect on you." George Washington Whitman later sold a property to
      Margaret Steers, and the property had title trouble with regard to unpaid
      assessments (see Mattie's February? 1869 letter to Louisa in Randall H. Waldron,
      ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em>,
      66–67; Louisa's  letter to
      Walt; "Died," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, January 22, 1869, 3;
      <em>United States Census, 1870</em>, New York, Brooklyn Ward
      7, Kings; and Louisa's 
      letter to Walt).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n5">13. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
      later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
      Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
      pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
      correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
      poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r13">[back]
