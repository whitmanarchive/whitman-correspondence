   <p>Thanks, thanks indeed, dear friend—to yourself, Mr Roberts, Bessie and Isabella

      sister, for the kind &amp; generous birthday gift—for your letter with the
      £45 which has just reached me—
   </p>
   
   <p>We have fine weather here, &amp; I am enjoying it—My health remains nearly as
      usual, but there is a little decline &amp; additional feebleness every successive
      year—as is natural.

   <p>The Staffords are all living and well—I drive down there Sundays &amp; they
      often speak of you. Harry (at Marlton, New Jersey)<sup><a href="#tex.00449_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>—and Ruth<sup><a href="#tex.00449_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> (in Kansas) are some time married, &amp; have
      children.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).
