      <br></br><br></br>Mr Walt Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am the owner of and read much in the <u>interdicted</u> edition of your <u>Leaves of Grass</u>.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>That reading has resulted in the poem contained in the number of the <u>Cornell Era</u> mailed with this. Give it three minutes time and tell me if you like it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In my youthful ardor, I am rejoiced at the <u>interdiction</u>. It will make the revolution the greater.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>With the hope that I may learn to know you fully I am</p>

   <p>
      </span><span class="handshift">Virile old savant, jovial and generous,
      <br>Why, at first sight, did we like one another?
      <br>The beams which joined your eyes to mine
      <br>Transmitted, by forces within us, sight, sound, taste and smell.
      <br><br>
      You are courted by scholars and soft dilettanti; 
      <br>'T would seem that you need not the love that I offer;
      <br>That you might think the friendship I give you
      <br>As weak as the body that holds it—
      <br>The last one and young one, I mean.
      <br><br>
      But—a moment—is this not the reason?
      <br>Perhaps it is only a duty you owe me,
      <br>The return of a love which I, as a father or mother of ages ago,
      <br>Gave to you, then a weakling, the son of an immortal union.
      <br><br>
      Or, may be, the look that we think the first one and one of strange power,
      <br>Is the continuation of one that was stopped by the sacrifice flames,
      <br>As they mounted and withered the flesh from our bones.
      <br><br>
      That is it. I remember it all.
      <br>How we, two atoms of the mound-building wave of mankind,
      <br>Two hardy young warriors, shielded in bright-hammered copper
      <br>And decked out in strings of the far ocean's shells,
      <br>Wielded the flint-sword with serrated edges;
      <br>Fought the encroaching tribe on the east.
      <br><br>
      We were conquered and taken as captives, to work on the slowly raised tumuli.
      <br>To the mines at the north were we driven in summer;
      <br>There, scourged every day, we toiled side by side in the pits.
      <br><br>
      Then came the season when the God of our people held aloof from his children—
      <br>When the cold, biting breath of the evil one wrought death through the woodland.
      <br>And we two, bowed under jagged lumps of the metal,
      <br>Took our place, side by side, in the far-stretching line of the abject,
      <br>To march through the hazy and gay shrouded forests to our home in the midland.
      <br><br>
      With the coming of spring, were they wont to celebrate the return of their dazzling
      god's favor;
      <br>Sacred fires were kindled atop the alter-topped mound;
      <br>You and I, captives and slaves, were the off'rings;
      <br>Up the steep-graded ways of the mound, we toiled mid a throng of shrill shrieking
      priests.
      <br><br>
      The summit reached we looked on the multitude far, far below.
      <br>We discerned far below us a clamoring swarm;
      <br>A million of up-turned faces; a saffron-hued mass;
      <br>Yellow faces, bright hammered copper, the muddy flood by melted snows swollen, that
      flowed o'er the plain.
      <br><br>
      To the flames were we given, we youths who had suffered together.
      <br>We looked at each other, we two who were suffering together.
      <br>A look that we, with false fear, thought the last.
      <br>I heard the shouts of the turbulent mass far below.
      <br>Sheets of flame beat against the warmth of affection
      <br>Envious that aught to themselves might be comparable;
      <br>I could see you no longer, I knew nothing more.
      <br><br>
      Virile old savant, jovial and generous,
      <br>When, as we know ourselves now, we shall take the last look,
      <br>'Twill not be the last, but the bridge overspanning
      <br>The slumbering tides of an unending existence.
      <br><br></p>
