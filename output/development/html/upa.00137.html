      <br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Replying to your favor of 20th, The terms regarding "Leaves of Grass" are satisfactory,
      we publishing the books for two (2) years or as much longer as both parties agree,
      with privilege of purchasing the plates for an amount to be agreed upon.
   </p>
   
   <p>Regarding "Specimen Days" We could not "of course" enter into an agreement without
      seeing the manuscript, although we are satisfied that your terms would be satisfactory
   </p>
   
   <p>The Study of Whitman, we are of
      
      opinion can not be copyrighted in this Country, if such however can be done and the
      work is endorsed by you, we shall entertain the proposition very favorably, at a copyright
      of about 20Â¢. Did you get from <u>HM&amp;Co</u> the dies used by them for stamping cover of the book?
   </p>
