      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman:â€”
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I send you a little token of my esteem as a birthday present. I am very glad you are
      again [
      <span class="unclear">able?</span>]
       to write in
      your old style a little. I hope we may yet have a second volume of Leaves of Grass
      from you if such is compatible with 69 years.
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish you many happy returns of this day.</p>

      Your friend
      <br></br>F.S. Ryman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Will you please let me know if this reaches you safely.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>This might be Shakespeare scholar
      F. S. Ryman, who likely worked for the Boston Public Library. Ryman published,
      for instance, on Ignatius Loyola Donnelly's controversial book <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in Shakespeare's Plays</em>
      (1888), which argued that Shakespeare's works were written by Francis Bacon.
      Whitman and his disciples took great interest in Donnelly's book.
