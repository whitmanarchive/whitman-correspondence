      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> Your last letter to hand,—Disappointed not to hear a better account of your
      health yet, hoped that you were beginning to get around as usual, and like my
      mother, you are one who misses fresh air so.<sup><a href="#loc.02183_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p> Mother<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r2">2</a></sup> is very sadly, obliged to leave off writing (pro tem only
      I hope.)—a sort of nervous prostration and asthma which aggravated by
      sleeplessness wch has gone on for the last month and the
      struggle for breath is making her very weak. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I send you a letter from one Edward
      Pease of (Quaker stock) an admirer  &amp; active friend of yours over
      here in a quiet way.<sup><a href="#loc.02183_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> He is rendering some assistance
      over the "Tribute"<sup><a href="#loc.02186_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> etc: Perhaps you will write to him or Her about it.
   </p>
   
   <p> Alma Tadema<sup><a href="#loc.02183_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> the most celebrated artist over here has
      written to congratulate me over my last picture (finished this summer) and wch he saw at a friend's house. It is rather a feather in my
      cap—and will perhaps prove a turning point in my artistic career, who knows! 
   </p> 
   
   <p> I lead a quiet but moderately varied life and am able to enjoy my work and possess
      one or two friends. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Thanks for news about Staffords<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> very glad to hear that they are all well. I had heard
      from Mrs Stafford that Ruthie had married; but how young!
      a long hard life I doubt me! 
   </p>

      With best love
      <br></br>Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p> P.S. Thank you for list of names have had a nice letter from J A Symonds,<sup><a href="#n0615" id="r7">7</a></sup> enclosing cheque for five quid.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02183_n1">1. See Whitman's letter of , in which he describes his
      health as "not quite so well," gives a short overview of the well-being of the
      Stafford family and encloses a list with "some names of friends (or used to be
      friends) of L of G. and W. W." for Gilchrist's "free-will offering" that he had
      been collecting in England to support Whitman financially. On the latter, see
      also Anne Gilchrist's letter to Whitman of  as well as William M. Rossetti's letter of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0259">2. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02183_n2">3. Edward R. Pease
      (1857–1955) was a British socialist. His letter is not extant.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02186_n1">4. See Whitman's letter of . Herbert Gilchrist and William
      Michael Rossetti had been collecting funds in England for the financial support
      of the aged poet. A paragraph in the <em>Athenaeum</em> of July
      11, 1885, read: "A subscription list is being formed in England with a view to
      presenting a free-will offering to the American poet Walt Whitman. The poet is
      in his sixty-seventh year, and has since his enforced retirement some years ago
      from official work in Washington, owing to an attack of paralysis, maintained
      himself precariously by the sale of his works in poetry and prose, and by
      occasional contributions to magazines." <a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02183_n3">5. Lawrence Alma-Tadema
      (1836–1912) was a Frisian-British painter well known for his classicist
      works.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02189_n3">6. Susan and George Stafford
      were the parents of Whitman's young friend, Harry Stafford. Whitman often
      visited the family at their farm at Timber Creek in Laurel Springs (near
      Glendale), New Jersey, and was sometimes accompanied by Herbert Gilchrist; in
      the 1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby Glendale. For more,
      see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0615">7. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
