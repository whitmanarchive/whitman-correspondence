      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I cannot find room for the poem 
      wh
      
       you have been so obliging as to send me, before the April Number of the
      Review. If that be not too late for you, and if you can make suitable arrangements
      for publication in the United
      States so as not to interfere with us in a point of time, I shall be very glad.
      Perhaps you will let me know as early as you can.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With very kind regards—
      <br></br>Always your's sincerely,
      <br></br><u xmlns="">John Morley</u>.

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Morley
      (1838–1923), a statesman as well as a man of letters, was editor of the
      <em>Fortnightly Review</em> from 1867 to 1882. He had visited
      Whitman in February; see Whitman's  letter to Moncure D. Conway and Morley's <em>Recollections</em> (1917), 2:105. Morley replied on  that he could not print Walt Whitman's poem ("Thou
      vast Rondure, Swimming in Space") until April: "If that be not too late for you,
      and if you can make suitable arrangements for publication in the United States
      so as not to interfere with us in point of time, I shall be very glad."
      Unaccountably, the poem did not appear in print.
