   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00502_n8">1. This letter dates to June
      20, 1867. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "Thursday" and explained to
      Walt that she expected to move from the 840 Pacific Street home on the "last of
      June." Since she directed Walt to send "next weeks letter" to the same address,
      this letter must date at least one week before her move at the end of June 1867.
      Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the date June 20, 1867, and June 20 fell on a
      Thursday, the day of the week in her hand, in 1867. Edwin Haviland Miller also
      dated a letter from Louisa to Walt Whitman to June 20, 1867 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:378). The letter is consistent with Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman's expected departure from the Pacific Street house and with the Thursday
      that preceded the end-of-June move, so the date assigned by Bucke and Miller is
      correct.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">2. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00502_n3">3. The nickname "Sis" refers to
      Jessie Louisa Whitman (1863–1957), the daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Jessie and her sister Manahatta "Hattie" were both favorites of
      their uncle Walt. The nickname "Sis" was given first to Manahatta but was passed
      to her younger sister Jessie Louisa when Manahatta became "Hattie."<a href="#r3">[back]

      Sewing Machine. For Martha Mitchell Whitman's contract sewing, see Robert Roper,

         Civil War</em> (New York: Walter and Company, 2008), 92–93.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">6. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00502_n11">7. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      phrase "loaf and live at his ease" evokes one of the most famous lines in all of
      Whitman's poetry, from the second stanza of <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/LG/index.html"><em>Leaves of Grass</em></a> (1855), "I lean and loafe at my
      ease." Whether Louisa echoes Walt's poem, later to be titled "Song of Myself"
      (1881–1882), or whether the poem is an echo of her familial expression is
      unknown.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">8. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]

      almost certainly "is."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00502_n10">10. Mrs. Beecher is Eunice
      White Beecher, the wife of Henry Ward Beecher, a Congregational clergyman who
      accepted the pastorate of the Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, in 1847. Debby
      Applegate provides a brief profile of the minister's wife (<em>The
         Most Famous Man in America</em> [New York: Doubleday, 1996], 82,
      317).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">11. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00470_n8">12. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
      and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r12">[back]
