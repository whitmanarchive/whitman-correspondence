   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00009_n1">1. William Conant Church
      (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
      York newspapers until he founded the <em>Army and Navy
         Journal</em> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
      he established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. Financial control of
      the <em>Galaxy</em> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
      was absorbed by the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1878. William
      published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
      Francis wrote for the New York <em>Sun</em> the unsigned piece
      "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." See Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the
      <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952),
      332–350; Donald N. Bigelow, <em>William Conant Church

      1952); J. R. Pearson, Jr., "Story of a Magazine: New York's <em>Galaxy</em>, 1866–1878," <em>Bulletin of the New York
         Public Library</em>, 61 (1957), 217–237, 281–302.<a href="#r1">[back]

      On August 1, 1867, William Conant Church, from the office of the <em>Galaxy</em>, wrote to O'Connor: "It seems to me that this
      glorious harvest of 1867, sown &amp; reaped by the returned soldiers, ought
      to be sung in verse.…Walt Whitman is the man to chaunt the song. Will
      you not ask him to do it for The Galaxy?" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). The editors, in a letter to Walt Whitman on , considered "A Carol of Harvest,
      for 1867" (later titled "The Return of the Heroes") "to rank with the very
      best of your poems." For images and a transcription of "A Carol of Harvest,
      for 1867" as it appeared in the September 1867 edition of the <em>Galaxy</em>, see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00192.html">"A Carol of Harvest, for 1867"</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00009_n3">3. In his  letter to the <em>Galaxy</em>, Whitman reserved the right to publish "A Carol of Harvest, for
      1867" in an edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> no sooner than six
      months after the poem's publication in the <em>Galaxy</em>.
      Whitman acknowledged receipt of $60 as compensation for "A Carol of Harvest, for
      1867" in his  letter to the
      editors, in which he also submitted a second poem, "Ethiopia Commenting,"
      unpublished in the magazine.<a href="#r3">[back]
