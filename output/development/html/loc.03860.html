   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).
