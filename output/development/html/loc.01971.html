      <br></br><br></br>Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dinner hour. I loafing in a Lumber Yard at foot of 35, Jr. Under the shadow of a pile
      of lumber and setting on a lower pile—
   </p>
   
   <p>Opposite and close to me at the pier
      head a Banquet In the
      fore rigging flapping lazily in the summer breeze are a few sailors clothes From the
      galley pipe between the main &amp; foremast issues a Cloud of smoke.—One of the
      men in blue shirt and bare? footed has just come from aloft where he has been
      loosening the Mainsail which
      seems to be wet. He has now gone below
      I Suppose to his dinner—
   </p>
   
   <p>On the
      opposite side of the river MsrBgh.
      
      between The
      Ever plying  ferryboats, the [
      <span class="unclear">trip?</span>]
      , the Harlem Boats. And mingled with the
      splash of the paddle whack, the murmur of the Sailors at dinner.—the lazy flap of
      the sails, the screech of the steam whistle of the tugs the laugh and wrangle of the
      boys on swimming [
      <span class="unclear">comes?</span>]
       a remembrance of thee dear Walt With
      MsrBghs. &amp; Brooklyn, with the ferries and the vessels with
      
      
      
      the Lumber piles and the docks
   </p>
   
   <p>From among all out of all
      Connected with all and yet distinct from all arises thee Dear Walt—Walt my life has
      turned out a poor miserable failure. I am not a drunkard nor a teetotaler—I am neither
      honest or dishonest I have my family in Brooklyn and am supporting them—I never stole robbed, cheated nor defrauded, any person out
      of anything, and yet I feel that I have not been honest to myself— <u>my family nor my</u> friends
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p><u>One Oclock</u>, the Banquet is laden with Coal and the carts have come
   </p>
   <p> The old old Poems Walt. The cart backs up, the bucket comes up full and goes down
      Empty. The men argue and swear. The wind blows the coal dust over man &amp; beast and
      now it reaches me.
