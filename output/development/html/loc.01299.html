   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Herbert Clifford (b. 1848) was
      a Unitarian minister from Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennyslvania. In an 1890
      interview, Whitman agreed with Clifford's assessment of the poet as a "prophet
      and bard." See "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00550.html">Walt Whitman on Himself</a>." Shortly after Whitman's death in March
      1892, Clifford contributed to "Sprigs of Lilac for Walt Whitman" in <em>The Conservator</em>, writing, "It was a great honor and
      sacred service to be one of the friends chosen to bear Walt Whitman to his final
      resting-place" (<em>The Conservator</em>, [June 1892], 26). Later,
      Clifford was part of the Philadelphia branch of the Walt Whitman Fellowship.
      Whitman referred to him as "a man-minister, not a minister-man" (Horace Traubel,
      <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.82.html">Monday, June 18,1888</a>).

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
