   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00518_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: London | AM | MR [illegible]
      | 88 | Canada; New York | Mar 8 | 9 30 AM | [illegible]8 | [illegible]; Camden,
      N.J. | Mar | [illegible] | 5 PM | [illegible] | Rec'd. Whitman cut the sides
      of the envelope and used the inside as a sheet of paper on which he drafted
      lines that would become part of his poem "The Wallabout Martyrs," the same poem
      that he drafted on the versos of Bucke's letter. Whitman noted that he sent the
      poem to the <em>New York Herald</em> on March 11 at the bottom of
      his draft. "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00115.html">The Wallabout Martyrs</a>" was published in the <em>New
         York Herald</em> on March 16, 1888.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4133">2. In late 1887, James Gordon Bennett,
      Jr., editor of the <em>New York Herald</em>, invited Whitman to
      contribute a series of poems and prose pieces for the paper. From December 1887
      through August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems appeared.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00518_n5">3. Bucke is referring to
      Whitman's postal card of .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00518_n3">4. At some point, Bucke's
      closing and the signature on his letter were cut away. Bucke did, however,
      include a postscript on the verso of his letter, which he signed with his
      initials. The postscript, which is struck through, can be found in the right
      margin of the top half of Whitman's draft of "The Wallabout Martyrs," on the
      verso of Bucke's letter.<a href="#r4">[back]
