   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07336_n2">2. On  Bucke wrote of "the John Hopkins Hospital.
      Walt, if I were in your fix I would think seriously of going there for the next
      six months or a year . . . as a private patient. . . . I do not suppose the
      expence would be much more than the present subsidy but if it is we can easily
      get more money." See Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in

   <p id="n0615">4. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4113">6. William Thomas Stead
      (1849–1912) was a well-known English journalist and editor of <em>The Pall Mall Gazette</em> in the 1880s. He was a proponent of
      what he called "government by journalism" and advocated for a strong press that
      would influence public opinion and affect government decision-making. His
      investigative reports were much discussed and often had significant social
      impact. He has sometimes been credited with inventing what came to be called
      "tabloid journalism," since he worked to make newspapers more attractive to
      readers, incorporating maps, illustrations, interviews, and eye-catching
      headlines. He died on the <em>Titanic</em> when it sank in
      1912.<a href="#r6">[back]
