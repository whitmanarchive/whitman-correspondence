      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother &amp; Sister
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will just write you a line to let you know I am all right—I sent you a N Y paper the <em>Sun</em> of to-day with an acc't of the funeral<sup><a href="#wwh.00012_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am feeling pretty well for me—am stopping with Mr Johnston and his wife &amp; family—there
      is a big family &amp; they have moved up here in 5th Avenue—very grand—a big four or five
      story house, near 86th St overlooking the Park, cool &amp; fresh as can be—all are very
      kind, especially Mrs J. (the new one)—the children all call me Uncle Walt—the baby
      is bright &amp; interesting, but not rugged—(I hardly think its tenure of life secure)<sup><a href="#wwh.00012_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I have many invitations, but don't accept them—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have seen John Burroughs &amp; he wants me to go up there to Esopus, but I don't think
      I shall go<sup><a href="#wwh.00012_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I find my gray clothes very seasonable here, as it is cool enough all the time except
      at mid-day—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose Hattie and Jessie are there, all right<sup><a href="#wwh.00012_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—Dear girls, I send you my best love, &amp; I will soon be home &amp; see you—I will finish
      to-night—

   <p>I finish my letter here—having had a very pleasant 3 hours trip up here on the "Plymouth
      Rock," to Mr &amp; Mrs John Bigelow's (he was U S minister to France)<sup><a href="#wwh.00012_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—I met her at Mr. Bryant's funeral &amp; she invited me up here—I came up for the sail,
      as well as to see the good folks &amp; this beautiful spot—I think it the finest I have
      ever seen—Had dinner about an hour ago, and in about an hour more, shall return on
      the boat—Shall get to N Y before sundown.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The weather is perfect—I am feeling all right—shall probably mail this to you when
      I get in to-night—Hope you are all well &amp;c—

   <p>I was so tired out &amp; got in so late from the West Point trip that I did not go to
      mail this last night—At present I am sitting alone in the front parlor with the Park
      opposite like a dense woods—is pleasant, but cloudy &amp; <em>almost cold</em> to-day—(if I had not my old grays wearing I should be uncomfortable)—Lou, you would
      like the folks &amp; everything here—especially Mrs Johnston—at meals there is a great
      big table &amp; the little children sit up the same as any—toward the last the baby &amp;
      the little 4 year old girl are generally down crawling around on the floor—the whole
      squad are model children lively &amp; free &amp; <em>children</em>, but no bother &amp; no whimpering or quarreling at all under any circumstances—they
      form a great part of my comfort here—Yesterday was such a strain that to-day I [am]
      going to keep still—Best love to you all—I enclose a card—write me about the girls
      &amp; all—
