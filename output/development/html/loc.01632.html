      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope you will be able to come, as you said in your last—If I knew when &amp; where you
      would arrive 
      in Philadelphia, I would try to meet you—As I wrote you before<sup><a href="#loc.01632_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> you must come to Market st. ferry Philadelphia, a mile and half, 
      or 2 miles from RR depot, &amp; cross over by boat to Federal st Camden—(The Phil. horse cars run Sundays—run down to foot of Market st—but the Camden ones do <u>not</u>—but it is not very far from the ferry in Camden.)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am very much the same—My being disabled &amp; want of Exercise for 16 months, (and many
      other wants too,) 
      have saddled me with serious dyspepsia &amp; what the doctor calls gastric catarrh, very
      obstinate, 
      causing me really more suffering &amp; pain than my paralysis—but though I have bad spells
      enough, 
      thank God I also have middling good ones—&amp; as I write this have just had my dinner,
      nice salt oysters, 
      raw, fresh &amp; am feeling quite comfortable—Dear son, I shall look for you

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01632_n3">1. This letter is addressed:
      Pete Doyle | M street South | bet 4½ &amp; 6th | Washington | D. C. It is
      postmarked: Philadelphia | May | 22 | Pa.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01632_n1">2. The year is verified by
      the references to his catarrh, to "want of exercise for 16 months," and to
      Doyle's impending visit, which evidently took place a few days later (see the
      letter from Whitman to Doyle of ).<a href="#r2">[back]
