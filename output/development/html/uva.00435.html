   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00435_n1">1. The year is confirmed by
      the notes below. Whitman was at the office of <em>The Critic</em>
      on August 3 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
      He undoubtedly was returning the corrected proof of "Spirit That Form'd This
      Scene," which appeared in <em>The Critic</em> on September 10.
      After the poem was rejected by <em>The North American Review</em>,
      Whitman sent it on May 28 to Jeannette Gilder, who paid him $5 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00435_n2">2. Whitman left the home of
      Edgar Smith on August 6, and stayed with his old friend until August 19, when he
      went to Boston (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Johnston's summer home was at Mott
      Avenue and 149th Street. Whitman described Mott Haven in the New York <em>Tribune</em> on August 15 in "City Notes in August."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00435_n3">3. The announcement of
      Whitman's new edition appeared in <em>The Critic</em> on August
      13: "Walt Whitman's poems will soon have the recognition of a well-known
      publishing house. James R. Osgood &amp; 
      Co.
      
       will publish 'Leaves of Grass' without any expurgations, the author
      having made that a condition of his contract. The book will contain many new
      poems, and will for the first time fulfil what Mr. Whitman says has been for
      years his main object in relation to the publication of his works—namely,
      'completeness and relative proportion.'"<a href="#r3">[back]
