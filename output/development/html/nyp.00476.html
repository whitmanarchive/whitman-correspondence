   <p>Have just been looking over the "Transfer" pamphlet you sent—pages 46, '7, to
      which you call'd my attention are (I allow myself to think) a latent flattering
      unction to me &amp; the ways I suggest of looking at questions in America.<sup><a href="#nyp.00476_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Indeed such things do me more good than you think
      for—I am just going over to Germantown to spend to-night, to-morrow &amp; till
      Thursday noon in the big family &amp; big house, wife, son, two splendid daughters
      of a Quaker friend, whose carriage comes for me presently.<sup><a href="#nyp.00476_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> The eldest daughter, age 20, an admirer of L. of G. who comes up even to you.<sup><a href="#nyp.00476_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> Thanks for the MS.—(as I write, has not yet
      arrived but will be here soon no doubt)—You shall see the proof—all your
      wishes shall be followed.

   <p>I am curious to see the Carlyle-Emerson letters—(had not heard before about my
      being in them)<sup><a href="#nyp.00476_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—You hit long ago on the reason-why
      of the Emerson (apparent) change, or defection or cloud—whatever it is to be
      call'd—it was the interference, doubtless <em>hard lying</em>,
      of others—there was &amp; is a little knot of my most malignant enemies, <em>deadly haters</em>, in &amp; around Boston—some in high
      quarters—&amp; they plied the man incessantly—Then above all that appears
      or he <em>appears</em> to say—you may be sure that E loved
      me—I believe more than he did any one—he showed it at first, &amp;
      stronger still at <em>last</em>—that Saturday evn'g &amp; Sunday
      afternoon he &amp; I were (mostly silently) together in September, 1881, at Concord,
      told it—told better than ever can be put in words<sup><a href="#nyp.00476_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—

      Life-Saving Transfer is mine—some touches in the others. I was thinking of
      you when I wrote the first and third of my three reasons against transfer" (see

   <p id="nyp.00476_n5">5. According to his letter
      of , O'Connor had read in the New York
      <em>Tribune</em> excerpts from <em>The
         Correspondence of Thomas Carlyle and Ralph Waldo Emerson</em>,
      1834–1872 (1883). He particularly objected to Emerson's reference to
      Whitman in one of the letters (2:251): "The letter, as printed, is very
      characteristic of Emerson—his reserve, his shrinking, like a woman's,
      because of rebuff; his deceptive concessions to the enemy, in a vein of
      pleasantry, almost like irony, almost like a sneer, when he says the book
      'wanted good morals so much' that he did not send it" (Traubel, 1:352). In 1888
      Whitman agreed with O'Connor: "Emerson should have said yes or no—not
      yes-no" (Traubel, 1:353).<a href="#r5">[back]
