   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Little is known about Harry
      D. Hughes, but as an envelope with Hughes' address ("3343 North 21th street /
      Philadelphia / Pa") is extant from March 21, 1888, Whitman might have written to
      Hughes again at this point or perhaps even met him in person. Hughes was also an
      author, who published <em>Romances and Studies</em>, a small
      volume of essays and sketches, in 1889 (Philadelphia: Ideal Publishing
      Company).
