   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wrote Bart Bonsall a note yesterday about getting you a situation, &amp; stopt there
      ab't noon to see him to-day—but they told me he was away &amp; would not be back to-day—There is no news to write—all goes on pretty much the same with me—Harry, I send
      you a couple of to-day's papers—Things rather dull with me—I am only middling well—(have probably banged
      around too much the last three months &amp; too much excitement)—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00410_n1">1. The envelope for this letter
      bears the address: Harry L Stafford | Kirkwood | Camden County | New Jersey. It
      is postmarked: Camden | Aug | 15 | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00410_n2">2. On August 14, Whitman
      applied for a situation for Harry Stafford to Bartram Bonsall, coeditor of the
      <em>Camden Daily Post</em> with his father, Henry Lummis
      Bonsall. Henry established the <em>Camden New Republic</em> after
      the Civil War and later founded the <em>Post</em>, which he sold
      to his son in 1883; see George R. Prowell, <em>The History of
         Camden County </em> (Philadelphia: L.J. Richards &amp; Co., 1886),
      325–326. Harry began to work at Haddonfield, N.J., about August 20, either
      for a newspaper or in a printing plant (see the letter from Whitman to Edward
      Carpenter of ). Probably Whitman
      was seeking a position for Harry when he wrote on October 9 to William Taylor,
      the editor of the Woodstown (N.J.) <em>Constitution</em>
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On
      November 13 Whitman noted that Harry was at "Atco," but after his visit on
      December 31, the poet wrote in his Commonplace Book: "has left Atco."<a href="#r2">[back]

      from August 17, Saturday, to August 20 (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r3">[back]
