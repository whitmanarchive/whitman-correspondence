      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Binckley,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In reference to the brief conversation between us a few days since, allow me in
      candor to say, that I should decidedly prefer to retain my present post as Record
      Clerk, the duties of which I feel that I can fulfil properlyâ€”&amp; that I
      would therefore, as far as my personal choice is concerned, wish to be <em>not</em> thought of in view of the pardon clerkship.<sup><a href="#loc.01577_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Only in case of <em>urgent wish</em> on your or Mr. Browning's part,
      would I deem it my duty to waive the preference mentioned, &amp; obey your commands.
   </p>

      This draft letter is endorsed, "March 24 | '68 | Note to Mr. Binckley." <br><br>
      The numerous changes made in this draft indicate that Whitman struggled to
      phrase his refusal tactfully.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.01577_n3">2. Binckley replied on the
      same day: "Your wishes admit of easy compliance, since Mr Browning has resolved
      to make a vacancy of the post of pardon clerk." See Binckley's  letter to Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
