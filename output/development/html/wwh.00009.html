      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Jeff<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n0710" id="r1">1</a></sup>,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just rec'd your letter, &amp; glad indeed to hear directly from you all. I hear
      through mother<sup><a href="#n0705" id="r2">2</a></sup>, but have been expecting a letter from Mat<sup><a href="#n0707" id="r3">3</a></sup> now for some time—Mother's letters are almost always mentioning
      Matty with love &amp; sympathy, &amp; fretting when she 
      dont
      
       hear from her—Dear Mat, we all love her so much, &amp; think about her more
      than she knows—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am now working in another branch of the Department—have it easier—whenever
      you write direct to me—"<em>Solicitor's Office, Treasury</em>"
      Washington, D. C.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just written a letter to Han<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I write quite often, &amp;
      send papers, &amp;c—I shall write to mother this morning—Mother is quite alone
      there in the house, as the people down stairs<sup><a href="#wwh.00009_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> have moved
      out—(George turned 'em out for impudence to mother)—I write every other day,
      &amp; send papers &amp; stuff—My next piece is to appear in the "<em>Kansas Magazine</em>" for February<sup><a href="#wwh.00009_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup>—will be out very
      shortly—It is a new magazine, same style as the Atlantic—intended for <em>Western thought</em> &amp; reminiscences &amp;c—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear Brother, &amp; dear Sister Matty, I should like to come on, according to your
      invitation, &amp; pay you a good visit, but it is doubtful this time—My bringing out a
      new book is only bringing out a new edition, from the stereotype plates, the same
      as the
      last—only in one Vol—as the edition printed a year ago is all
      exhausted—(But I stereotyped it, &amp; have all the plates in New York.) But I should
      like to have a good long visit home, &amp; be with mother—my getting leave does not
      work yet as I hoped—but I expect to fix it somehow, &amp; go home before very
      long—I am very well this winter—My book is flourishing in foreign lands at a
      great rate—I get letters from all parts of Europe—I believe I told you Tennyson
      had written me twice and very hearty &amp; friendly letters, inviting me to come &amp; be
      his guest, &amp;c—Then the professors in the Universities, Dublin &amp; elsewhere in
      Great Britain deliver lectures on "Leaves of Grass"—&amp;c—But <em>here</em> the enemy have the ground mostly to themselves—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you see we have a new Attorney General<sup><a href="#wwh.00009_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup>—It
      doesn't seem to make much difference to me so far—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jeff, did the photos I sent of mother &amp; me come to you, December?</p>
   
   
   <p>Dear sister Mat, &amp; Hatty &amp; California,<sup><a href="#wwh.00009_n4" id="r8">8</a></sup> love to you
      all—I am writing this at my desk, toward noon, very bright &amp; sunny, but cold
      enough—I often think of you all—Mat, when I go home I shall do my part at that
      <em>cake</em> you speak of in letter to mother—Wm. O'Connor<sup><a href="#n0452" id="r9">9</a></sup> &amp; family have gone on a short trip to Cuba, to be back in three
      weeks—They are all well—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother told me the barrel of flour came safe—but it was too bad Mat's Christmas
      letter got lost—
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Good bye to you for this time, Brother Jeff &amp; Matty dear,
      <br></br>Walt.

   <p>Mat, you write to mother often as you can—</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0710">1. Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890), known as
      "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
      eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
      recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
      marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
      correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
      together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Matty) in 1873 and
      his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
      his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!" For
      more on Thomas Jefferson Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0705">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0707">3. Martha Mitchell Whitman (d. 1873) known as "Mattie,"
      was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and
      Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
      the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat
      ailment that would lead to her death in 1873.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0285">4. Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908),
      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="wwh.00009_n1">5. The Stantons, mentioned in Walt Whitman's
       letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="wwh.00009_n2">6. "The Mystic Trumpeter," the <em>Kansas Magazine</em>, 1 (1872), 113–114.
      "Virginia—The West" appeared in the March issue, 1 (1872), 219. For page
      images and transcriptions of the poems as they appeared in the <em>Kansas Magazine</em>, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00143.html">The Mystic Trumpeter</a>" and "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00144.html">Virginia—The West</a>." In December 1872, the journal published
      Richard J. Hinton's "Walt Whitman in Europe" (1 [1872], 499–502), a review
      of European critical comment on Whitman since 1868. Probably Hinton, who was
      well known in Kansas (and whom Whitman mentioned as a "friend" in his  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman), was responsible for the friendliness of the new
      magazine.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="wwh.00009_n3">7. George Henry Williams (1820–1910),
      U.S. Senator from Oregon, served as Attorney General from 1871 to 1875. Williams
      dismissed Walt Whitman on June 30, 1874; Whitman "respectfully acknowledged" his
      dismissal in his  letter to
      Williams.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="wwh.00009_n4">8. Walt Whitman's niece, Jessie
      Louisa.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0452">9. For a time Walt Whitman lived with William D. and
      Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to
      be his close associates during the early Washington years. William Douglas
      O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>,
      an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. He had been an
      assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> before he
      went to Washington. O'Connor was one of Whitman's strongest defenders, most
      notably in his 1866 pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" (a digital version of the
      pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). The poet praised O'Connor in the
      preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was born sample here in the
      19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood.
      Thrice blessed be his memory!" In 1872, while living in the O'Connors' home,
      Whitman strongly disagreed with O'Connor over the Fifteenth Amendment, which
      Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended Whitman's opinion, and in
      response William moved out. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>." <a href="#r9">[back]
