      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is a beautiful quiet Sunday forenoon. I am feeling first rate, &amp; have had quite
      a
      good day so far. After breakfast I went out &amp; sat a long while on the porch in front,
      reading the Sunday paper, enjoying the cool &amp; shade—&amp; besides some real sweet
      music—A young widow next door, a friend of mother's, has been in her parlor the last
      three hours, singing and practising—she has a voice not powerful &amp; ornamental as
      the opera ladies, but with that something, pleasing &amp; tender, that goes to the right
      spot—sings good old hymns &amp; songs—I have enjoyed it greatly—you would
      too—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is now between ½ past 10 &amp; 11—The distant bells are slowly
      ringing—Otherwise it is pretty quiet—The last two hours I have been up here
      reading my proof. I have four or five hours of this every day, which gives me something
      to
      do—an employment like. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, I have just taken out your last letter, &amp; read it over again—I went out on
      a kind of little excursion by myself last night—all alone—It was very pleasant,
      cool enough, &amp; the moon shining—I think of you too, Pete, &amp; a great deal of
      the time—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Tuesday afternoon 9th </p>
   
   
   <p>I was out yesterday a great part of the day on the river to see the yacht race<sup><a href="#loc.01525_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—over a thousand spectator boats, big, little, &amp; middle
      sized—many of them all 
      drest
      
       with flags, bright colored streamers &amp;c. streaming over the green waters,
      beneath the sunshine &amp; bright blue sky—a grand sight—&amp; the beautiful
      yachts &amp; pleasure boats, lots &amp; lots of them, with immense white sails, like great
      wings, tearing along in the breeze—the bay each side alive with people on the
      boats—150,000 people they say—the shores &amp; hills covered for miles
      too—I was out again last night. It was fine—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your welcome letter of the 8th has come this morning, dear loving son, &amp; has pleased
      me, as always. That accident on the bridge was indeed terrible<sup><a href="#loc.01525_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—that bridge is a disgrace to Washington, any how—Pete, I wish you to tell Mr.
      &amp; Mrs. Nash<sup><a href="#loc.01525_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; your cousin, &amp; all, I send them my
      best respects—Also Henry Hurt<sup><a href="#n0321" id="r4">4</a></sup>—also Andy Woolridge<sup><a href="#loc.01525_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> on 7th st—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Wednesday afternoon 10th—</p>
   
   <p>Dear son, yours of 9th came this forenoon—I feel quite unhappy about your bad luck
      again—reported by some damned fool, &amp; taken off by a worse damned fool—But
      you keep a good heart, Pete—school will keep some how—I have no room to write
      more at present—Dear loving son, I want to keep writing frequently. 
   </p>

      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p><em>just going out</em>—Bub, just in the nick of time before I sealed
      this letter, as I had finished dressing to go out, mother sung out to me from the
      foot of
      the stairs—&amp; I got your good welcome third letter. Pete, you are doing
      first-rate. I guess Pleasants<sup><a href="#loc.01525_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup> was after something stronger
      than Kissengen<sup><a href="#loc.01525_n6" id="r7">7</a></sup>—Tell Dr. Milburn<sup><a href="#loc.01525_n7" id="r8">8</a></sup> I 
      dont
      
       find any place in N. Y. or Brooklyn to compare with his, for the mineral
      drinks—But I am living more to suit me in the grub line, this weather—not so
      much meat—mother's cookery, &amp; quite a good deal of fruit &amp;c.—A lovely 
      broil'd
      
       steak &amp; perfect coffee this morning—I wish you had been on hand, young
      man—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01525_n1">1. The Queen's Cup Race, mentioned in Walt
      Whitman's  letter to Doyle,
      was held off Staten Island on August 8, 1870. The <em>Dauntless</em> finished second, the <em>America</em> fourth,
      and the <em>Cambria</em> eighth. On August 9, 1870, the New York
      <em>Times</em> observed: "The contest was probably attended by
      more public and wide-spread enthusiasm than any American sporting event that has
      ever occurred, either on land or water."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01525_n2">2. The Washington <em>Daily
         Morning Chronicle</em> of August 7, 1870, noted an accident on the
      Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad at White Sulphur Springs, Greenbrier County, West
      Virginia, in which twelve people were killed.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01525_n3">3. Mr. and Mrs. Michael Nash, Washington
      friends to whom Walt Whitman referred frequently in his letters to Doyle. Mr.
      Nash was an old resident of the city; Walt Whitman's  letter to Doyle made mention of a speech Nash gave
      to the Oldest Inhabitants' Association.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0321">4. Henry Hurt, like Peter Doyle, worked for the
      Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company. According to the Washington <em>Chronicle</em> of January 15, 1874, at that time Hurt was the
      treasurer of the company.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01525_n4">5. Probably Andrew J. Wooldridge (not
      Woolridge), listed as a druggist in 1873.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01525_n5">6. Chief clerk in Walt Whitman's office
      (mentioned in Walt Whitman's 
      letter to Andrew Kerr). Pleasants resigned as chief clerk in the Pardons Office
      in 1871; Whitman named him as "late Chief Clerk" in his  letter to Amos Tappan Akerman. According to Charles
      W. Eldridge's letter to John Burroughs on June 26, 1902, Pleasants was "now, as
      he has been for many years," clerk of the United States Circuit Court at
      Richmond, Virginia (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection of English and
      American Literature, New York Public Library).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01525_n6">7. A mineral water.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01525_n7">8. J. P. Milburn &amp; Co., druggists:
      "Proprietors and Manufacturers of Milburn's Unrivaled Polar Soda Water."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
