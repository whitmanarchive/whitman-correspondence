      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was thinking 
      to day
      
       whether I had answered your last letter or not but I am going to write you
      anyhow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The most news at present is
      about the high water of which we have plenty &amp; to spare even to the big folks at
      Washington if they need any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The weather is warm and spring is fairly advanced people are
      plowing &amp; wheat looks first rate although I am not interested in agriculture I
      am glad to see things 
      thriving. I have been engaged in the oil business the last year but I find it a
      losing game and now I am out of employment and floating around &amp; it is hard to
      tell when I shall turn up &amp; whether it will be upside down or right side up If I
      had known in time I might possibly have got the nomination for Governor of this
      state but ex Gov. Helm has beat me.
      That you know would have been better than lying around idle. Now I must look for
      something else for a living. I might steal if I knew enough but I have not even the
      first  rudiments of the
      profession and then it leads to unpleasant things when one gets caught at it I think
      of going to Nashville this week and can see if I can get
      work there something from blacking boots down to
      sweeping crossings I think if Gov Brownlow knew me he would not
      hesitate to give me a good berth in Tennessee but being of
      a modest disposition of course I cannot call his attention to my many merits&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Now you must not think I am egotistical at
      all for I am not I am only telling you what most every one knows [
      <span class="unclear">as knows?</span>]
       anything [
      <span class="unclear">about me?</span>]
      
       It's Sunday evening
      I'm [
      <span class="unclear">sitting?</span>]
       alone sad
      &amp; lonely, [
      <span class="unclear">not a dog

       love no one to talk with Time hangs [
      <span class="unclear">heavily?</span>]
       and [
      <span class="unclear">yet?</span>]
       they say time flees [
      <span class="unclear">quickly?</span>]
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Ah it may be I [
      <span class="unclear">have?</span>]
       seen the time when [
      <span class="unclear">minutes?</span>]
       were [
      <span class="unclear">hours and?</span>]
       days but that is
      [
      <span class="unclear">gone?</span>]
       yes 
      its
      
       near [

      <span class="unclear">re
         past And?</span>]
       May God in his mercy deliver us from the curse of war where
      so many meet their death or are thr[
      <span class="unclear">own?</span>]

      <span class="unclear">poor miserable?</span>]
