      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother George
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Enclosed I send you draft on New York no. 5104, for five hundred and ten dollars<sup><a href="#loc.00450_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—the ten you will please give to Mother as a present from Mattie
   </p>
   
   <p>We are getting along abt the same as usual. Mat still has a bad cough—yet I hardly think it as bad as it was
      a few weeks ago. I should'nt wonder if she and Jessie made you a visit in the course of a month or so<sup><a href="#loc.00450_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &nbsp;The doctor told Mat yesterday that he thought a visit east would do her cough more
      good than anything else—and if that is the case I am anxious that she should go. Tell
      Mammy not to commence to worry about it yet though for perhaps she may not be afflicted.
   </p>
   
   <p>How are you getting along with your new house<sup><a href="#loc.00450_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—well I hope &nbsp;Is there much building in B[rooklyn] this year—in St. Louis there are
      more houses going up this year than ever before—some 2500 dwelling houses are reported
      in process of construction.
   </p>
   
   <p>What is the news about the water works office—I find every body there as tight as
      a bottle in the way of writing &nbsp;I suppose they must take their cue from Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00450_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I wish you would drop me a line telling me what news there is—did you go to Phillipsburgh<sup><a href="#loc.00450_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—and if so what did you see
   </p>
   
   <p>I see by the papers that you have had some pretty bad rain storms in Brooklyn—we have
      lately had two storms that has put us back on the work very much indeed—the contractors
      were not prepared for them and so were damaged a good deal &nbsp;We have had a pretty severe
      storm this morning—but nothing like the others.
   </p>
   
   <p>I understand you were down to Woods at Florence<sup><a href="#loc.00450_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &nbsp;did you see our 36" pipe and if so what did you think of them—
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you think you will continue to live in Atlantic street this winter—or do you think
      you will "move" as mother has been talking about for the last year or two—and by the
      way when do you expect Walt home—
   </p>
   
   <p>How are political matters about Brooklyn—Seymour<sup><a href="#loc.00450_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> I suppose will be ahead just in and about New York City but will he carry the state
      do you think—The only thing that will save this state to Grant—if it is saved—will
      be the "iron clad oath"<sup><a href="#loc.00450_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> &nbsp;The rebs are, I judge, in the majority here—but they dont allow many of them to
      register and when they do do it they have to do some pretty tall swearing. I took
      the oath 'tother day—as I want to vote for Grant—all the other questions though I think I shall leave
      out<sup><a href="#loc.00450_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> &nbsp;Write me and tell me all the news in and about Brooklyn—Love to Mother and all—

   <p id="loc.00450_n2">2. When her doctors
      sugggested a change of air, Mattie went to Brooklyn with her two daughters on
      October 14 and lived with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman until mid-December. Jeff
      joined his family around November 20 (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1977], p. 60). Despite her poor health, Mattie did little to
      ease the strain on her throat. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman informed Walt Whitman
      on November 11 that the doctor had "performed two moderate operations on her
      throat &nbsp;but O dear if you could hear her talk &nbsp;it would make me hoarse to talk a
      steady stream as she does when any one comes in to see her" (Trent Collection of
      Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections
      Library).<a href="#r2">[back]

      George's difficulties in building this three-story house for his mother and
      brother Edward, see Jerome M. Loving, ed., <em>Civil War Letters
         of George Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press,
      1975), pp. 28-29. Located at 107 N. Portland Avenue, this was Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's last home in Brooklyn.<a href="#r3">[back]

      at Florence, New Jersey, was a major supplier of iron pipe for the St. Louis
      Water Works (<em>Proceedings of the City Council</em>, St. Louis,
      June 23, 1868).<a href="#r6">[back]

      carried New York state by a bare ten thousand votes.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00450_n8">8. The Missouri state
      constitution of 1865 required that all citizens take a stringent loyalty oath
      before they could register to vote, thus effectively disfranchising many
      ex-Confederates and their sympathizers. This controversial oath, one of the
      strictest in the nation, was repealed in 1870. Despite Jeff's fears, Grant
      carried Missiouri by a wide margin.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00450_n9">9. One of these
      "questions" was a proposal to enfranchise black citizens. The measure, which had
      lost the year before in Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio, was rejected
      three to two.<a href="#r9">[back]
