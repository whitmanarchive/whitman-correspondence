      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I had the honor to recive the fiew lines you addressed to me, which was delivered by my particular friend Bush through
      whose instrumentality I am doubtless indebted for this kind and highly appreciated
      favor from you.<sup><a href="#tex.00142_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>In my humble opinion there is nothing so well calculated to inspire a soldier with
      new courage and fresh detirmanation and fit him for the performance of his duty under all circumstances; as the assurance
      that he has the sympathy and friendship of the aged, who by the infirmaties of age
      are rendered unfit and incapable of sharing his hard life but are ever ready and willing
      when occasion offers to extend a word of friendly greeting and bid him God speed
   </p>
   
   <p>Then kneed I tell you that <em>your</em> friendship is most cordialy accepted and mine freely and cheerfuly given in return with the hope that this partial acquaintance may ripen into a mutual
      attachment
   </p>
   
   <p>The preasent you sent me I received for which accept my profound thanks   With the hope of hearing
      from you soon I'll close Yours Truly
   </p>
