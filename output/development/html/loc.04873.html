   <p>I have been going for two weeks to write special letters of thanks &amp;c to you
      &amp; T D<sup><a href="#syr.00024_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> for your kindness &amp; labors in my lecture, and raising in it, $674 for
      me—I appreciate all, <u>&amp; indeed thank you</u>—It
      is the biggest stroke of pure kindness &amp; concrete help I have ever
      rec'd—But all formal letters must just fizzle down to this card—whose
      duplicate I send to T D—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Talcott Williams
      (1849–1928) was associated with the New York <em>Sun</em>
      and <em>World</em> as well as the Springfield <em>Republican</em> before he became the editor of the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in 1879. His newspaper vigorously defended Whitman
      in news articles and editorials after the Boston censorship of 1882. For more
      information about Williams, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_108.html">Williams, Talcott (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="syr.00024_n3">2. Thomas Donaldson
      (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
      introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
      the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
      carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt
         Whitman, the Man</em> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see
