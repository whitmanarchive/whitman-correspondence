   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07663_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr R M Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden,
      N.J. | Sep 13 | 8 PM | 88.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07662_n4">2. Whitman is referring to
      James Anthony Froude's <em>Thomas Carlyle; A History of His Life
         in London, 1834–1881</em> (1884).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07663_n2">3. Bucke replied on : "No I would not recommend
      Froude's Carlyle to a man who needed cheering up. I read it a few years ago and
      it nearly gave me an attack of melancholia. I look upon that same Carlyle as
      being (or having been?) one of the worst 'Cranks' that ever lived. . . . I shall
      like to know C. by &amp; by to see what he is like in the next world but I never
      expect to care much about him!" On September 14, 1888, William Ingram wrote to
      Bucke that Whitman "looked bright &amp; cheerful and in good spirits." Bucke
      continued in his letter of :
      "Still it is grand to see you keep up as you do—never giving up to the
      last—I think it is immense, something for us all to be proud of and to
      take to heart—and the world will take all this to heart one day—and
      will be the better for it."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0323">4. William Ingram, a Quaker, kept a tea
      store—William Ingram and Son Tea Dealers–in Philadelphia. Of Ingram,
      Whitman observed to Horace Traubel: "He is a man of the Thomas Paine
      stripe—full of benevolent impulses, of radicalism, of the desire to
      alleviate the sufferings of the world—especially the sufferings of
      prisoners in jails, who are his protégés" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.53.html">Sunday, May 20, 1888</a>).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1043">5. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07663_n3">6. Stedman sent the proofs
      to Traubel on September 8 (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.59.html">Tuesday, September 11, 1888</a>). The article appeared in volume seven of
      <em>A Library of American Literature</em>,
      501–513.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6113">7. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_92.html">Davis, Mary Oakes (1837 or 1838–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07663_n4">8. Harry Fritzinger (about
      1866–?) was the brother of Warren Fritzinger, who would serve as Whitman's
      nurse beginning in October 1889. Harry worked as an office boy in Camden when he
      was fourteen and, later, he became a railroad conductor. Mary Davis, Whitman's
      housekeeper, took care of both Harry and Warren after the death of their father,
      the sea captain Henry W. Fritzinger. Davis had looked after Capt. Fritzinger,
      who was blind, before she started to perform the same housekeeping services for
      Whitman.<a href="#r8">[back]
