   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00600_n14">1. This letter dates to
      between May 17, 1870 and June 12, 1870, and it more likely dates to early
      June. The letter has no date in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard
      Maurice Bucke conjectured August 1870, but his month is incorrect. Edwin
      Haviland Miller conjectured June? 1870 (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:98, n. 20; 2:368), and Miller's date is corroborated
      partially by Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's receipt and response to Anne
      Gilchrist's "A Woman's Estimate of Walt Whitman." However, a number of
      contextual factors allow the letter to date as early as May 17, 1870 and no
      later than June 12, 1870.<br><br>
      Walt Whitman traveled to Brooklyn in late April or early May, and from there
      he made a request to William D. O'Connor in Washington D.C.: "If the
      'Radical' has come, send me a copy immediately" (see Walt's  letter to O'Connor). Walt also
      informed O'Connor that he expected to return to Washington "next Monday"
      (May 16). Louisa may have received O'Connor's forwarded copy of the <em>Radical</em> just before or after Walt's return to
      Washington, but it is more probable that Walt sent a copy of Gilchrist's
      article to his mother after his return. Walt also forwarded a copy of
      Gilchrist's article to his brother-in-law Charles Heyde, and Heyde responded
      in a  letter to Walt. The date of
      Louisa's receipt of Gilchrist's article and the date of Heyde's letter
      establish the outer range of possible dates for this letter. Another detail
      that may narrow the range of dates is that Heyde wrote of wife Hannah
      (Whitman) Heyde that a "swelling in her neck has subsided," and in this
      letter Louisa relays Heyde's report from a letter (not extant) that Hannah
      "has a swelling on the side of her face and ear has been three weeks that it
      pains her." Though the calendar dates during which Hannah suffered the pain
      in her neck and face cannot be established with certainty, Louisa's letter
      must precede Heyde's June 13 response to Gilchrist's article. Louisa's
      letter also indicates that she received a letter from Heyde in response to
      the one that she "wrote [Hannah] last week," and Heyde may acknowledge
      receipt of that same letter.<br><br>
      The earliest possible date for this letter is the second day after Walt's May
      16 departure: because Louisa has received copies of Gilchrist's article two
      days in succession, May 17, 1870 is the earliest possible date. The letter
      dates no later than a day before Heyde responded to Gilchrist's article,
      June 12, 1870.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00600_n1">2. Walt Whitman cut his thumb
      in late April or early May 1870, and it became infected. He referred to the
      injury in two letters from Brooklyn, a  letter to Walbridge A. Field and a second  letter to William D. O'Connor. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      inquired about or expressed concern for Walt's thumb in this and five other
      letters to Walt from May or June to July 1870: , , , , and .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00600_n13">3. Walt Whitman and his friend
      William D. O'Connor played an active role in the publication of "A Woman's
      Estimate of Walt Whitman," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870),
      345–359. The Boston <em>Radical</em> was a Unitarian
      periodical edited by Sidney H. Morse (1833–1903). Gilchrist's "Woman's
      Estimate" was based on letters that Gilchrist wrote to William Michael Rossetti
      after he edited for publication <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/books/other/rossetti.html"><em>Poems by Walt Whitman</em></a> (London: Hotten,
      1868). According to Jerome M. Loving, Rossetti encouraged Gilchrist to have her
      enthusiastic letters published and forwarded them to William D. O'Connor.
      O'Connor initially contacted William C. Church and Francis P. Church, editors of
      the <em>Galaxy</em>. After they rejected Gilchrist's piece,
      O'Connor submitted it to the <em>Radical</em> (see <em>Walt Whitman's Champion</em> [College Station: Texas A&amp;M
      University Press, 1978], 92–93).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00600_n15">4. Anne Gilchrist's "A Woman's
      Estimate of Walt Whitman" was published anonymously. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      immediately recognized Gilchrist's analysis—she "seems to understand your
      writing better than ever any one did before"—as one of the first great
      critical readings of Whitman's work. For more on Gilchrist, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00469_n13">5. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a French-born landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa
      Whitman (1823–1908), Walt Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington,
      Vermont. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive
      letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman often spoke
      disparagingly of Heyde in her letters to Walt: "i had a letter or package from
      charley hay three sheets of foolscap paper and a fool wrote on them" (see her
       to Walt).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00559_n12">6. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., resided in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles L.
      Heyde.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">7. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00600_n2">8. Moses Lane (1823–82)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to May 1, 1869.
      After his resignation from Brooklyn, Lane worked in Chicago and contributed to
      the design of the Pittsburgh Water Works. Lane later designed and constructed
      the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city engineer ("Moses Lane," <em>Proceedings of the American Society of Civil Engineers</em>
      [February 1882], 58).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00600_n5">9. Walt Whitman seems to have
      ended his boarding arrangement with Mr. and Mrs. Newton Benedict at 472 M Street
      South with his departure from Washington after suffering the injury to his thumb
      in late April or early May 1871. Based on this letter, he did not return to the
      Benedict household during July. Whatever arrangement Walt made was short-term:
      he returned to Brooklyn in late July for a furlough that would extend through
      mid-October.<a href="#r9">[back]
