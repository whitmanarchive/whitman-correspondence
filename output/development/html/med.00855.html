      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am still here neither worse nor better—but keeping in my sick room &amp; in
      the big old chair—have had something to see to in printing my books &amp; it
      has probably done me more good than harm—&amp; it all (the printing) has gone
      on &amp; is going on satisfactorily—Herbert<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> has arrived
      all right &amp; is stopping over in Philadelphia—quite busy—he is to
      have a studio there &amp; paint—rather thinks (but it has not yet been settled
      definitely) he has secured a studio already—He has been over to see me—a
      short visit this time—He looks hearty &amp; handsome, red &amp; fat &amp;
      first rate—he will come down before long &amp; see you &amp; then tell you
      more fully his plans—wh' he did not to-day—but I believe he thinks
      stopping, working &amp; painting here for a year to come—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have not heard from any of you for quite a while—send me word how things
      are—tell me abt Debbys<sup><a href="#n0844c" id="r3">3</a></sup> baby<sup><a href="#med.00855_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      &amp; everything—George<sup><a href="#n0852c" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; Harry,<sup><a href="#loc.03930_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> as far as you know—&amp; how are you
      yourself—I am sitting here alone up in my room, writing this—Mrs:
      Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r7">7</a></sup> has been an hour or two ago out to the City Hall to
      pay my taxes (over $34)<sup><a href="#med.00855_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup>—&amp; some thief there
      stole a nice valuable silk sun umbrella from her—gone—Hope this will
      find you well—&amp; God bless all—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).
