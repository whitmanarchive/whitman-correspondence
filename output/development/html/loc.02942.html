   <p>C'est A great moment at last this April 22, (88) Sund. Eve (I free from the
      gnarring of the [

       at my heels).
      Your <u>very interesting</u> letters 
      rec'd
      
       &amp; forwarded.
   </p>
   
   <p>Last night I saw Bronson Howard's<sup><a href="#n4257" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      play—Henrietta—Robson &amp; Crane<sup><a href="#n4258" id="r3">3</a></sup> chief actors. A
      very useful play—satire on Wall Street.
   </p>
   
   <p>Matthew Arnold's<sup><a href="#loc.05536_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> article on America in the April
      Nineteenth Century<sup><a href="#loc.02942_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> you ought to read. He's as insolent &amp; haughty toward us
      (amusingly so) as all other Englishmen. They are getting afraid of us—to tell
      the truth?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      popular theatrical duo that lasted twelve years. Productions such as <em>Our Bachelors</em> (1878) and <em>Sharps and
         Flats</em> (1880) were so successful that Bronson Howard's <em>The Henrietta</em> (1887) was written specifically for them. For more on

      critic Matthew Arnold (1822–1888) first came to America on a lecture tour
      in October, 1883, and remained until March, 1884. He "returned to England
      confirmed by experience in his conception of the average American as a hard
      uninteresting type of Philistine." After a second trip to the United States in
      the summer of 1886, Arnold commented on American life being "uninteresting, so
      without savour and without depth" (Stuart P. Sherman, <em>Matthew
         Arnold</em> [Indianapolis, 1917], 46–49).<a href="#r4">[back]
