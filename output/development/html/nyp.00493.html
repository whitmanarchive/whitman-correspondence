      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of 19th 
      recd.<sup><a href="#nyp.00493_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Thanks for the corrections, &amp; if you
      notice any more errors mention them to me, as I want to make out a full list
      preparatory to next printing—I will speak to McKay 
      ab't
      
       the 25 copies &amp; tell him I will go security—I 
      dont
      
       know of any "office editor" to the <em>N. A.
         Review</em>—I think Allen Thorndike Rice the editor (&amp; owner, 30 Lafayette
      Place New York) keeps every thing (in reading articles, judgment, &amp;c.) in his
      own hands—seems to like controversial articles, attacks, &amp;c.—any
      thing but dulness—yet I 
      sh'd
      
       say is naturally conservative, respectable &amp; English—he pays
      well, when suited—he always paid me well &amp; gave me lots of taffy
      besides—but <em>balked</em> at my Carlyle article (pp. 170 to
      178 <em>Specimen Days</em>) &amp; sent back the MSS.<sup><a href="#nyp.00493_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—A fuller 
      acc't
      
       of that Russian matter<sup><a href="#nyp.00493_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> is in the enclosed,
      wh: after reading, please send back to me. The <em>American</em>
      (same mail with this,) after reading please forward to Dr Bucke. Thanks for the
      Boston <em>Transcript</em> (I have sent it to Dr. B.) If George Edgar
      M[ontgomery]<sup><a href="#nyp.00493_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> keeps on this way he will soon be among
      the avowed &amp; emphatic advocates of 
      L. of G.
      
       The N. Y. <em>Times</em> article of some three weeks since I
      have not yet seen.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am well—have been down all this month at a secluded place I go in the Jersey
      woods<sup><a href="#nyp.00493_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—pleasant weather here now—The
      stress, &amp;c. 
      ab't
      
       Dr Bucke's book will <em>begin next winter</em> here &amp;
      in England.
