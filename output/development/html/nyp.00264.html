      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My brother does not get on quite as well as I had anticipated.<sup><a href="#nyp.00264_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>  Yet I still hold to the judgment in my previous letter. He has been, &amp; is, very
      sick—has had improved spells, &amp; then goes down again. To-day he is in the latter condition.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>William, I received the letter, with Ramsdells note.<sup><a href="#nyp.00264_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> 
      Also Allen's. (Also the first letter soon after my arrival here.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As to Allen,<sup><a href="#nyp.00264_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> refusing &amp;c. giving his views, reasons, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
      it is perhaps one of those services to a thing, (precious, rare 
      &amp; precious, in philosophy, &amp; life too,) rendered by showing not only how that 
      thing appears from the point of view of intensest vermin &amp; filth, exclusively, 
      but of vermin &amp; filth diluted with shallowness to the last degree that life will bear.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If my brother does not get worse, &amp; no crisis takes place, 
      I think, (as at present intending) I shall leave for Washington Wednesday morning
      next.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother is well, (considering). All the rest are first rate. 
      Jeff is in St. Louis. Nelly, I send you my true love, my darling.
      
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00264_n1">1. This letter's envelope
      bears the address, "Wm. D. O'Connor, | Light House Board, | Treasury Department,
      | Washington, | D.C." It is postmarked: "New-York | May | 13."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00264_n3">2. In his  letter to William D. O'Connor, Walt
      Whitman wrote that his brother George was ill with "malignant erysipelas, with
      great swelling, sores, &amp; for a while complete blindness."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00264_n4">3. H. J. Ramsdell was a
      clerk in Washington; in a hospital notebook (Henry E. Huntington Library), Walt
      Whitman called him "chief clerk." In the 1869 Directory, he was listed as a
      correspondent. On , Ramsdell reported
      the high praise that George Townsend, the journalist (1841–1914), accorded
      to Walt Whitman—"a stupendous genius," "the song of a God." In his  letter, he asked Walt Whitman to do
      whatever he could for Judge Milton Kelly, of Idaho, against whom charges had
      been brought by "a very bad man," Congressman Edward D. Holbrook
      (1836–1870). Actually, on July 12, 1867, Walt Whitman had submitted to the
      Attorney General a "Report on the <em>Charges</em> submitted by
      <em>Hon. E. D. Holbrook</em>, Del[egate] from Idaho
      Terr[itory], <em>against</em>
      <em>Hon. Milton Kelly</em>, Asso[ciate] Just[ice] Supreme Court of
      Idaho" (National Archives). To this forty-one page summary of the evidence, all
      in Walt Whitman's hand, there is appended a letter signed by Stanbery but
      written by Walt Whitman, dated July 20, 1867: "The Conclusion in the preceding
      Report is hereby adopted by me, &amp; ordered to stand as the decision of this
      Office in the Case, so far as now presented." On , Ramsdell apologized for his "aggressiveness." (Ramsdell's
      letters are in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) Judge Kelly wrote to
      Walt Whitman on June (?) 21, 1867 (National Archives), and again on . On November 15, 1875, Ramsdell,
      among others, petitioned Benjamin H. Bristow (1832–1896), Secretary of the
      Treasury, that Walt Whitman "be appointed to a position in the Treasury
      Department" (National Archives).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00264_n5">4. On May 9, O'Connor wrote:
      "I enclose a letter I got from that child of a burnt father, Allen…It is
      truly Pecksniffian, and seems to have been written on all-fours. You will see
      that it ends the matter of publishing the book, and he doesn't say a word about
      John Burroughs' book…I think, on the whole, it is probably altogether best
      that Carleton should have nothing to do with 'Leaves of Grass,' though I would
      well enough like to have him publish the 'Notes' " (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.; Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.73.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996],
      3:521–522). George W. Carleton was a New York publisher, and Henry Stanley
      Allen was evidently associated with him, since the 1867 Directory listed them at
      the same business address. In 1864 O'Connor had suggested Carleton as the
      publisher of <em>Drum-Taps</em>; see Trowbridge's  letter to Walt Whitman. In 1865
      O'Connor proposed to George William Curtis (1824–1892) the editor of <em>Harper's Weekly</em>, that he write to Carleton about the
      publication of <em>The Good Gray Poet</em>; see Horace Traubel,
      <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.33.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> (1906–1996), 1:86. Since
      O'Connor was not successful in either attempt, it is surprising that he once
      again sought to interest Carleton in publication schemes. See also Miller, ed.,
      <em>Drum-Taps</em>, xxv.<a href="#r4">[back]
