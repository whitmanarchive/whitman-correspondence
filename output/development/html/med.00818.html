      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman, 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your two postcards are to hand. I expect the printed
      slips to Preface and Additional Note have reached you ere this; I told the
      publishers to forward them. We have taken great pains to make the reprint
      correct—following the American spelling, &amp;c., faithfully. It is all out of
      my hands now, and I do hope everything will turn out well. It has been rather a
      troubled time with me lately, with far too much work on hand to do everything with
      the ample margin for revisal that I like, but all's well that ends well. As there
      was some uncertainty about the process reproduction of that photo, for frontispiece
      or inserted plate, and having the unlucky experience of the portrait in L. of G. to
      go by, we decided to leave the portrait out altogether. Better none at all, as you
      say, than a bad one.
   </p> 
   
   <p>By this post I send a copy of the Pall Mall Gazette with a paragraph taken from the
      Additional Note to the new vol. The P.M.G usually treats me rather cavalierly over
      my own things: the young fellows who do the literary part, and do it capitally
      too—Henry Norman<sup><a href="#loc.00720_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>, O. Wilde<sup><a href="#med.00818_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> and so on—are
      most of them university men, with rather a contempt for unacademic outsiders. In
      the case of this paragraph I got young Horne to propose it to Norman, and so worked
      the oracle. In the same paper, notice the article, Some April Insects, by Richard
      Jefferies.<sup><a href="#med.00818_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I think you will like it. Jefferies is
      one of our best writers on Nature over here; his writing is at once true and subtle,
      and very natural and simple withal. Did you ever read his Story of My Heart? A very
      passionate confession of faith and fear it was, with a sentiment in it that made
      some of the critics say it must be inspired by your L. of G. If you have not yet
      seen it, I should like to send it on. Jefferies is editing the vol. to follow yours
      in the series—White's Selborne. He writes to tell me that he is an invalid,
      poor lover of all things bright and helpful. He lives down in Sussex, near the
      sea.
   </p>
   
   <p>W.S. Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r4">4</a></sup> sent over a fresh batch of addenda for his book. It
      <em>is</em> unfortunate—this delay through Wilson's illness;
      but Kennedy takes it very cheerily. He seems a fine impulsive fellow by his letters.
      In the last one he proposes that I should try some other schemes for getting the
      book afloat. We shall see. This evening Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r5">5</a></sup> is
      coming down here to look through Kennedy's book, and something may suggest itself
      to
      us. We are going on afterwards to Costelloe's, as H.G. is anxious to know Mrs.
      C.,<sup><a href="#n6109" id="r6">6</a></sup> who has been away in Surrey over Easter with her
      husband. I look forward with delight to seeing her again. She is truly a most noble
      and delightful nature. She is a little afraid perhaps of your deterministic theories
      (further elaborated by Doctor Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r7">7</a></sup>) and non-moral apotheosis
      of evil; but that is natural enough. I, too, often doubt any absolute empire, even
      the most cosmic, over the human will: that is my feeling only, for I don't pretend
      to any philosophical complete creed.
   </p>
   
   <p>I was glad to hear of the great success of your Lincoln lecture.<sup><a href="#med.00797_n1" id="r8">8</a></sup> Would that I had
      been there to hear it. I should like to have come over with H. Gilchrist, but cannot
      manage to leave so soon. He will be with you I expect in the course of a few weeks
      more.
   </p>
   
   <p>Are you going up to Doctor Bucke's place for the summer?</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00720_n1">1. Sir Henry Norman
      (1858–1939) was a writer and liberal politican from England. After moving
      to the United States to study at Harvard, he wrote for the <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> and the <em>News
         Chronicle</em>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00818_n3">2. Rhys is referring to the
      Irish playwright and poet Oscar Wilde. Wilde had visited Whitman in Camden three
      years earlier, on January 22, 1882. An account of their meeting appeared on the
      following day in the <em>Philadelphia Press</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00818_n2">3. Richard Jefferies
      (1848–1887) was a British nature writer, who frequently published in the
      <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">4. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">5. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6109">6. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." For more information
      about Costelloe, see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">7. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00797_n1">8. This is referring to
      Whitman's lecture entitled "The Death of Abraham Lincoln." He first delivered
      this lecture in New York in 1879 and would deliver it at least eight other times
      over the succeeding years, delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He
      had published a version of the lecture as "Death of Abraham Lincoln" in <em>Specimen Days</em> (1882–83). For more on the lecture,
      see Larry D. Griffin, "'Death of Abraham Lincoln,'" <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, ed.,
      (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998), 169–170.<a href="#r8">[back]
