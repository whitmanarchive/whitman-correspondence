   <p> I 
      recd
      
       your favor of April 13th and the book, which I'm delighted to have.<sup><a href="#loc.01337_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> Pardon my delay in acknowledging, due to illness. I'm
      delighted to learn that your lecture  and Reading, in the Academy of
      Music, was so great a success.<sup><a href="#loc.01337_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I hope you may repeat it
      for many years to come. Americans are apt to forget their great men, unless their
      work in this world, is kept before their minds, through annual presentations of it.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p> It was a great disappointment to me, when I was last in 
      Philada, that press of work and shortness of time, did not allow me to see you.
      When I next visit the city, I shall certainly arrange to have a talk with you, on
       certain points
      upon which I have been long pondering—one especially, that of
      language-shaping, and the tendency toward impassioned prose, which I feel will
      be the poetic form of the future, and of which, I think, your "Leaves of Grass" is
      the most marked prophecy.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Hiram Corson (1828–1911) was
      a scholar of English literature from Philadelphia, where he taught at Girard
      College. While his studies focused mainly on canonical British texts
      (Shakespeare, Chaucer, etc.), Corson would also give public readings of
      Whitman's verse.
