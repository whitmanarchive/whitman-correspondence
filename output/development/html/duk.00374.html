   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>'Little Mitch,' or Reuben
      Farwell, served with the Michigan Cavalry during the War and met Whitman in
      Armory Square Hospital early in 1864, and upon his release from the hospital he
      corresponded with him. After Farwell received his discharge on August 24, 1864,
      he returned to his home in Plymouth, Michigan. Evidently the correspondence was
      renewed when Whitman sent a post card on February 5, 1875. On March 5, 1875,
      Farwell, who owned a farm in Michigan, wrote: "Walt my dear old Friend how I
      would like to grasp your hand and give you a kiss as I did in the days of yore.
      what a satisfaction it would be to me." In Farwell's last letter, on August 16,
      1875, he said that he was planning to leave shortly for California. Eleven
      letters from Farwell are in the Trent Collection at Duke University. He is also
      mentioned in Whitman's <em>Memoranda During War</em>; Richard
      Maurice Bucke, ed., <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>
      [New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 4:134. The year is confirmed by the
      reference to Farwell's letter of March 5, 1875 (Trent). (For Farwell's
      correspondence with Whitman see ,
