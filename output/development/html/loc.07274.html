   <p>Thank you very much for "Critic" and "American" received today. I quite agree with
      you (in the "Critic") that America has produced several poets (among those who are
      dead) equal to several of the <u>thirteen</u>.<sup><a href="#loc.07274_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> All quiet here—a long letter from William Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r3">3</a></sup> today—all going well with him and the meter but it goes
      slow, slow—looks as if there would never be an end of it—We are having
      here warm, dull,
      muggy weather. All quiet here (not to say dull)
   </p> 
   
   <p>I sent "the second head"<sup><a href="#loc.07274_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> the other day to an Art Loan in
      London—and felt quite dull without it—have got it back again—it is
      looking cheerfully at me now from its bracket in the corner of my office

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4284">3. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
