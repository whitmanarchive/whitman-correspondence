   <p>If I had Hamlin Garland's<sup><a href="#loc.02128_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> address I think I would write
      him a few lines to say how much I admire his calm and pleasant sentences in the
      "Transcript".<sup><a href="#loc.07271_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I do not know when I have read
      anything that pleased me more—not I think since I read O'Connor's<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r4">4</a></sup> letter in the N.Y. Tribune on the Osgood-Stevens affair.<sup><a href="#loc.07271_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> We are coming to the front at last—and shall
      come—I have no fear, no doubt. It is only a question of waiting a few years
      untill men have time to take it in. Another quarter or half century will see L. of
      G. acknowledged to be what it really is—The bible of America.
   </p>
   
   <p>My visit East is likely to be delayed some weeks. We have abt. decided that we will
      not show the meter
      untill it is protected (by patent) in other countries as well as in the States. Wm
      Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r6">6</a></sup> will return here from N.Y.
      almost at once and proceed to Ottawa—arrange there for the Canadian and other
      patents—as soon as these are secured we shall go East. I, of course, cannot
      say how soon this will be but I am in hopes we shall get to Phila immediately after
      Xmas.

   <p>Saw Pardee<sup><a href="#n4274" id="r7">7</a></sup> on Monday he is bad—very sick
      indeed—mind very feeble. Do not hear from O'Connor, do you?<sup><a href="#loc.07267_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I am thinking over something to say about you and L. of G. if I have the chance when
      I am in Phila; impossible to say yet what it will come to,
      if anything.—must only wait and see. It seems to me a long time since I wrote
      you last—I have been in<sup><a href="#loc.07271_n5" id="r9">9</a></sup> a kind of a whirl, better luck in future!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.02128_n1">2. Hamlin Garland
      (1860–1940) was an American novelist and autobiographer, known especially
      for his works about the hardships of farm life in the American Midwest. For his
      relationship to Whitman, see Thomas K. Dean, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_190.html">Garland, Hamlin</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="loc.07271_n2">3. Garland's review of <em>November Boughs</em> appeared in the Boston <em>Transcript</em> on November 15, 1888. He spoke of his review in letters to
      Whitman dated  and . Whitman commented to Horace
      Traubel: "The Transcript piece has as a trifle a certain air almost of apology:
      but for that feature I like it. We are forcing the enemy to listen to us" (see
      Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.17.html">Saturday, November 17, 1888</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n2002">4. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="loc.07271_n3">5. On March 1, 1882,
      Oliver Stevens, the District Attorney of Boston, notified Osgood and Co., the
      publishers of the seventh edition (1881–1882) of <em>Leaves
         of Grass</em>, that Whitman's book was officially classified as obscene and
      was to be suppressed. Stevens wrote: "We are of the opinion that this book is
      such a book as brings it within the provisions of the Public Statutes respecting
      obscene literature and suggest the propriety of withdrawing the same from
      circulation and suppressing the editions thereof" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed.,
      <em>Walt Whitman: The Correspondence</em> [1886–1889], 6
      vols., 4:267 n16; see also Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary
         Singer</em> [1955], 498–500). O'Connor wrote a long letter condemning
      Stevens' ruling; the letter was published as "Suppressing Walt Whitman" in the
      <em>New York Tribune</em> (May 25, 1882).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n4284">6. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
