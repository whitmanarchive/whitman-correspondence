      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received from you lately "The Conservator" with Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      little article<sup><a href="#loc.02099_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>, a newspaper with a review of my Keats,
      your letter of 22 May<sup><a href="#loc.02099_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>, and the parcel by
      express—for all of which I thank you heartily. Your letter came on Monday the
      2nd; &amp; curiously I was going that evening to hear a paper about you read by a
      lady to some thirty or forty people, mostly ladies.<sup><a href="#loc.02099_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      After the paper, which was very sympathetic &amp; intelligently done, I read the
      people your letter and the poem you enclosed. The poem was greatly liked; and the
      message to "British friends" fitted several. I have sent that to the Athenaeum, so
      that all may know how you are going on. The contents of the parcel are delightful
      and will be always prized by me&amp;I mean the photographs and the books in which
      you have written. It seems to me you have sent me, duplicates
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>and all, a great deal for the money. I will let you know the cost of expressage,
      because I presume you wish to keep a check on the agents—it was 7/6 (not very
      dear, I think)—but this is of course my affair; for I make the parcel out to
      come to a good bit over 5..7..6 even in money; and there is much that money will not
      pay for.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Quite by chance I have just taken up at a stall the last part of a serial issue of
      a
      book called "Celebrities of the Century."<sup><a href="#loc.02099_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup> The book was
      issued complete a year or two ago. I contributed the notice of you &amp; several
      others on the distinct understanding that I should say what I pleased. Now they have
      made this reissue without my knowledge, &amp; the conclusion of the article on you
      has been chopped off. I send you the thing as it is now, becuase it may amuse you
      to
      know what an eminently <u>respectable</u> form will publish about
      you in the year 1890. They would not have cut off the end, I fancy, except to make
      room for something else; for they published
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>it all right in the book, which did not contain the notice on the next page, of Sir
      J. Whitworth.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Since receiving your parcel I have heard of something else that I want. It is
      described as "The Family Edition of Specimen Days and Collect,<sup><a href="#loc.02099_n6" id="r7">7</a></sup>—a few copies said to have been extra-illustrated
      &amp; extended in some way. If you had one left I would think it a great favor to be
      allowed to buy it. You might put my name in it &amp; just send a line on a postcard
      to let me know the cost. Some of those photographs you have sent me are really
      splendid—what a fortunate atmosphere! English photographs don't have half the
      sharpness &amp; detail.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Henry "Harry" Buxton
      Forman (1842–1917) was a British man-of-letters, an editor of and
      authority on the works of Keats and Shelley, and, starting in 1887, a
      conspirator in literary forgeries that were exposed after his death. The
      correspondence at this time between Bucke and Forman makes it clear that Bucke
      was also building up Forman's collection of Whitman (D. B. Weldon Library,
      University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario).

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.02099_n2">3. Forman is most likely
