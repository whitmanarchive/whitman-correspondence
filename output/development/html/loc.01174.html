      Dear Walt;
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I was very glad to see that you was able to get down stairs to your thanksgiving dinner,
      &amp;
      I trust you will be able to get down to your Christmas dinner, &amp; to do full justice
      to it. 
      We are dwellers in this town again this winter. Wife hired rooms here 1st of Nov,
      &amp; went to 
      housekeeping. I clung to the farm &amp; lived alone with my dog, coming down here Sundays
      
      &amp; stormy weather. Now the snow has come I
      
      shall probably be here most of the time. I am pretty well, but a good deal troubled.
      The old farm
      where I was born has come back upon my hands &amp; is very embarrassing. I tried to help
      my
      brother through with it, but he has proved unequal to the task &amp; I have had to take
      it to secure
      myself from heavy loss. But I shall lose 8 or 9 hundred dollars in any event &amp; may
      be much more, 
      I go out there again this afternoon. Julian<sup><a href="#loc.01151_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> goes to school &amp; is well, 
      Mrs. B.<sup><a href="#n0892" id="r2">2</a></sup> is pretty well. 
      
   </p>  
   
   <p>
      I had some correspondence this fall with a daughter of Chas.
      Kingsley.<sup><a href="#n0137" id="r3">3</a></sup> She wrote me for a copy of your poems. She is greatly taken with them, 
      but says there are things in them that make her gasp. Her mother, a lady of 80 is
      very enthusiastic 
      over them. She seems to be one of the best readers you ever had. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I suppose a great poet has passed away in Browning.<sup><a href="#n0116" id="r4">4</a></sup> It is curious that I can make nothing of him. His 
      manner always repells me &amp; his matter 
      is not interesting. I trust you keep well as usual &amp; that I shall hear from you soon

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
