      Whitman wrote: "? Under <em>Bits of Criticism</em> | in Sunday <em>Tribune</em> | <em>A defence of Walt
         Whitman</em> | <em>From the Philadelphia Press</em>."
      Immediately below appeared the editorial from the <em>Press</em>
      of May 22. According to Whitman's Commonplace Book, Whitman sent similar letters
      (lost) to the editors of the Boston <em>Herald</em> (see the
      letter from Whitman to William D. O'Connor of ), the Boston <em>Globe</em>, the Boston <em>Post</em>, and to Crosley Stuart Noyes, an old friend and the
      editor of the Washington <em>Evening Star</em> (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839â€“1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). The Camden <em>Daily Post</em> copied
      the article in the <em>Press</em> on May 22. Though the <em>Tribune</em> apparently did not reprint the editorial, it
      published on May 15 Whitman's "Emerson's Books, (the Shadows of them)," which
      appeared in 1880 in <em>The Literary World</em> (see the letter
      from Whitman to John Burroughs of ).
      Whitman was supported, not without reservations in some instances, by the
      following newspapers: the Philadelphia <em>Times</em> on May
      23, the Chicago <em>Inter Ocean</em> on May 22 and 23, the
      Chicago <em>Herald</em> on May 23, the New York <em>Home Journal</em> on May 24, the Boston <em>Liberty</em> and the Cambridge (Mass.) <em>Chronicle</em>
      on May 27, the Boston <em>Globe</em> on May 28, the Audubon
      County (Iowa) <em>Sentinel</em> on May 31(?), and the
      Woodstown (N.J.) <em>Register</em> on June 6. He was attacked,
      often with hysteria, by the following: the Philadelphia <em>Evening Bulletin</em> on May 23, the Boston <em>Daily
         Advertiser</em> on May 24, the Cincinnati <em>Ohio</em> on
      May 24, <em>The Christian Intelligencer</em> (quoted in the
      New York <em>Tribune</em> on June 4), and the Philadelphia <em>Times</em> on July 17. For the Springfield <em>Republican</em> and the Boston <em>Herald</em>, see the letter from Whitman to O'Connor of ; for <em>The
         Critic</em>, see the letter from Whitman to Jeannette L. and Joseph B.
      Gilder of .<a href="#r2">[back]
