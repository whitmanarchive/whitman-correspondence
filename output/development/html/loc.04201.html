      <br></br><br></br>My dear Master
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your card of July 20 in due course two days ago. It makes me feel how very
      remiss I have been in not acknowledging the volume of your Complete Works, which I
      am already in the habit of calling to myself "Whitman's Bible," &amp; which remains
      the colossal monument of your arduous life-labours—monumentum aere perennius,
      as Horace says.<sup><a href="#loc.04201_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Reading this great book, I found on P: 291 in "Collect" the passage I quoted from
      the
      essay known to me under its old title of "Poetry of the Future". But it was then too
      late to alter the reference in my own essay on "Democratic Art" w. had been printed
      a considerable time before it was published. I hope to have a second edition of my
      "Essays Speculative &amp; Suggestive" (for only 750 copies were printed); &amp; if I
      do so, I shall remodel the whole drift of that article.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now I must thank you for the generous &amp; to</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>me most highly acceptable, by me most reverently guarded, gift of your
      portraits—a sheaf of portraits unique in their significance &amp; interest.
      Many friends have shared with me the pleasure &amp; profit of studying &amp;
      comparing them. If you have no objection to the idea, I should like to have some of
      the photographs of middle &amp; later life reproduced by a permanent process, which
      has recently been invented by a very able chemist at Munich: Obernetter<sup><a href="#loc.04201_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>. I will send
      you a specimen of his skill, the reproduction of one of Rembrandt's etchings, which
      will bear the closest comparison with the original.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I want next to ask you a question about a very important portion of your teaching,
      which has puzzled a great many of your disciples &amp; admirers. To tell the truth,
      I have always felt unable to deal, as I wish to do, comprehensively with your
      philosophy of life, because I do not even yet understand
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>the whole drift of "Calamus." If you have read Mr. Havelock Ellis' "New Spirit"<sup><a href="#loc.04201_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>, w.
      contains a study of your work in thought &amp; speculation, you may have noticed on
      p: 108 that he expresses some perplexity about the doctrine of "manly love", &amp;
      again p: 121 he uses this phrase "the intimate &amp; physical love of comrades &amp;
      lovers".
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This reference to Havelock Ellis helps me to explain what it is I want to ask you.
      In
      your conception of comradeship, do you contemplate the possible intrusion of those
      semi-sexual emotions &amp; actions which no doubt do occur between men? I do not
      ask, whether you approve of them, or regard them as a necessary part of the
      relation? But I should much like to know whether <u>you are
         prepared to leave them to the inclinations &amp; the conscience of the
         individuals concerned?</u></p>
   
   
   <p>For my own part, after mature deliberation, I hold that the present laws of France
      &amp; Italy are right upon this topic of morality. They place the personal relations
      of adults of both sexes upon the same foundation: that is to say,
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>they protect minors, punish violence, &amp; guard against outrages of public decency.
      Within these limitations, they leave individuals to do what they think fit. But, as
      you know, these principles are in open contradiction with the principles of English
      (and I believe American) legislation.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It has not infrequently occurred to me among my English friends to hear your
      "Calamus" objected to, as praising &amp; propagating a passionate affection between
      men, which (in the language of the objectors) has "a very dangerous side", &amp;
      might "bring people into criminality".
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now: it is of the utmost importance to me as your disciple, &amp; as one who wants
      sooner or later to diffuse a further knowledge of your life-philosophy by criticism;
      it is most important to me to know what you really think about all this.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I agree with the objectors I have mentioned that, human nature being what it is,
      &amp; some men having a strong natural bias toward
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>persons of their own sex, the enthusiasm of "Calamus" is calculated to encourage
      ardent &amp; <u>physical</u> intimacies.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But I do not agree with them in thinking that such a result would be absolutely
      prejudicial to social interests, which I am certain that you are right in expecting
      a new Chivalry (if I may so speak) from one of the main &amp; hitherto imperfectly
      developed factors of the human emotional nature. This, I take it, is the spiritual
      [
      <span class="unclear">atome?</span>]
       of your
      doctrine in Calamus.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And, as I have said, I prefer the line adopted by French &amp; italian legislature to
      that of the English penal code.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Finally, what I earnestly desire to know is whether you are content to leave the
      ethical problems regarding the private behaviour of comrades toward each other, to
      the person' own sense of what is right &amp; fit—or whether, on the other
      hand, you have never contemplated while uttering the Gospel of Comradeship, the
      possibility of any such delicate difficulties occurring.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Will you enlighten me on this? If I am not allowed to hear from yourself or from some
      one who will communicate your views, I fear I shall never be
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>able to utter what I want to tell the world about your teaching, with the confidence
      &amp;
      thorough sense of not misinterpreting you in one way or the other which are
      inseparable from truly sympathetic &amp; powerful exposition.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The precise drift of "Whoever you are"—what the one indispensible thing
      is—I cannot get at; &amp; I am not sure what the drift of "Earth my likeness"
      is.—Ah, if I could only once have spoken to you, you would certainly have let
      me know.—Lieber Mann, geehrter Meister, das fehlt mir doch!<sup><a href="#loc.04201_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is perhaps strange that a man within 2 months of completing his 50th year should
      care at all about this ethical bearing of Calamus. Of course I do not care much
      about it, except that ignorance on the subject presents me from forming a complete
      view of your life-philosophy.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
