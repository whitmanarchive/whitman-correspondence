   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00571_n1">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      wrote this letter on a blank verso of George Washington Whitman's  letter to Louisa, which Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman enclosed with his  letter to Walt Whitman.<br><br>
      Edwin Haviland Miller assigned the letter the approximate date October 21?,
      1863 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 1:374). Because Walt acknowledged
      receiving "Yours &amp; George's letter" in his  reply to Louisa, and October 27 was a Tuesday in
      1863, this letter from Louisa, which was written on the Wednesday preceding
      Walt's October 27 letter, must date to October 21, 1863.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00571_n2">2. See George Washington
      Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the sixth child
      of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt
      Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 and remained on
      active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle
      of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of
      Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and
      began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and later a
      mason named French. George eventually took up a position as inspector of pipes
      in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00571_n11">3. Walt Whitman reported
      sending a letter to George Washington Whitman in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. He reported
      sending two more letters to George in his  letter to Louisa, one on October 14 and a "short note" that he
      had forwarded with Louisa's October 19 letter (not extant). George began his
       letter (which Louisa
      forwarded to Walt) with the complaint that he had been expecting "for the last
      two weeks to get a letter from home." Louisa also paraphrased George's surmise
      toward the end of his October 16 letter that the geographical separation of the
      Fifty-first Regiment, New York Volunteers, in Camp Nelson, Kentucky, had
      resulted in letters addressed to the 9th Army Corps being sent to Knoxville,
      Tennessee (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> [Durham:
      Duke University Press, 1975], 107–109). Thomas Jefferson Whitman enclosed
      George's October 16 letter, Louisa's note to Walt on George's letter (this
      letter), and the letter that Louisa "sat right down and wrote to [George],"
      which is not extant, with his 
      letter to Walt (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth Price, ed., <em>Dear
         Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent
      State University Press, 1984], 80–82).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00571_n6">4. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      son Andrew Jackson Whitman (1827–1863) was married to Nancy McClure
      Whitman. During Andrew's lifetime, he and Nancy had two sons James "Jimmy" and
      George "Georgy," and Nancy was pregnant when Andrew died in December 1863 of the
      throat condition from which he was suffering at this time. In the early 1860s,
      Andrew worked as a carpenter, and he enlisted briefly in the Union Army during
      the Civil War (see Martin G. Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 10 [Winter 1993],
      142–148).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n11">5. Jesse Whitman
      (1818–1870) was the first-born son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr. He suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence
      for several years before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in
      December 1864. Shortly after an outburst that followed his brother Andrew
      Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened Martha Mitchell and
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in
      some hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see Jeff's  to Walt Whitman). Louisa resisted
      institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her  letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put
      him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic
      Asylum on Flatbush Avenue, where he remained until his death on March 21, 1870
      (see E. Warner's  letter to Walt).

   <p id="duk.00465_n9">6. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00423_n4">7. Nancy McClure Whitman was
      the wife of Walt Whitman's brother, Andrew Jackson Whitman. James "Jimmy" and
      George "Georgy" were Nancy and Andrew's sons, and Nancy was pregnant with
      Andrew, Jr., when her husband died in December 1863. Andrew, Jr., died in 1868,
      and Georgy died in 1872. For Nancy and her children, see Jerome M. Loving, ed.,

   <p id="duk.00467_n1">8. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter.<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n3">9. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
