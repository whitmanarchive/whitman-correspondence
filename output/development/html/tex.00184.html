      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your letter of Wednesday evening last—I thought it would be very
      blustering &amp; cold there on the hill this winter, &amp; I know you must have
      freezing times, especially in the west rooms—We have had a great deal of snow
      here, &amp; very cold weather. I get along very well, considering.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I have to inform you that poor Mrs. Grayson has gone at last.<sup><a href="#tex.00184_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I wrote in my last letter that I had met her son Willy
      in the street, Monday Jan. 7, &amp; he told me she was somewhat better—well,
      it was that very night, she died, &amp; was buried the next Wednesday—they
      sent me word that the funeral was to be at ½ past 2—but the man didn't
      tell me any thing about it till 4—so I was not at the funeral—poor
      woman, she is at rest, &amp; it is a blessed thing for her—she had an easy
      &amp; peaceful death, I hear—But that devil, old Grayson, it is he that was
      the cause of her dying—about three days before her death, he had a fight in
      the house, with his son-in-law—there was great excitement, &amp; Old Grayson
      put them all out of the house, son-in-law, children, &amp;c—I suppose that
      hastened Mrs. Grayson's death—I have not been there, but shall go &amp; see
      poor old Mrs. Mix<sup><a href="#tex.00184_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—She will not last long now—Old Aunt Kitty, the washwoman, says
      that Mrs. Grayson spoke much about me, &amp; wanted me to come &amp; see
      her—but I never knew any thing of it—(Mother, I believe there can be a
      greater nuisance &amp; devil even than Heyde.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, we are having pretty serious times here, in Congress, &amp;c—I rather
      think they are going to impeach Johnson &amp; bring him to trial—it is a
      serious business—I cannot tell how it will turn out—only I know both
      sides seem determined, &amp; neither will give an inch<sup><a href="#tex.00184_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There have been several died in the hospital, that I was with a good deal, since I
      last wrote—one of consumption—one of abscess on the liver, very
      bad—I was down there Sunday afternoon, carried a great big 12 pound cake, for
      the men's supper—there was a piece for all, &amp; very acceptable—as
      the supper consisted of plain bread, a thin wash they called tea, &amp; some
      miserable apple sauce—that was all—I carry a big cake often of Sunday
      afternoons—I have it made for me by an old mulatto woman, cook, that keeps a
      stand in the market—it is sort of molasses pound cake, common but good.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received a letter from old Uncle Otis Parker, the old man that I got pardoned
      down at Cape Cod, Mass. He
      is very grateful.<sup><a href="#tex.00184_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Every thing in the office here goes on as usual. I have a little more work to do than
      I have had. One of the clerks, the youngest, was dismissed, (or suspended,) lately
      for selling some information about pardons to the <em>Herald</em>—the Attorney Gen'l was very mad about it, &amp; gave him a sharp
      talking to. We are having quite good sleighing here to-day.
      
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well good bye, dear mother—&amp; give my love to George, &amp; Jeff, &amp;
      Matty, &amp; all.<sup><a href="#tex.00184_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>

      was indicted on seven counts of theft. On , Whitman wrote a letter to Attorney General Henry Stanbery
      successfully petitioning for a pardon on the grounds that "the whole theory on

      had "already served four years in prison."<a href="#r4">[back]
