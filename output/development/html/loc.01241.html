      <br></br><br></br>Dear Old Walt— 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was right glad to get your card and find you hadn't forgotten me; and that you
      still keep going along, fairly cheerful. You must feel rather lonely at times. I
      have been wondering all night whether there is any sense in the world at
      all—and I don't know what to make of it! I have had a baddish time the last few
      days and feel tired out &amp; sick. A very dear friend of mine — we have been companions
      day &amp; night for many months now — has taken to girl whom I can't say I 
      much care for. She is right enough — &amp; they both have behaved awfully
      well to me; but just now I feel as if I had lost him and am rather dumpy
      — tho' I don't know that it will be
      altogether bad in the end.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am occupying a large attic here in a crowded &amp; smoky part of Sheffield, &amp;
      below am running a coffee tavern in conjunction with one or two Socialist friends.
      We (our Soct Society) have also a large room on the premises, and we have meetings
      pretty often, sociable evenings, lectures singing &amp;c. My friend of whom I spoke
      is in the cutlery trade, a razor grinder—very warmhearted free &amp; natural. Most
      of our fellows are very friendly &amp; sociable in their ways, &amp; we have good times. I
      still keep the place going at Millthorpe,<sup><a href="#n4124" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; spend part of my time
      there—and it is good to get out into the country from here. The
      Fearnehoughs<sup><a href="#n3063" id="r2">2</a></sup> are still at Millthorpe, but Annie the girl
      has left and come into Sheffield to learn dress-making. Glad to hear from you
      any time, Walt. Write now &amp; then if you can. I suppose you will see Herbert
      Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r3">3</a></sup> before long. With love to you as ever—
      &amp; we do not forget you over here.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).
