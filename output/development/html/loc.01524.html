      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear son, I received your second letter to–day, also the Star. I sent you a letter
      Tuesday evening, which I suppose you have received. As I am now sitting in my room
      &amp;
      have no desire to go to bed yet, I will commence another. Give my best respects to
      George
      Smith<sup><a href="#loc.01524_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—also to Pensey Bell &amp; his brother George<sup><a href="#loc.01524_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—also to Mr. Shedd<sup><a href="#loc.01524_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—and in
      fact to all my railroad friends, whenever they inquire after me—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear son, I can almost see you drowsing &amp; nodding since last Sunday, going home
      late—especially as we wait there at 7th st. and I am telling you something deep about
      the heavenly bodies—&amp; in the midst of it I look around &amp; find you fast asleep,
      &amp; your head on my shoulder like a chunk of wood—an awful compliment to my
      lecturing powers. All the talk here now is either the war on the Rhine,<sup><a href="#loc.01524_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> or the murder of old Mr. Nathan,<sup><a href="#loc.01524_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> or
      some other murder—for there are plenty of them—I send you a couple of papers
      with pieces about them. Say whether they come safe. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I believe that is all for to–night, as it is getting late—Good night,
      Pete—Good night, my darling son—here is a kiss for you, dear boy—on the
      paper here—a good long one—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thursday—4th—I have been out all the forenoon &amp; until about 2
      o'clock—had some business in New York, which I attended, then came back &amp; spent an
      hour &amp; a half on the river, with one of the pilots, a particular friend of
      mine—saw the yachts, several of them, including the America out practising, for the
      great race that comes off Monday<sup><a href="#loc.01524_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—the Dauntless was out
      yesterday—&amp; the Cambria went down three days ago—the America is the
      handsomest little craft I ever laid eyes on—I also saw Henry Ward Beecher<sup><a href="#loc.01524_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> &amp; had some talk with him—I find myself going with the
      pilots muchly—there are several that were little boys, now grown up, &amp; remember me
      well—fine hearty fellows—always around the water—sons of old
      pilots—they make much of me—&amp; of course I am willing—
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>10 o'clock at night</em>—As this is lying here on my table to be
      sent off tomorrow, I will imagine you with your arm around my neck saying Good night,
      Walt—&amp; me—Good night, Pete—
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>Friday morning Aug 5</em>. All well—fine weather &amp; I feel in
      good spirits—I am just going out, &amp; across to New York. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>We had a heavy shower here yesterday afternoon, 4th—the weather is not too hot
      here.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01524_n1">1. The envelope is addressed "Peter Doyle, |

      It is postmarked "New-York | Aug | 5 | 130 P.M.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01524_n2">2. The 1869 Washington Directory listed
      George S. Smith, a driver. In an entry dated October 13, 1868, in an address
      book (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #108), Walt Whitman referred to Smith as a driver on the Fifth Avenue
      "stage" in New York.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01524_n3">3. The 1869 Directory listed at the same
      address George A. Bell, a conductor, and Horace Bell, a messenger.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01524_n4">4. Henry Shedd, the driver of the streetcar
      (#14) on which Doyle was the conductor.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.01524_n5">5. The New York <em>Times</em>
      of August 3, 1870, reported the "first battle" of the Franco-Prussian War, the
      capture of Saarbruck by the French.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01524_n6">6. According to the New York <em>Times</em>, Benjamin Nathan, a wealthy broker and one of the
      founders of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, was murdered in his home on July
      29, 1870. For days the newspaper carried lengthy accounts of the unsolved
      murder.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01524_n7">7. The Queen's Cup Race was held off Staten
      Island on August 8, 1870. The <em>Dauntless</em> finished second,
      the <em>America</em> fourth, and the <em>Cambria</em> eighth. On August 9, 1870, the New York <em>Times</em> observed: "The contest was probably attended by more public and
      wide-spread enthusiasm than any American sporting event that has ever occurred,
      either on land or water."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01524_n8">8. Henry Ward Beecher (1813–1887),
      Congregational clergyman and brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, accepted the
      pastorate of the Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, in 1847. Walt Whitman described him
      briefly in the Brooklyn <em>Daily Advertiser</em> of May 25, 1850,
      reprinted in <em>The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt
         Whitman</em>, ed. Emory Holloway, 1:234–235; see also <em>I Sit and Look Out</em>, 84–85, and Horace Traubel, ed.,
