   <p>After a great trouble, or death, a sort of <u>silence</u> &amp;
      <u>not</u> trying words or to depict y'r feelings come to me
      strongest—But I will send a word any how to you dear friend, of sympathy &amp;
      how the death of William,<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> for all I have for some time
      anticipated, comes very bitterly—I am somewhat better, &amp; late yesterday
      afternoon I was taken out &amp; jaunted around for an hour—my first experience
      of out door for most a year, &amp; it was very refreshing—then when I came
      back &amp; up to my room I spent the sunset &amp; twilight hour thinking in silence
      of W. and you &amp; old times in Wash'n—Best love to you, &amp; send me word
      when you can—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
