   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3166">1. Thomas Eakins (1844–1919) was
      an American painter. His relationship with Whitman was characterized by deep
      mutual respect, and he soon became a close friend of the poet. For more on
      Eakins, see Philip W. Leon, "Eakins, Thomas (1844–1916)," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00836_n1">2. Whitman is referencing the
      poem "England in 1819" by Percy Bysshe Shelley.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n6113">3. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
