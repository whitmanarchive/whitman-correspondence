   <p>Yours of 5th has reach'd me. Though mainly the same as for a tedious long while, I
      have
      fluctuated (&amp; am fluctuating) through a series of bad spells—brain &amp; other
      organs—these current times. My general strength, however, from fair to middling. Dont
      feel to leave my anchorage here, just now—but hope yet to take advantage of your
      affectionate &amp; hospitable offers.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00421_n1">1. The account of Whitman's ailments makes
      1875 a plausible date. On , Joaquin
      Miller promised a visit shortly. As for the recipient, the reference to the
      engraving indicates Linton. Furthermore, according to Linton's letter of , he was to be in New York on June 5,
      1875, at which time he probably renewed the invitation to visit New Haven that
      he had made in his earlier letter.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0360">2. William James Linton (1812–1897), British-born
      wood engraver, came to the U. S. in 1867 and settled near New Haven, Conn. He
      illustrated the works of Whittier, Longfellow, Bryant, and others, wrote the
      "indispensable" <em>History of Wood-Engraving in America</em>
      (1882), and edited <em>Poetry of America, 1776–1876</em>
      (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Walt Whitman's poems as well as his
      picture. Linton's engraving of Walt Whitman appeared in the 1876 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, in <em>Complete Poems
         &amp; Prose</em> (1888–1889), and in <em>The Complete
         Writings of Walt Whitman</em> (1902), 10 vols., II, 156; it inspired the
      poem "Out from Behind This Mask." See Harold Blodgett, "Whitman and the Linton
      Portrait," <em>Walt Whitman Newsletter</em>, IV (1958),
      90–92. According to his <em>Threescore and Ten Years, 1820
         to 1890—Recollections</em> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Walt
      Whitman in Washington and later visited him in Camden, which Whitman reported in
      his , letter to Peter Doyle: "I
      liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, ... a true poet
      who could not write poetry, much of wilfulness accounting for his neglect of
      form." His obituary in the New York <em>Times</em> of January 8,
      1898, called Linton "the greatest wood engraver of his time, an artist in other
      senses, and a poet of no mean ability."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="yal.00421_n2">3. Nothing further is known about this
      meeting with Miller. On August 19, 1875, Whitman spent an evening with Miller in
      Philadelphia (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
