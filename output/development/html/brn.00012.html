   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Joaquin Miller was the pen name of Cincinnatus Heine
      Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of the Rockies" and
      "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <em>Westminster Review</em>
      described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness which marked Walt Whitman's
      poetry." In an entry in his journal dated August 1, 1871, John Burroughs
      recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's poetry; see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin Co., 1931), 60. Whitman met Miller for the first time later in 1872; he
      wrote of a visit with Miller in a 
      letter to Charles W. Eldridge.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="brn.00012_n1">1. This note, now tipped
      into an edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> held at Brown
      University, was unsent. Whitman had already drafted this note when he heard via
      a letter of  that Miller would be coming
      to Camden in early May. Miller asked Whitman to "lay [the two volumes] to one
      side and I will call and get them next month." See Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 9 vols.,
