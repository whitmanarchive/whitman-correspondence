   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Henry "Harry" Buxton
      Forman (1842–1917) was a British man-of-letters, an editor of and
      authority on the works of Keats and Shelley, and, starting in 1887, a
      conspirator in literary forgeries that were exposed after his death. The
      correspondence at this time between Bucke and Forman makes it clear that Bucke
      was also building up Forman's collection of Whitman (D. B. Weldon Library,
      University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario).
