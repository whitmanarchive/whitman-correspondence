   </p>
   
   
   <p>I arrived here safely Saturday evening 6th. Have had
      quite a good time so far. Came direct to the asylum. Went on duty as turnkey Monday
      morning but will not remain here over six weeks or two months as the occupation is
      not pleasant. Cannot sleep at night there are so many unearthly noises and besides
      I
      want to get a position where I can make better wages. And as you know I am of a
      nervous temperament and the least scene shocks me.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I want to go to Detroit 
      Mic, after I leave here; from there to Chicago, and want you to give me a
      letter to any business man you know there. Your recommendation has been the means
      of
      making me some good friends and I am shure with your letter, I can get something good
      in either of the cities. If you are not personally acquainted there give me letter
      to some
      of the newspaper men. It will carry lots of weight. You know how I have started. I
      want to make a lot somewhere. If I could only get in a telegraph office I would be
      one of the happiest fellows you ever saw.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Don't have any privilege here, not even time to write. I am up in my little room
      writing this while my patients are [
      <span class="unclear">sadly?</span>]
       pacing up and down the hall. Have 42 men in my charge. Will
      
      
      
      have to close for the present so good-bye. Please don't forget that
      your boy is away among strangers and a good long letter from his dear friend will
      do
      him good.
   </p>

      Ever your
      <br></br>Harry
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>P.S. Don't forget to write soon and send the letters</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
