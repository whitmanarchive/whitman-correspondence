   <p>I have today your letter of 14th enclosing p. 110 with portrait of E.H.<sup><a href="#n0301" id="r2">2</a></sup> I have the book<sup><a href="#n6136" id="r3">3</a></sup> complete now from p. 5 to p 140 both inclusive.
      Your idea seems to be to sell Nov. Boughs at a reasonable price, and for a <u>special</u> vol. get up the Complete works<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r4">4</a></sup> all in one cover. I
      like this notion, think it is the best plan altogether and hope you will carry it
      out. The big vol. should contain several portraits of yourself and perhaps other
      illustrations (why not use the phototypes of your father &amp; mother that Gutekunst
      got up for my
      book?)—Should have (each copy) an actual autograph. I  wish you would use the little
      introductory poem to "As a strong bird" and <u>sign</u>
      it—no lithograph—and number each copy as you sell it. The paper should
      be very good hand made but rather thin so as not to make the vol. too
      bulky—wide margins—uncut edges except the top which should be
      gilt—the cover should be best cloth, green, with a sprig of grass &amp;
      flowers in gold on the back below the title. Book to be sold only by yourself for
      $10.
   </p>
   
   <p>I like the "N.B." (and especially the "Sands" &amp; "E.H.") more and more (,the
      "Backward Glance" and "Last of War Cases" about as valuable) I think the little vol.
      a most admirable contribution.<sup><a href="#duk.00536_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Pardee<sup><a href="#n4274" id="r6">6</a></sup> is back from the
      Sea<sup><a href="#duk.00536_n2" id="r7">7</a></sup> side, very little better I fear. I expect to go to Sarnia tomorrow to spend
      Sunday with him.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="duk.00536_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: LONDON | PM | AU 17 | 88 | CANADA; CAMDEN, N.J. | AUG | 19 | 1PM |

   <p id="n0301">2. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker from Long
      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his
      influence on Whitman, see David S. Reynolds, <em>Walt Whitman's
         America</em> (New York: Knopf, 1995), 37–39.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6136">3. Bucke is referring to Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em>, which would be published in October
      1888. Whitman was having friends help him read proofs for this book. For more on
      its publication and reception, see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">
         <em>November Boughs</em> [1888]</a>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">4. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00536_n3">5. The short titles Bucke lists
      here are all parts of <em> November Boughs</em>— a
      collection of poems called "Sands at Seventy" and essays titled "Elias Hicks,
      Notes (such as they are)," "A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads," and "Last of
      the War Cases."<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n4274">6. Timothy Blair Pardee
      (1830–1889) was a Canadian lawyer and politician, member of the
      Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontaria, Canada, and Minister of the
      Crown. Pardee appointed Richard Maurice Bucke, with whom he was a close friend,
      as the Superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane in Hamilton at its founding
      in 1876, and then the next year as Superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane
      in London. For more on Pardee, see H. V. Nelles, "Pardee, Timothy Blair," <em>Dictionary of Canadian Biography</em> Vol. 11 (Toronto:
