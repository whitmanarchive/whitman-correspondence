   <p>I send you my letter a day ahead this week<sup><a href="#loc.01647_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Nothing new with me—rec'd the letter of last Sunday—also the <u>Capital</u>, and the <u>Herald</u>—I had a day or two's visit[—]very acceptable[—]from John Burroughs 
      last Saturday &amp; Sunday—he has built a house on the Hudson river about 80 miles from
      N.Y.—has a little farm there, 9 or 10 acres, very nice—As I write I am feeling comfortable,
      
      (but every day &amp; every night seems to bring its bad spell, or several of them.)—Somehow
      
      I still feel that I shall come round, &amp; that we shall be together &amp; have some good
      times again—but I don't know.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
