      <br></br>Camp near Annapolis Md &nbsp; 
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Apl. 16th [1864]
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother Walt.<sup xmlns=""><a href="#duk.00352_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Well here we are nicely fixed in our new Camp at last.</p>
   
   <p>A few days after I last wrote you (we were then in barracks) we pitched camp in a
      wet marshy place,—and just about the time we got our tents up it commenced to rain,
      and kept it up steady for two days. The boys had the devils own time to keep from
      getting swamped, &nbsp;I just fixed my bunk so there was no danger of my getting drowned,
      and then turned in and slept till it stopped raining. As soon as it cleared up we
      pulled up stakes and came here, where we have a nice dry camp and everything comfortable.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are about 2½ miles from the town and about ½ a mile above Camp Parole. Well Walt
      we had rather a tedious journey way down there in Tenn (two weeks steady car riding
      aint much fun I tell you) but then we saw considerable of that part of the Country &nbsp;We
      left New York Feb 25 &nbsp;went to Albany, from there to Buffalo, from there to Indianapolis,
      from there to Jeffersonville and crossed the River to Louisville, stayed here a couple of days waiting for Transportation, and then went
      to Nashville &nbsp;from there to Chattanooga, &nbsp;had the pleasure of seeing Genl Thomas,
      and the celabrated Lookout Mt.<sup><a href="#duk.00352_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and then went on to Knoxville, where we stopped two or three days, drawing ammunition,
      shelter tents for men and Officers and Camp &amp; Garrison equipage, &nbsp;here we were ordered
      to leave all surplus baggage and we started off on the march for a place called Mossy
      Creek about 40 miles from Knoxville where it was said there was a small force of Rebs.
      After a march of two days we reached the Creek and found everything quiet and after
      staying there one night we were ordered to bout face and march back to Knoxville,
      where we took the cars again and came back over the same route.
   </p>
   
   <p>East Tenn no doubt was a very nice place before the war, but now its about the last
      place that I want to go to. The most of the large farmers and rich men seems to have
      gone off with the rebs, and the poor folks have about all they can do, to get bacon
      and corn meal enough to keep them alive. Knoxville looks as if it might have been
      quite a nice place, once upon a time, but there is not the least signs of business
      neither there or at Chattanooga except it is, business connected with Military affairs. It must
      have been pretty hard times in Knoxville during the siege,<sup><a href="#duk.00352_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> as our Brigade say, that for some days, all the Commissary Stores issued, was three
      ears of corn to each man for his days rations.
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt, I have expected you on here almost every day. I got your letter of Apl 9th.
      I wrote Mother yesterday, and shall write to her often. Mother I fear is not very
      well this Spring, &nbsp;I do wish she would not wory and work the way she does, &nbsp;One thing is certain she cant always expect to work and
      slave as she always has done, and I think the sooner she slacks up the better it will
      be for her.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am first rate, &nbsp;we have had about 65 or 70 Recruits and we hear there are some 150
      or 200 more in New York for us. General Grant and Burnside<sup><a href="#duk.00352_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> paid us a visit a few days ago, &nbsp;we had no review or any thing of that kind but the
      Regt just fell in line and Grant rode along and looked at them and then went on about
      his business. &nbsp;We are getting quite a large force here and there is considerable speculation
      as to where we are going, but the general impression is that we will go back to North
      Carolina and through into Virginia. While Lee moves up from the front towards Richmond,
      but it seems to me time that something was underway if we are going to do much this
      Spring. I dont see any signs of our leaving here for some time yet. We are haveing lots of drills, and have been kept pretty buisy since we have been here.
   </p>
   
   <p>Col LeGendre,<sup><a href="#duk.00352_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; Capt Sims<sup><a href="#duk.00352_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> are on to New York yet recruiting, (Sims has been there since last Sept) &nbsp;Pooley<sup><a href="#duk.00352_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> is here and just as good natured as ever, &nbsp;McReady<sup><a href="#duk.00352_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> is 2d Lieut of my Co but is now in command of Co F &nbsp;Frank Butler<sup><a href="#duk.00352_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> is fat as ever.

      off and go to bed.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
