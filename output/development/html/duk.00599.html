   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00599_n13">1. This letter dates to July
      20, 1870. The date July 20 is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard
      Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1870. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's
      date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 2:368). The year 1870 is consistent with
      the injury to and infection of Walt Whitman's thumb, and Louisa's remarks on
      political concerns about the widening of the Franco-Prussian War and on a
      Brooklyn heat wave also are consistent with the year.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00599_n7">2. Walt Whitman's July 18?,
      1870 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:362).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00599_n6">3. St. Louis was the home of
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman
      (1833–1890) and family. The most recent letter from either Jeff or his
      wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) was Mattie's March 30,
      1870 letter to Louisa (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1977], 70–71). Jeff had departed Brooklyn in 1867 to assume the
      position of the Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis, and Mattie and their
      daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa, joined him in 1868. For more on Jeff,
      see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>." For more on Mattie, see
      Waldron, 1–26.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00467_n1">4. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00599_n3">5. Robert F. Westcott founded
      the Manhattan Express Company, a packet and mail service, in 1851 (see Alexander
      Stimson, <em>Express Office Handbook and Directory</em> [Bedford,
      Massachusetts: Applewood, 1860], 115–116). The offices and delivery
      service were known by the name Westcott's Express.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00599_n5">6. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      had mentioned preparing a box for daughter Hannah (Whitman) Heyde earlier in the
      month, and she intended to enclose a recent photograph (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman). For Louisa's
      preparation of gift boxes, which Sherry Ceniza has designated "care packages"
      and compared to Walt's poetry, see <em>Walt Whitman and
         19th-Century Women Reformers</em> (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press,
      1998), 10–12.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00599_n15">7. Walt Whitman returned to
      Brooklyn from late July through October 1870 to see into press <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1871–1872), <em>Passage to
         India</em> (1871), and <em>Democratic Vistas</em>
      (1871).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00599_n1">8. Summaries of London press
      reports speculated about the possible widening of the Franco-Prussian War should
      Russia or Spain intervene. If England joined the conflict, France threatened to
      provide material support to the Fenians (see below), an Irish independence
      organization ("The War Widening," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>,
      July 19, 1870, 4).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00599_n4">9. The Fenians or the Fenian
      Brotherhood was founded in New York in 1858 by John O'Mahoney. The open American
      association was affiliated with the Brotherhood (later the Irish Republican
      Brotherhood) founded in Dublin by James Stephens. Both organizations were
      dedicated to the cause of an independent Irish Republic (see <em>Ireland and the Americas</em>, ed. James P. Byrne, Philip Coleman, and
      Jason King [Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2008], xxxii). Because Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman paired the term "fenians" with "roughfs," she probably used the
      designation "Fenians" in a more general sense to refer to working-class Irish
      immigrants in New York.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00599_n16">10. The very clipped form,
      which is most likely "gd," is presumably the word "good" that is contracted at
      the edge of the page.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00599_n8">11. For the scarcity of ice and
      the rising death toll from heat in the New York and Brooklyn area, see "An
      Epidemic of Heat," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, July 20, 1870,
      3.<a href="#r11">[back]

      inverted in the top margin of the first page.<br><br>
      Walt Whitman cut his thumb in late April or early May 1870, and it became
      infected. He referred to the injury in two letters from Brooklyn, a  letter to Walbridge A. Field and a
      second  letter to William D.
      O'Connor. Louisa inquired about or expressed concern for his thumb in this
      and five other letters to Walt from May or June to July 1870: , , , , and .<a href="#r12">[back]
