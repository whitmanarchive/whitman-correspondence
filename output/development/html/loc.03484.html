      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr Whitman—
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I want to thank you for the beautiful photograph of yourself sent me through Miss
      Smith.<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> It is too true a likeness of you as you are
      now to represent the author of the Leaves of Grass. The picture which hung on 
      yr
      
       wall showed that person better—his paganism, his full senses, his
      readiness to identify himself with all things, his insubordination, &amp; his
      recklessness of the fine relations 
       which change a
      world of things into a world of persons. If I could prefer a poet to a man, I should
      like that picture better. But this will be the best reminder of the beautiful
      [

       spirit who met me in Camden &amp; said, "I did the work sincerely. So it is
      honorable. God shall use it to help men, or else let him throw it away." 
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With warm regard, I am
      <br></br>Sincerely yours,
      <br></br>G.H. Palmer

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Herbert Palmer
      (1842–1933) was a Bostonian scholar and writer who would become the
      professor of natural religion and moral philosophy at Harvard in 1889. Mary
      Whitall Smith took classes with him (as his only female student) and considered
      Palmer "a very fine teacher" (Tiffany L. Johnston, "Mary Whitall Smith at the
      Harvard Annex," <em>Berenson &amp; Harvard: Bernard and Mary as
         Students</em> exhibition, The Harvard University Center for Italian
      Renaissance Studies).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02189_n1">1. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
