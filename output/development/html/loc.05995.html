   </p>
   
   <p>As you see by my address I am staying with a great friend of yours. You may see him
      this summer for he is going to America at the end of April,—going out as a
      schoolmaster to settle somewhere up the Hudson. He is an uncommonly good fellow, quiet
      earnest serious soul and very practical, full of solid worth,
      whose knowledge and attainments are sure to be valued in America. His father is a
      clergyman,  and
      this son of his reads Leaves of Grass silently unobserved by the rest of his orthodox
      family.
   </p>
   
   <p>I posted a copy of my book to you about a week ago: I hope that you will read it and
      tell me how you like it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Andrew Lang<sup><a href="#n3116" id="r8">8</a></sup> wrote a leader in the Daily News about it and fine
      things have been said in the London, and <u>Scotch Press</u>
      particularly. As yet, I have not taken
      my passage, but I hope to come early in May, and to spend a nice slice of my time
      near you in Camden. I consider that your poems have gained ground here perceptibly
      within the last 2 years. Leonard Brown sends his love &amp;

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0262">1. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05995_n1">2. Whitman noted the receipt of
      Herbert's book, <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>, on
      April 5 (Whitman's Commonplace Book [Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.]).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0259">3. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n4310">4. Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford (b.
      1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked by
      early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="upa.00088_n3">7. Leonard M. Brown, a young
      English schoolteacher and friend of Herbert Gilchrist, came to America in May,
      1887. On  Gilchrist wrote to
      Whitman: "he is an uncommonly good fellow, quiet earnet serious soul and very
      practical, full of solid worth, whose knowledge and attainments are sure to be
      valued in America. His father is a clergyman, and this son of his reads Leaves
      of Grass silently &amp; unobserved by the sect of his orthodox family." An entry
      in Whitman's Commonplace Book on August 29 reads: "Leonard Morgan Brown goes
      back to Croton-on-Hudson—has been here ab't a week" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). See also Whitman's letter to Leonard Brown of ; his letter to Herbert Gilchrist
