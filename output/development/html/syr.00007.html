      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>1) the address of K. Elster is</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Kristian Elster</p>
   
   <p>Strandgade 38</p>
   
   <p>[
      <span class="unclear">Throndhjem?</span>]
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Norway</p>
   
   <p>2) I wrote in the midst of March a long letter to you in a large yellow envelope;—have
      you received it?
   </p>
   
   <p>3) I should be glad, if John Burroughs would send me his photography; tell him that
      I like his book very much.
   </p>
   
   <p>I received in March or April with an interval of eight days both the pages of Columbus
      and The redwood Tree in Harper's Magazine. Of the redwood Tree I have had the greatest.
      It is your old great theme in a simple and powerful tale, embracing the holy and [
      <span class="unclear">original?</span>]
       nation of the far West.
   </p> 
   
   <p>5) I am very glad to be furnished with new materials concerning the American humor.
      In these waggish gasconades like the [
      <span class="unclear">embryon?</span>]
      
      
      
      
      of a comical poet greater than any of the old world's in present and past. But you your humourists of the day I don't like. Mark Twain has been translated into Danish this
      year. He is a detestable fool.
   </p>
   
   <p>6)[
      <span class="unclear">Clemen Petersen's?</span>]
       letter has amused me very much. His force is the psychological critic, the analyzing
      power, which he can't use in America, where the words have too much to do to follow
      such subtle explorings. Therefore he has had to be poetical traveller; but his fancy
      is important and he has no great [
      <span class="unclear">sum?</span>]
       of observation. In Sweden he never has had his foot. [
      <span class="unclear">Touching?</span>]
       is what he speaks of "a letter from your mother." His mother, which he never shall
      see more, is the only being in the world, which he loves. I should be glad to have
      the [
      <span class="unclear">continuation?</span>]
       of his letters.
   </p>
   
   <p>7) I have sent you all the criticism on your book, [
      <span class="unclear">slang?</span>]
      , chatter and earnest [
      <span class="unclear">critic—all!?</span>]
       the criticism in "[
      <span class="unclear">Dagohelegraphen?</span>]
      " is good, but the best is Elster's. I got the number of "[
      <span class="unclear">Aftenblaket?</span>]
      " here in Kopenhagen and sent it you for security's sake; probably it has also been sent you from Norway.
      It should interest me to know what impression also the [
      <span class="unclear">varigated?</span>]
      
      
      
      
      opinions have made on you. Paticuly I long to hear, if the criticism of Elster has been completely translated to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>8) Has this translation of your book into Danish not been spoken of in the American
      papers?
   </p>
   
   <p>May the line meet you in good health and joyfull. Do you understand my bad English?</p>
