   <p id="n0793">2. Rudolf Schmidt, a Dane and
      editor of <em>For Idé og Virkelighed</em>, is credited with
      introducing Walt Whitman to Scandinavia by quoting translated passages from <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in a 1872 essay in his magazine. He wrote
      to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871:
      "I intend to write
      an article about yourself and your writings in the above named periodical which
      is very much read in all the Scandinavian countries. ... I therefore take the
      liberty to ask you, if you should not be willing to afford some new
      communications of yourself and your poetry to this purpose" (The Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="rlc.00015_n2">3. On , Schmidt reported his recent marriage to "my dear faithful little
      wife, to whom I have been betrothed since some years." The letter written "six
      weeks before" may be Schmidt's letter of , in which he admitted his failure to sell Walt Whitman's books in
      Denmark. Walt Whitman's reply, probably written late in May or early in June
      1876, is not known.<a href="#r3">[back]
