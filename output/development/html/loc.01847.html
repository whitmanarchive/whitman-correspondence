      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Continued good-will well-supported by <u>a constantly enlarging</u> sense of your great merit as a writer fitted to both please and instruct, leads me
      to write this after quite a spell of silence. [
      <span class="unclear">I?</span>]
       can make it, tho', only a sorry [
      <span class="unclear">sort?</span>]
       of <u>an Appendix</u> to the series of letters I was [
      <span class="unclear">sending you?</span>]
       through the [
      <span class="unclear">first?</span>]
       half and seventh month of [
      <span class="unclear">the year?</span>]
      . The intention or one purpose of these letters being to divert [illegible] you with <u>a phase of life</u> that probably [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">not?</span>]
       fail to be <u>new</u> [
      <span class="unclear">to you?</span>]
      . As I have sometimes [
      <span class="unclear">said?</span>]
       [illegible] many [
      <span class="unclear">years?</span>]
       past, it is doubtful whether any one could imagine a human character [
      <span class="unclear">certainly?</span>]
       but that [
      <span class="unclear">the?</span>]
       wide world could furnish [
      <span class="unclear">one specimen?</span>]
       to fill its requirements—so, on the [
      <span class="unclear">other hand?</span>]
      , it is altogether impossible for one individual [illegible] considerably or markedly different from all [illegible] have come under the observation of any one man. And this is a good answer to those
      <u>fools</u> who say there cannot be so much as <u>one perfectly honest</u> man on earth. I have said I was fully convinced there are men who would not <u>yield their integrity</u> for <u>an endless life</u> and as much <u>gold as half the bulk of the earth</u> with the other half to spend it on at present value—nor would they accept the <u>throne</u> and <u>prerogatives of God</u> on such condition (of being unjust).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In your first letter (more than a year ago) you said you would "much, much" like to
      "look in upon" me—well, you <u>have</u> looked in upon a real, live, "good enough" and also (by [
      <span class="unclear">jingo?</span>]
      !) <u>not too good</u> a man—a sincere, enthusiastic admirerer, and yet in such told and untold particulars
      [
      <span class="unclear">as?</span>]
       we might differ about, a man "sufficient for himself" and whom laws, theories "conventions"
      and even <u>other</u> Philosophers and Poets <u>shall</u> not "[
      <span class="unclear">muster?</span>]
      "—[
      <span class="unclear">And?</span>]
       so I ask you, did I not [
      <span class="unclear">conduct my?</span>]
       part of that correspondence rightly? For, [
      <span class="unclear">naturally one?</span>]
       whose
      
      
      
      acquaintance should be sought by another man would wish to know—what does he want?
      <u>where</u> is he? and <u>what</u> is he? <u>This is enough</u>.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>(My last before this were July 18 and Aug 14</p>
   
   <p>I will relieve you of any fears that I shall (of myself be wanting to write and be
      written to so frequently hereafter—[
      <span class="unclear">whereupon?</span>]
       looking for anything from you it creates a "[
      <span class="unclear">fiendish?</span>]
       expectation" that <u>troubles</u> me on account [
      <span class="unclear">of the?</span>]
       [illegible] way to and from the Post Office 3½ X 2 = 7 [
      <span class="unclear">miles—ordinary?</span>]
       mail matter I generally wait for the [
      <span class="unclear">pleasant?</span>]
       season or some [
      <span class="unclear">insight to?</span>]
       pass to [illegible] you are publishing anything new I would [
      <span class="unclear">like to?</span>]
       have it if you can <u>credit</u> me for it [illegible] send pay.
   </p>
   
   <p>(Your last a card Aug 13)</p>
   
   <p>The autumn [illegible] and November season, [
      <span class="unclear">usually?</span>]
       by far the [
      <span class="unclear">loveliest of?</span>]
       all the seasons here, has been much trespassed upon [
      <span class="unclear">by?</span>]
       spells of cloudy and rainy weather like our [
      <span class="unclear">common <u>winter</u>?</span>]
      weather—beyond any precedent.  The sharp frosts just before and about Oct 15, coming
      before the forest foliage had matured enough to drop spontaneously, our superabundance
      of wildwood was clad two weeks ago with unusual, surpassing splendor and sweetness,
      but now, much of the glory is gone.  Perhaps to the eye of a Poet and <u>true</u> Philosopher <u>the ripe cotton ball is beautiful as the rose</u>—then shouldn't the cotton field be a rose-garden without thorns? ☞ <u>Put me</u> to kneeling, crawling, sitting, squatting among the cotton rows, fingers busy with
      the beautiful and useful, and thoughts flying undisturbedly over all the earth in
      search of congenialities and reminiscences and then I am a <u>[
         <span class="unclear">ever?</span>]
          so happy</u> diminutive Philosopher and [illegible] Poet.  Of all work I have always liked cotton-[
      <span class="unclear">picking?</span>]
       the best.  And now let this bit of <u>gossip</u> be [
      <span class="unclear">respectful?</span>]
       and kind leave taking or a part of [
      <span class="unclear">something?</span>]
       to be continued at long [
      <span class="unclear">interval?</span>]
       as may [
      <span class="unclear">suit you?</span>]
       best.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.
