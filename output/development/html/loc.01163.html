      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>You can hardly imagine what pleasure it gave me to see your bold strong hand again
      on
      a letter, you look as well as ever in that address, &amp; it is such a satisfaction
      to know you are really better. I believe now you will come out of this crisis as
      you have  out of
      so many others &amp; be yourself again. It is too bad that you have to be cooped up
      in that way. If you could only get up strength of body &amp; will to get out!
      What do you eat? I have made the discovery that raw clams are very
      strengthening &amp; that the juice is a tonic, but I need not tell an old Long
      Islander like you the virtue there is in clams. I eat them from the shell without
      any seasoning. Try some. This cool weather I know you enjoy. It sounded so good to hear you
      speak of its raining. It is dry as a bone here, no rain for many weeks, my potato
      crop is cut short 50 per cent, &amp; all my young vines &amp; plants are suffering
      much. Indeed we have had no rain to speak of since the great snow storm in March.
      I
      hope O'C.<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup> is really mending. If he comes to Camden let me know &amp; I will
      come down too &amp; see him. I try to keep absorbed in my farm operations. It is
      much better for me than to mope about nibbling at literature. I want to get  a sniff of salt
      water again this summer or early fall, &amp; I do so hope you will be well enough to
      join me. I know the sight of the sea would give you a lift. We are all well. My
      regards to Horace Traubel.<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r2">2</a></sup> Tell me something about him when you
      write again. I am very anxious to see <u>November Boughs</u><sup><a href="#n3999" id="r3">3</a></sup> I do
      no writing at all. Send me a card when you are in the mood.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n2002">1. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
