   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00173_n9">1. This letter dates to
      February 6?, 1870. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter February 1, 1870, and
      Edwin Haviland Miller did not list the letter in his calendar of letters (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). The letter dates to approximately a
      week later than Bucke proposed. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman was amused by an
      "account of the ball," which was held in New York in honor of a visit by Prince
      Arthur, seventh child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00173_n1">2. At the time of this letter,
      Louisa remained in Brooklyn with her son Edward after the departure of Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman to St. Louis.
      Her son George Washington Whitman continued to live nearby, though he was often
      away to Camden, New Jersey for his duties as an inspector of pipe for the
      Brooklyn Water Works.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00173_n8">3. Prince Arthur
      (1850–1942), third son and seventh child of Queen Victoria and Prince
      Albert, was posted to a rifle brigade in Canada from 1869 to 1870. Prince
      Arthur was named first duke of Connaught and Strathearn, the title by which
      he is now known, in 1874 (Noble Frankland, "Arthur, Prince, first duke of
      Connaught and Strathearn (1850–1942)," <em>Dictionary of
         National Biography</em> [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004]). The
      young prince visited Washington, D.C., and Brooklyn, New York, in late
      January and early February 1870. He attended dinners and balls in his honor
      in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, January 27, in Brooklyn on Friday, January
      28, and again in Brooklyn, on February 4.<br><br>
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's comment was probably in jest as newspaper
      coverage tended to highlight the contrast between society's fawning
      attention to royalty and America's claimed republican virtue ("Prince does
      his duty," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, January 31, 1870,
      2). A report on a Brooklyn Club Ball and Supper, held in the his honor,
      tends toward satire ("Royalty in Brooklyn: Beauty, Wealth, Worth, and Birth
      Colliding," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, February 5, 1870,
      2).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]

      shortened Saturday to "satur" because she had no room remaining on the
      paper.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00173_n10">6. When interlining the "nt"
      for the previously written word "have," Louisa Van Velsor Whitman added an extra
      "e."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00575_n9">7. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
      adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
      he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
      St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Jeff
      Whitman. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta "Hattie"
      (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" (b. 1863). In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to join Jeff after he had assumed the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in 1867. For more on Mattie, see
      the introduction to Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00467_n1">8. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00173_n16">9. Only the first four letters
      of the word "think" are visible in the image. The letter is pasted into a
      manuscript book, and the final letters on the edge closest to the binding in the
      page image are often obscured. Most of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman manuscript
      letters in the bound volume entitled <em>Walt Whitman: A Series of
         Thirteen Letters from His Mother to Her Son</em>, held at the Harry Ransom
      Center, have obscured text on at least one page. Text from this page was
      recorded based on an examination of the physical volume, which allowed more text
      to be recovered.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n11">10. Helen Price was the
      daughter of Abby and Edmund Price. Abby Price and her family, especially her
      daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman and his mother, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman. Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform
      movements. Price's husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and
      the couple had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in
      1852, at 2 years of age). In 1860, the Price family began to save Walt's
      letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman were included in Richard Maurice
      Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1883), and she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters to
      her mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00173_n13">11. The copy of a Walt Whitman
      poem that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman gave to Helen Price, based on the reference
      to a "christmas present" and the date on which the poem appeared, is presumably

         Visitor</em>, December 25, 1869, 4).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00173_n11">12. Helen Price's employer, the
      "lawyer of pattens," was presumably a patent attorney named Stitson or perhaps
      Stutson, but he has not been identified.<a href="#r12">[back]
