   <p>Your kind &amp; welcome letter came to hand.<sup><a href="#loc.01572_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Pardon me for not responding sooner. I esteem your friendly
      appreciation of "Democracy." I have just sent you "Personalism"—which is to be
      followed, in perhaps a couple of months or so, by another article,<sup><a href="#loc.01572_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> addressing itself
      mainly to the question of what kind of Literature we must seek, for our coming
      America, &amp;c. In the three articles (to be gathered probably in book) I put
      forth, to germinate if they may, what I would fain hope might prove little seeds
      &amp; roots. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still living here in Washington—employed in a post in the Attorney
      General's office, very pleasantly, with sufficient leisure, &amp; almost entirely
      without those peculiar belongings, that make the Treasury &amp; Interior Dep't
      &amp;c. clerkships disagreeable. I am, as ever, working on Leaves of
      Grass—hoping to bring it yet into fitter &amp; fuller proportions. I am well
      as usual. My dear mother is living &amp; well; we speak of you. I wish you to give
      my best respects &amp; love to Mr. Emerson—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01572_n1">1. This draft letter is
      endorsed, "To Mr. Alcott | April 26 '68."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01572_n2">2. This letter is a reply to
      Alcott's of , in which he praised
      Walt Whitman's "Democracy," and added: "I talked last evening with Emerson about
      your strong strokes at the thoughtless literature and Godless faith of this
      East." Alcott noted receipt of Walt Whitman's letter on April 28, 1868: "Say
      what men may, this man is a power in thought, and likely to make his mark on
      times and institutions. I shall have to try a head of him presently for my
      American Gallery: Emerson, Thoreau, and Walt" (<em>The Journals of
         Bronson Alcott</em>, ed. Shepard [Boston: Little, Brown, 1938], 391). : "Yet
      think of the progress out of the twilight since your star dawned upon our hazy
      horizon!" Alcott was so fond of the term "personalism" that he adopted
      it.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01572_n3">3. The article in question
      was "Orbic Literature," first solicited by Walt Whitman in his  letter to William Conant Church and
      Francis Pharcellus Church.<a href="#r3">[back]
