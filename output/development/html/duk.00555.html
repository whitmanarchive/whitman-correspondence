   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00555_n8">1. This letter dates to
      November 18, 1868. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter November 18, 1868, and
      Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:366). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote that she received a
      letter from Charles L. Heyde, her daughter Hannah's husband, "yesterday tuesday
      17th." November 18 fell on a Wednesday in the year 1868, and the letter's
      discussion of Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's illness and the expected
      arrival of Mattie's husband Thomas Jefferson Whitman is consistent with that
      year.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00555_n4">2. This letter is unusual
      for its systematic correction. The marks are faintly visible on the digital
      image but are clearly visible on the manuscript in the Trent Collection at
      Duke University. The corrections appear to be in Louisa's hand, but she may
      have been prompted to make these corrections by her visiting granddaughter
      Manahatta. (Manahatta accompanied her mother Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman for her return to Brooklyn for medical treatment.) It appears that
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in her hand corrected her usual lowercase "i" to
      capital "I" and made many marks to separate phrases. That said, while
      lower-case "i" is more common in later letters, capital "I" is not unusual
      in early letters. Also, the style of the slash to separate phrases is not
      systematically different from the mark that is elsewhere transcribed as a
      closing parenthesis—the style of the mark varies widely. In this
      edition, the dashes have been transcribed as an en dash with a space before
      and after, and the slash-style marks are transcribed as the closing
      parenthesis.<br><br>

   <p id="duk.00553_n1">3. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided
      in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a
      French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for
      his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. In late 1868 Hannah suffered
      a thumb infection that led Doctor Samuel W. Thayer to lance her wrist in
      November and to amputate her thumb the following month (see Charles L. Heyde's
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, December 1868, Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G.

   <p id="duk.00422_n2">4. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00465_n9">6. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York

   <p id="duk.00425_n2">7. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="duk.00555_n2">8. Samuel W. Thayer, a
      Professor of Anatomy at the University of Vermont Medical School, performed
      surgeries in Burlington, Vermont during the 1860s. Walt Whitman inquired about
      Hannah's health in his  letter to
      Thayer. For the Whitman family's bitterness toward Charles L. Heyde and the
      stress that Hannah's health crisis introduced between Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and George Washington Whitman, see Horace Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.70.html">Wednesday, January 9, 1889</a>, <em>With Walt Whitman in
