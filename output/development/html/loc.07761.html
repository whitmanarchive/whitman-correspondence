   <p>Still down sick—it holds on day &amp; night—(well have they call'd it <em>the grip</em>)—I am sitting in my chair to write this, but I
      feel more like lying down, &amp; shall presently do so—I am quite sure nothing
      serious or at all alarming—will probably blow over this coming week—No I
      do not know either the origin nor purpose of the McDermot piece<sup><a href="#loc.07761_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> nor do I care a straw—I have sent you Dr Brinton's
      fine monograph ab't Bruno<sup><a href="#loc.07761_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—(if you want one or two
      more I can send them)—We are having quite a clientage among scientists &amp;
      doctors—a while ago it was actors &amp; artists—Could not eat any
      breakfast—drank a cup of near-hot milk—shall try to take a bowl of
      chicken &amp; rice soup at 4—pretty dismal with me—Warren<sup><a href="#loc.00668_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> is very good &amp; kind &amp; so Mrs: D[avis]<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Of course the massages are given up for the
      present—two days ago (f'm weather &amp; other reasons)—I sweat freely,
      &amp; was better offer—but these two current days are cold—

   <p>near 3 P M—have been lying down—up to finish this &amp; send it
      off—weak &amp; miserable &amp; phlegm-suffocated to an extreme—O the

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07761_n3">3. <em>Giordano Bruno: Philosopher and Martyr</em> (1890) consisted of two
      speeches before the Philadelphia Contemporary Club by Daniel G. Brinton
      (1837-1899), a pioneer in the study of anthropology, and by Thomas Davidson. It
      included a prefatory note by Whitman dated 24 February 1890 (see <em>The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman: Prose Works 1892</em>,
      ed. by Floyd Stovall, 2 vols. (1963-1964), 676-677). In his essay Brinton links
      the poet with Bruno in his rejection of the "Christian notion of sin as a
      positive entity" (34). On April 4, Whitman sent copies of the book to Symonds,
      Tennyson, Sarrazin, Rolleston, and W. M. Rossetti (<em>The
         Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839-1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). See also Whitman's
       letter to Bucke. After the poet
      presented him with a copy of <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em>,
      Brinton expressed his thanks effusively on .<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.00668_n4">4. Frederick Warren Fritzinger
      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,
      535).<a href="#r4">[back]
