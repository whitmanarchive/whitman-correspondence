      <br xmlns="" class="opener">June 15/88.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear W—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I sent word to Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r1">1</a></sup> one day that I had an intuition that you were about to enter
      upon a new lease of life. The next day the telegraph announced you were slightly
      improved  from a
      severe attack of "heart failure." Now Horace writes you are quite yourself again.
      I
      take it my spirit-sense of your condition is not likely to fail after all. But the
      hot weather is 
      coming, &amp; we shall get it by July good &amp; hot. I hope I can get into
      comfortable shape by the time it reaches Camden.
   </p>
   
   <p>Am glad Horace is at hand to afford any help  you might need.</p>
   
   <p>I have about concluded not to go to the Cin. Exposition.<sup><a href="#loc.03184_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> There is so much red tape it
      will cost me all of $20 to exhibit a few busts. I am calculating on starting for Chicago
      middle of next week. I'd like to look in 
      on the Chicago Convention<sup><a href="#loc.03184_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—just to see the shape of the heads that are
      prominent.
   </p> 
   
   <p>I notice a marked difference in the political atmosphere here &amp; in Mass. People here
      are more
      <u>rambunkious</u>; they get mad. The republicans are high toned
      &amp; look down on democrats. If you  show any proclivities of
      democratic color they wonder how you can. How can white think well of black? And
      then, the anti-copperhead talk is still rampant here. The dems are sore some over
       the
      slaughter of Gray, &amp; Harrison<sup><a href="#n4269" id="r4">4</a></sup> would catch many sore head votes. If the Republicans have got
      to have a rushing campaign, they'll get it sooner with the freedom of old 
      Tipicanu (?)
      
      <sup><a href="#loc.03184_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> than with the cold blooded Sherman.<sup><a href="#n4270" id="r6">6</a></sup> But  I believe <u>Blain</u><sup><a href="#n4268" id="r7">7</a></sup> would sweep the States.  Every body fairly dances when his name is
      mentioned. Strange. I can't understand it. Somehow I am drawn personally more to
      Cleveland<sup><a href="#n4271" id="r8">8</a></sup> than any
      one of the others. And yet, he's a kind of a <u>pork</u>.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, this is a hot day here. I hope you keep mending, &amp; that you only went back
      a little for a new start.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4267">1. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n4269">4. Benjamin Harrison (1833–1901)
      was the twenty-third U.S. president and grandson of the ninth president, William
      Henry Harrison. Harrison was the Republican nominee who defeated Democratic
      incumbent Grover Cleveland in 1888.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.03184_n3">5. "Tippecanoe" was the
      nickname used by Harrison's grandfather, William Henry Harrison, in the 1840
      presidential campaign. Morse is here applying it to the grandson and current
      presidential candidate.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n4270">6. John Sherman (1823–1900) was
      an American politician and Republican representative and senator from Ohio. He
      is best known as the author of policies that addressed growing economic
      crisises, including the Sherman Antitrust and Silver Purchase Acts of
      1890.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4268">7. James G. Blaine (1830–1893)
      was an American statesman and Republican politician. He served in the House of
      Representatives (1863–1876), Senate (1876–1881), and twice as
      Secretary of State (1881, 1889–1892). Blaine was the Republican
      presidential nominee in 1884, when he was narrowly defeated by Democratic
      nominee Grover Cleveland.<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="n4271">8. Grover Cleveland (1837–1908)
      was the twenty-second and twenty-fourth U.S. president. Cleveland was the leader
      of the "Bourbon Democrats," whose policies opposed high tariffs and subsidies to
      businesses.<a href="#r8">[back]
