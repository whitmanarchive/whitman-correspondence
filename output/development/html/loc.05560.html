   <p> </span><span class="handshift">The number of deaths that occurred in the [
      <span class="unclear">Union?</span>]
       armies during the slavery war is a question which has been
      widely discussed ever since the collapse of the Confederacy. Many efforts were
      made to obtain reliable statistics,
      and each [illegible] the investigations have brought inquires
      closer to [illegible] be the correct figures. The [illegible]" researches was
      undertaken something [illegible]
      [illegible] General Richard C. Drum, who
      entrusted to Mr. J. W. Kirkley the important work. That gentleman had the
      assistance of a number of competent clerks, and a minute and exhaustive
      investigation was made of all official documents that could be found. The
      results have just been published, and [illegible] a valuable addition to war history. 
   </p>
   
   <p> </span><span class="handshift">The period covered by the record is, for the regular troops, from April 15,
      1861, to August 1, 1865; for a portion of the volunteers it is prolonged beyond
      the last-mentioned date until the mustering out of each organization. The last
      white volunteer organization was disbanded November 18, 1867, and the last
      colored regiment December 20, 1867, and the last officer of the volunteer
      general staff was not mustered out until July 1, 1869. The report shows that the
      aggregate of deaths among the Union forces of 359,496, of which 9,584 were commissioned
      officers and
      349,912 were enlisted men. In detail these figures were distributed as
      follows:—Killed or died, of wounds, 110,[illegible]; died of disease, 224,586, drowned and other accidental
      deaths, 4,114; murdered, 524, [illegible]
      after capture, 100; committed suicide, 391; executed, 267; executed by the
      enemy, 64; died form sunstroke, 313; other known causes, 2,034; causes not
      stated, 12,121. The "other known causes" include deaths resulting from quarrels
      not amounting to murder, form being shot by sentries by the provost guard, and
      miscellaneous causes. In these figures it is noticed that the death registers of
      some of the largest prisons at the South in which Union soldiers were confined
      are missing, such as the prisons at Americus, Atlanta, Augusta, Charleston,
      Lynehburg, Macon, Marietta, Mobile, Montgomery, Savannah, Shreveport, and Tyler;
      and only partial reports are given from Calawba, Columbia, Florence, S. C.
      Millen, and Salisbury. It is known that 29,498 Union soldiers died in captivity,
      while in many instances three or four bodies of Union prisoners were interred in
      the [illegible] grave or trench.

   <p> </span><span class="handshift">The New England [illegible] are
      represented by 40,080 recorded [illegible]; New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, 85,531; the Western States by
      142,489; Missouri, Delaware, Tennessee, and West Virginia, 39,607; from the
      Pacific States and Territories, including California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington
      Territory, Dakotah, New Mexico, and Colorado, 7,297; and 3,854 from States
      included in the Confederacy. It is also observed that 36,847 deaths occurred
      among the colored troops, 5,798 in the regular army,[illegible] among the Indian tribes, and 3,[illegible] among miscellaneous organizations.

      whole —nd fewer than 6,365 of whom were killed in action or died of
      wounds—the report contains many important and interesting details. The
      State of Illinois lost 34,834 men, of whom 1,948 died in Rebel prison pens;
      Indiana, 4,753; Minnesota, 2,584; Nebraska, 239; Ohio, 35,475; Wisconsin,
      12,301.

   <p> </span><span class="handshift">Taking the three most important causes, we find that 4,142 officers and 62,896
      men were killed in action; 2,223 officers and 40,777 men died of wounds and
      2,795 officers and 221,791 men died of disease. Among the enlisted men 30 per
      cent. of the total deaths were of those killed by the enemy, and 66⅔ per
      cent. of the officers form the same cause. Among the men 63 per cent of the
      deaths were occasioned by disease.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0199">2. Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>).
