   <p>I cheerfully consent to Professor's using the words of <em>Two
         Veterans</em> for musical publication—&amp; also give permission for
      further musical adaptation of my pieces—Am curious to see how they go—Am sure I 
      sh'd
      
       be 
      impress'd
      
       and pleased—My western trip has worked well—My health is about
      the same as of late years—
   </p>
   
   <p>When the music is printed—(if printed—) please send me a copy—</p>
