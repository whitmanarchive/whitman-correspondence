      saying that I may announce his name as publisher, &amp; that he will receive subscriptions,<sup><a href="#loc.07694_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; announce that work in his lists.<sup><a href="#loc.07694_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>This afternoon I came home early &amp; wrote off a rough draft of a circular for above
      purpose.
   </p>
   
   <p>When Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> comes he &amp; I will talk it over.
   </p>
   
   <p>Wd you be willing (I hardly dare to ask it) to send me for two yr book of addresses
      
       
      (sent by Express at my cost)— so I 
      cd send out the circulars? Or shd I have to come on &amp; copy them out of it in yr study?
   </p>
   
   <p>I read to-day yr beautiful little poem in <u>The Century</u>.<sup><a href="#loc.07629_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> (I keep up my bibliogr. record always (on the "Whitman")]
   </p>
   
   <p>I made a trip to the art museum recently to see Gen. C. G. Loring,<sup><a href="#loc.07629_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup> the Director, about the bust. Will report later. Baxter<sup><a href="#n6000" id="r7">7</a></sup> has

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03316_n2">1. Frederick W. Wilson was a
      member of the Glasgow firm of Wilson &amp; McCormick that published the 1883
      British edition of <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07694_n1">2. More than a year later, in
      his letter to Whitman of , Kennedy
      wrote that Wilson would publish his book on Whitman only if Kennedy paid the
      costs of production.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07694_n2">3. Kennedy's manuscript
      eventually became two books, <em>Reminiscences of Walt
         Whitman</em> (1896) and <em>The Fight of a Book for the
         World</em> (1926). Alexander Gardner (1821–1882) of Paisley, Scotland,
      a publisher who reissued a number of books by and about Whitman, ultimately
      published <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> in 1896 after a
      long and contentious battle with Kennedy over editing the book.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03310_n1">4. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07629_n4">5. Kennedy is likely referring
      to Whitman's poem "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00136.html">Twilight</a>," which had been published in the December 1887 issue of <em>Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine</em>.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07629_n5">6. Charles G. (C. G.) Loring
      (?–1902) was a Civil War veteran and the director of the Boston Museum of
      Fine Art.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6000">7. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4147">8. Walter Scott was a railway
      contractor and a publisher in London. His publishing firm, Walter Scott, was
      based in London and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and it was the imprint under which
      Whitman's books appeared in England. Walter Scott's managing editor was
      bookbinder David Gordon, and Ernest Rhys—one of Whitman's major promoters
      in England—worked with the firm. Rhys included a volume of Whitman's poems
      in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's prose in the Camelot
      series for Walter Scott publishers. Walter Scott also published Whitman's 1886
      English edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and the English
      editions of <em>Specimen Days in America</em> (1887) and <em>Democratic Vistas, and Other Papers</em> (1888).<a href="#r8">[back]
