   <p> The notion one is going to write a nice long letter is fatal to writing at all. And
      so I mean to scribble something, somehow, a little oftener
      &amp; make up in quantity for quality! For after all the great thing, the thing one
      wants, is to <em>meet</em>—if not in the flesh—then in the spirit. A word will do
      it. I am getting on—my heart is in my work—&amp; though I have been long
      about it, it won't be long—but I think &amp; hope it will be strong. Quite a
      sprinkling of American friends—some new ones this spring—among them Mr.
      &amp; Mrs. Pennell<sup><a href="#loc.05768_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> from Philadelphia—whom you
      know—we like them well—hope to see them again &amp; again. Also Miss
      Keyse (her sister married Emerson's son) from Concord, and the Lesleys—Mary
      Lesley has married &amp; gone to the West—St. Paul—has just got a little
      son.<sup><a href="#loc.05768_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p> How does the "little shanty" answer, I wonder? Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r3">3</a></sup> has been
      painting some charming little bits in an old terraced garden here. I do wish you
      could hear Giddy<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r4">4</a></sup> sing now; I am sure her voice would "go to the
      right spot," as you used to say. Good-bye, dearest friend. Love from all &amp; most
      from

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
