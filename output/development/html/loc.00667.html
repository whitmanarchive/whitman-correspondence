   <p>Do you know Walt dear your letter has done me a world of good. I was out by the gate

   <p>— The country is very beautiful now. trees leaved out some blossoms. Spring is two weeks earlier here than usual no 
      Lilacks even budded here yet.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am trying to clean house, Walt dear, I do it all myself, but I take my time I have
      to. — my carpets are all taken up down 
      stairs (done cleaning up stairs glad to be able to work even my way) 
      Ime slow enough, but do pretty well glad to stop a little while to write a line to you —
   </p>
   
   <p>Cant think of anything Walt dear. but your being better. 
      and being able to be out. I want you to see lots of comfort my dearest brother. you 
      must not worry about anything — your letter is such a comfort to me I shall be able

      to me, always.

   <p>I take comfort too Walt dear, in your having such good friends. Hope you will be out
      to day —

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00667_n1">1. Richard Maurice Bucke dated
      this letter 1889, which is consonant with Hannah's reference to Walt's wheel
      chair, and to her comment about the death of William D. O'Connor on May 10,
      1889. Tuesday fell on May 14 in 1889, so this date is confirmed.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00667_n2">2. In a letter to Richard
      Maurice Bucke dated May 12, 1889, Whitman mentions that he "went out in the
      wheel chair yesterday afternoon &amp; was probably out an hour and a half
      — everything 
      work'd
      
       well — the chair is a success &amp; sits and goes easy" (Letter
      to Richard Maurice Bucke, Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> Ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York UP,
      1969],4:33).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00667_n3">3. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) first met Whitman in 1860 while Whitman was in Boston
      correcting the proofs for the third edition of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>. Poet and short story writer, O'Connor had been approached by the
      Boston publishers Thayer &amp; Eldridge to write a novel. When Whitman came to
      Washington, DC, to find his brother George two years later, he stayed with the
      O'Connors and subsequently boarded with them for a few months. O'Connor became
      one of Whitman's good friends, and wrote <em>The Good Gray Poet: A
         Vindication</em> (1866) to defend Whitman when he was fired from his
      position as a clerk in the Indian Affairs Bureau because his supervisor found
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> objectionable. See Jerome Loving, <em>Walt Whitman's Champion: William Douglas O'Connor</em>
      (College Station, Texas, 1978).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00667_n4">4. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman
      (1842–1892) married George Whitman on April 14, 1871. They moved to Camden
      in 1872, and Walt Whitman lived with them from 1873–1884. See Karen Wolfe,
      "Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland, 1998), 781.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00667_n5">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the seventh child of Walter and Louisa Whitman, and ten
      years younger than Walt. George learned to read and write as a pupil under his
      older brother Walt (who briefly served as a schoolteacher in Long Island), and
      worked as a carpenter prior to his military service during the Civil War. When
      the war ended, he became a pipe inspector for the City of Camden and the New
      York Metropolitan Water Board. See Martin G. Murray, "Whitman, George
      Washington," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R.
      LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland, 1998), 777–78.<a href="#r5">[back]
