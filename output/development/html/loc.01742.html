      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your note to–day. I send you a note I have written to Mr. Edmunds<sup><a href="#loc.01742_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—first take it to Mr. Noyes,<sup><a href="#loc.01742_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> (to
      whom it is enveloped,) and get an additional line I have requested from him—&amp;
      then, if you conclude to try for the Carrier's place, go up &amp; take it yourself to
      Mr.
      Edmunds. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I must tell you another thing. I have written (wrote yesterday) a short note to Mr.
      Dubarry<sup><a href="#n0203" id="r3">3</a></sup>, your Superintendent, asking him if you couldn't be better
      placed, when the changes of the Baltimore connection are made. It may not amount to
      any
      thing, but I took a notion to write it. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, I am not having a very good time—My head troubles me—yesterday was as bad
      as ever—as far from well as ever—to–day I am a little easier, &amp; have
      been out a few steps. But I keep up a good heart, dear son—&amp; you must too. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>If you conclude not to try for the Carrier's berth, let the letters go. </p>
