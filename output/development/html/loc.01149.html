      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> That piece of writing of yours in the last "Critic" is to me very impressive.<sup><a href="#loc.01149_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> It is seldom you have fallen into such a noble &amp; lofty
      strain. As I am myself trying to write a little these days, it makes me sad. It is
      like a great ship that comes to windward of me &amp; takes the breeze out of the sail
      of my little shallop. I shall have to lay by today &amp; let the impression wear  off. I think you
      have hit it exactly with that word physiological. It lets in a flood of light. The
      whole essay is one to be long conned over.
   </p>  
   
   <p> I went down to N.Y. to hear Arnold<sup><a href="#loc.05536_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> on Emerson<sup><a href="#loc.01149_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Friday night. Curtis<sup><a href="#loc.01149_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—the
      pensive Curtis introduced the lecturer. I wonder if you have heard Curtis
      speak? Tis a pity he is not a little more robust &amp; manly. He fairly leans &amp;
      languishes on the bosom of the Graces, one after another. Arnold looked hearty &amp;
      strong &amp; spoke in a foggy, misty English voice, that left the outlining of his
      sentences pretty 
      obscure, but which had a certain charm after all. The lecture contained nothing new.
      The <u>Tribune</u> report you sent me, is an admirable
      summary—the pith of the whole lecture. He does not do full justice to Emerson
      as I hope to show in my essay. At least Emerson can be shorn of these things &amp;
      left a more impressive figure than Arnold leaves him. He had much to say about
      Carlyle<sup><a href="#n0139" id="r5">5</a></sup> too, but would not place him with the great
      writers! Because he was more than a great literary man he denied him literary
      honors. Drop me a line when you feel like it. Winter  is in full blush up here &amp; the
      river snores &amp; groans like an uneasy sleeper.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see

      critic Matthew Arnold (1822–1888) first came to America on a lecture tour
      in October, 1883, and remained until March, 1884. He "returned to England
      confirmed by experience in his conception of the average American as a hard
      uninteresting type of Philistine." After a second trip to the United States in
      the summer of 1886, Arnold commented on American life being "uninteresting, so
      without savour and without depth" (Stuart P. Sherman, <em>Matthew

      Having read Whitman's first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>,
      Emerson wrote a letter to Whitman, famously pronouncing him to be "at the
      beginning of a great career." In his response, Whitman eagerly addressed the
      Concord philosopher as "Master." Whitman published both Emerson's letter and his
