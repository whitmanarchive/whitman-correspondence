      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      I see by the Tribune of to-day
      that (by the hands of one of your "never
      dying audacious elected men"—is not
      that what you call them?) you have
      received another blow from the ignorance
      &amp; hypocrisy prevailing in our civilization
      on the subjects treated in your "Leaves 
      of Grass"—a civilization which nevertheless,
      one generation after another, confirms
      Rabelais as a classic, and swallows the
      Song of Solomon as Holy Scripture, instead
      of simply classing it with the 
      beautiful lays of Anacreon &amp; Swinburne
      and with the necessary text, more or 
      less, of all great literatures, none of
      which can possibly ignore an exhaustive
      survey of life and all its functions. And
      that this blow is going to deprive you of 
      what might be and ought to be a sufficient
      source of comfortable income to you in your
      declining years.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I have little time at present
      for correspondence outside of what is
      compelled by routine duties, but if you
      will put me in communication with some
      one of your friends good for such work, I
      
      
      
      
      will ask him to start a subscription
      for you, and will send him (or yourself
      directly if you prefer) twenty-five dollars,
      in the hope that some few at least of 
      appreciative men of means may subscribe
      those figures with a cipher or two 
      after them. Our big Masonic temple
      here, with perhaps a million dollars
      worth of material &amp; labor sunk in
      it, was built from a subscription
      started by a poor man with an offering 
      of one dollar.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I remember a buffet given you
      in former years by one of the Cabinet 
      Secretaries in whose Department you
      had been placed, and I suppose you,
      like all men &amp; women—poets or other—ahead
      of their time, have been well
      used to such, but, if a subscription
      were started in your behalf, it would,
      I think, be found that your "Leaves of
      Grass" have made friends for you, who
      would be glad to draw sympathy for you 
      and substantially forestall the unavailing
      gratitude (so far as Walt Whitman
      in the flesh is concerned) of posterity.
      
   </p>

      Yours always respectfully &amp; truly

      My name is not for publication, though if
      my subscription were for five thousand dollars, it might
      be well to give you the benefit of it.

      I wrote the within on Monday
      after reading a telegram
      about you in the Tribune, but I 
      did not note your address &amp; was 
      waiting for it when Mr O'Connor's letter
      in to-day's Tribune induced me to
      revert to its files to see whether your
      address had been mentioned. I 
      find it is still Camden.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      You perhaps remember calling 
      on me 3 or 4 years ago, when I lent
      you my diary of the war days from
      which to make excerpts about Lincoln.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      If you are in present straits, I will
      enclose you my little offering at once without
      waiting for a formal subscription.
