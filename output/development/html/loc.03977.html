      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have watched and waited for some friendly line from you, for about one month yet
      not a line have you pened. I suppose you have forgotten your rural friend, in the
      bustle and fashion of Boston life. I don't blame you very much; yet it seems
      to me that you would occasionally think of the loving times we have had in days gone
      by. I notice that is the way you always use me,
      but I will get square with you when I go off on my lecturing trip, not a line will
      I write you, and
      
      dont
      
       you forget it. Here I have been waiting in this dry and
      dusty office for some account of you and your happy [
      <span class="unclear">trip?</span>]
      , and this is the way you
      serve me is it. Well I have a new
      <u>gal</u> and 
       a mighty nice
      little thing she is too; just such a one as you would like, and I know if you were
      to see those pretty rosy lips you would be charmed beyond measure with them, yet you
      shan't see her now that you used me so. She is a wild rose, plucked from the
      [
      <span class="unclear">bosom?</span>]
       of the
      forest, pure as a lily, and gentle as the summer breezes.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother is unwell and
      has been for some time, she has to work too hard I think: she has 
      tryed
      
       to get some one to help her but it seems that she dont [
      <span class="unclear">succeed?</span>]
      
      very well. Hope she will be able to have some one ere long. Aunt Lizzie has been to
      see us twice since
      you were here, and is coming down to stay three or four days next week. Would like
      you
      to see her, think you would like her. Father is well as usual, and so we all are
      with the exception of mother. Hoping to see or hear from you soon. I am yours as
      ever,
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>â€”though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
