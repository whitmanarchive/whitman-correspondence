   <p>I have yours of 28th and 29th<sup><a href="#loc.07110_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> it came yesterday but was
      too much occupied to write. I got the paper you sent with the O.W. Holmes<sup><a href="#n3024" id="r2">2</a></sup>, "Atlantic Monthly" piece<sup><a href="#loc.07110_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>, but the
      paper did not have all there was abt you in the article. you should get the "A.M."
      itself.
   </p>
   
   
   <p><u>O.W.</u> is to all intents and purposes an Englishman (and a
      very good specimen too) Such a book as L.of G. and the mentality that goes with such
      a book is as far as possible from his ideal. The haughty, arrogant, masterful spirit
      of the poem evidently 
      repells
      
       him, while the insouciant freedom of L. of G. (perhaps the greatest charm
      of all) has no attraction for
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>him—I guess he likes books just as well as nature and<sup><a href="#loc.07110_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> would rather be in the house than outdoors.<sup><a href="#loc.07110_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>The Rejoinder slip<sup><a href="#loc.07110_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup> came in your last—I have read it
      again—of course you have said it all before (and more than once) but the
      children have not learned the lesson yet and there is no harm (even need) to
      repeat.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Beautiful Autumn weather here—warm or cool days and cool to cold nights, good
      for sleeping!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r7">7</a></sup> jogs on slowly. no one could imagine, unless
      they were mixed up in and had to do with it, the work there is in starting a new
      industry such as this—I fancy now that we shall do very little this year
      except <u>get going</u>—but after we <u>get going</u> I fancy we shall go lively

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      (1809–1894) was a Bostonian author, physician, and lecturer. One of the
      Fireside Poets, he was a good friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson as well as John
      Burroughs. Towards Whitman's poetry, Holmes remained ambivalent. He married
      Amelia Lee Jackson in 1840 and they had three children, including the later
      Supreme Court judge Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. For more information, see
