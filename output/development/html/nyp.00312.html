      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am getting along real well, upon the whole—I went out and over to the office yesterday—
      went in &amp; sat down at my desk a few minutes—It was my greatest effort yet, 
      and I was afraid I had overshot the mark again, as I felt dizzy &amp; tired last night—
      But to-day I feel getting along all right—I am going out a little to-day, but not
      much—
      I feel now over the worst of my bit of sickness, &amp; comparatively comfortable—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Poor Martha—the thoughts of her still come up in my mind, as I sit here 
      a great deal of the time alone—Poor Jeff, &amp; poor children too—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received a letter from Lillie Townsend<sup><a href="#nyp.00312_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Aunt Sally<sup><a href="#nyp.00312_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> is still living and well as usual, &amp; nothing very new—
      I have just got a second note from Mrs. Price—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I shall try to get out, &amp; get my Feb. pay, I have to get it from the old office,
      
      &amp; then I will send you your $20. (I hope within a couple of days, or three at most)—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I expect Mrs. Burroughs<sup><a href="#nyp.00312_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> here probably to-day with a carriage to 
      take me out riding—so you see I am beginning to sport around—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Every thing here now is <em>inauguration</em>—&amp; will be till the 4th of March is over—
      for my part I want to get out of the way of it all—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Love to you, mammy dear, &amp; to Georgey &amp; Lou &amp; all—
      <br></br>Walt.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00312_n1">1. Lillie Townsend was, like
      Priscilla Townsend, presumably a cousin of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (see Walt
      Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00312_n2">2. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's aunt, Sally Mead.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00312_n3">3. On March 2, 1873, Ursula
      Burroughs reported to her husband how much Walt Whitman had enjoyed the ride
      (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em>
      [Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1931], 81).<a href="#r3">[back]
