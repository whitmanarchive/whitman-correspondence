   <p>Nothing particular to write ab't. Pleasant weather now for over a week. I am much
      as
      usual, but cannot move around at all—Keep good spirits however &amp; am living
      comfortably enough—Of course lonesomeness &amp; bodily disability are
      dreadful, but things might be so much worse—Many cases of extreme suffering,
      poverty, sickness, old age &amp;c. around here lately—As I write I am sitting
      by the open window in the little front sitting room down stairs—Every thing is
      very quiet—the expressman is just taking over a big clay head to Phila: to be
      cast—modeled here by a sculptor<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Best love

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908),
      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0862">2. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
