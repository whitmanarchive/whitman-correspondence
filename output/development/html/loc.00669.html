      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Brother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>How very good you are to send me so much,—It was a great surprise, I 
      dont
      
       know what to say. I 
      wont
      
       try to say how grateful how much I feel your kindness
   </p>
   
   <p>What I fear is, you will have to deprive yourself of some needed comfort, and that
      worries me. Your kindness does me good, but Walt dear your health and your not
      having to feel anxious about your own needs would do me more good, your welfare and
      needs and <u>you</u> I think of, more than ever since I have been sick. I am
      not much sick now, feel pretty well most days. I gain but not as fast as I expected
      the worst
      is I cannot walk about much yet. am slow and very careful. have to be to become
      quite well. I sew &amp; do a little sitting still &amp; of course nothing like when I am
      well. I do not think it will be long before I shall be able to work again, as usual
      so you see Walt dear you need not feel in the least anxious I meant to have written,
      but supposed you thought me well, (I did not know 
      Charlie had written until your letter came) I
      was waiting to say I was well. I mean to write dear brother before long and tell you
      everything
   </p> 
   
   <p>You are very good to me to say you will come to see me It would be a great pleasure and
      comfort to see you. <u>it</u>
      <u>is</u>
      <u>a</u>
      <u>great</u> comfort to know you feel so much interest in me, but
      Walt dear I shall mind fearfully your spending more money on my account, let alone
      the risk to your health. that I think of most
   </p> 
   
   <p>To do me the most good is to take care
      of yourself. I should feel badly too, your not staying here, you have done much for
      me, it would
      be hard to not be able to do the least thing to make it pleasant for you to have you
      come when I get well, <u>that</u>
      <u>would</u>
      <u>be</u> something to look forward to.—I have always
      thought if I was dangerously sick, my greatest wish would be to see you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt dear about the money you have sent me I feel a little uneasy about your sparing
      so much. I felt bad
      yesterday. I feel afraid Charlie has been writing one of his conplaining letters.
      (I
      may be mistaken) I have asked him what he wrote, he gets angry, says its all right,
      must leave it to him, but Walt you must <u>never</u>
      <u>never</u> again send me money unless you have much more than
      you can use for your own needs. I have some money yet that you sent me that I had
      saved if needed I have used since I have been sick. I am grateful to Charlie for all
      he has done for me since I have been sick, but I wish he was different that he would
      tell me when he writes to you, I knew he wrote to you yesterday,—not what he wrote.
      he has gone out to take a long walk this afternoon. I am alone, my being sick has
      been bad for him I know
