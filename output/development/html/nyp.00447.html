      liver, other causes—malarial &amp;c—I

   <p id="nyp.00447_n2">2. Whitman suffered from a
      liver disorder from October 17 to 28 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). Dr. Dowling Benjamin, his physician, began to
      practice medicine in Camden in 1877; see George R. Prowell, <em>The History of Camden County, New Jersey</em> (1886). A newspaper report
      alarmed the poet's friends: "Walt Whitman is so seriously ill of Bright's
      disease that few if any hopes for his recovery are entertained." See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [Philadelphia:
      University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953], 4:322–323, and Jeff's letter to
      his brother on .<a href="#r2">[back]
