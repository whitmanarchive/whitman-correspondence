   <p>Tommy,<sup><a href="#duk.00777_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> your letter come to hand this evening, &amp; I will just scratch off a few lines to
      answer at once—for I am ever so glad to know you have not forgot me, as I have
      not you, Tommy boy. I heard by some London boy I met quite a while ago that you was
      married &amp; I supposed since you had your hands full of business, new associations
      &amp;c.
   </p>
   
   <p>Tom, I will just tell you about things—I still live in the same quarters in
      Camden, but shall soon break up permanently from here. I keep pretty well—feel
      as well as when I last saw you, &amp; I suppose look 
      ab't
      
       the same—(perhaps grayer &amp; redder)—though young enough <em>in spirit</em> &amp; now in my 65th year, I could easily pass for
      75 or so—Ups and downs of course, but I thank God I have had two pretty good
      years—&amp; especially this past summer (which has been a remarkably fine one
      here.) My two books bring me in a moderate income<sup><a href="#duk.00777_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I am satisfied with very plain living—&amp; bless the Lord I am
      likely to have enough for that as long as I need—
   </p>
   
   <p>Tom, give my best regards to your wife, for all I have no acquaintance with her
      yet—I wish to be remembered to any of the Asylum boys I knew there who yet
      remain—I remember well the kindness of them all, &amp; the gay old rides
      around—Tom, do you recollect that Sunday evening you drove the women in town
      to church, &amp; we had a sociable drive all around?—that was the time we
      first got acquainted—I have been thinking a good while of coming on to visit
      Dr Bucke again, &amp; then I will come &amp; see you<sup><a href="#duk.00777_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—God bless you, Tommy boy—
   </p>
