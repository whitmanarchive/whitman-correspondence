      This letter's envelope bears the address, "Mrs. E. M. O'Connor | 1015 O
      st—near 11th N. W. | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden |
      (?)| 7(?)| N.J."<br><br>
      This and Whitman's  letter to Peter Doyle
      can be assigned to 1874 because of the particularized descriptions of
      Whitman's physical symptoms, which are elaborated upon in Whitman's  letter to Ellen O'Connor and his  letter to Peter Doyle, both of which can
      definitely be assigned to 1874. <a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00339_n3">3. Whitman probably refers
