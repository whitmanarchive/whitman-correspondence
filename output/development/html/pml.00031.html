   <p>Well, mama dear, Christmas day is finished, &amp; I thought I would just send you a line—We
      have had a mild day, as warm as spring—I took dinner at O'Connor's by invitation—we
      had an excellent dinner—I am invited to Dr. Channings<sup><a href="#pml.00031_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> this evening, but I hardly feel like going, &amp; shall not go—They are very clever people,
      &amp; have invited me to Newport next summer—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am writing this in the office, (alone in my own room)—I have just time to catch
      the mail—I hope you have had a nice Christmas, mama dear—May be George &amp; Lou are with
      you—(I hope you will all take a glass of the Spanish wine)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I believe I told you in my last that I wrote to Martha and Han—Good bye, mama dear,
      for this time, &amp; Love to you &amp; Lou &amp; all—
   </p>

   <p>Mother, I will send the order in my next—The bells are all ringing for 7 oclock church—there
      is a chime of bells in one of the churches—they are playing an old hymn tune—it sounds
      good—it is a beautiful moonlight night—
