      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am back only a few days from a 3 weeks trip to Canada.<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r1">1</a></sup> The morning after my return some wretch poisoned my dog &amp; the loss has quite up set me. I have not been my self since. Then I am out of sorts in body &amp; wife is away under the doctors care, so that
      I am not having a very good time. We traveled—Mr. Johns &amp; me—about 2300 miles, &amp; excepting
      a week spent in the woods
      
      
      north of Quebec, the trip was a good deal of a bore. We went by way of Boston &amp; I
      ran about there some, I called on Gurnsey<sup><a href="#n0836" id="r2">2</a></sup> of the Boston Herald &amp; found him a very likable young man—in fact a thoroughly good
      fellow. He said he had written to you, but had rec<u>d</u> no reply yet. I told him you were probably away in the country. I liked the looks
      of Boston much. We poked about Cambridge some &amp; then went over to Concord &amp; passed
      a night there. I found Mr Sanborn<sup><a href="#n0915" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; was cordially rec<u>d</u>. I had seen him the day before in Boston. I like Sanborn all except his lofty coldness
      &amp; reserve. It seems to be the style out there to affect ignorance of every thing you
      are interested in
      
      
      He showed us the home &amp; some of the haunts of Thoreau, &amp; then his grave &amp; that of
      Hawthorne. He took me to see Alcott<sup><a href="#n0741" id="r4">4</a></sup> whom I liked. Alcott praised my Emerson piece, but Sanborn appeared not to know anything
      about my writings. We were at Alcotts only a few minutes. He spoke in a friendly way
      about you &amp;c. We passed <u>by</u> Emersons house &amp; I admired his wood pile, I did not feel like calling upon him of
      my own motion. Alcott said he was well. I liked Concord, but I don't see how any great
      thing can come out of that place.
   </p> 
   
   <p>I got the Library Table with Blood's sanguinary review of my book.<sup><a href="#n0837" id="r5">5</a></sup> It is very petty criticism &amp; I think I can stand it better than Blood can. He evidently
      
      
      wanted to pitch into my Eagle, but was afraid of the claws. I hope I shall see you
      soon, as I <u>must</u> go to W. this month unless the heat is too oppressive. Write me how &amp; where you are.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0129">1. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0836">2. As is clear from the letter, Fred
      R. Guernsey was associated with the <em>Boston Herald</em>. In
      1882 the newspaper supported Whitman against the Boston censors, and quoted
      Oscar Wilde's defense (Edwin Haviland Miller, <em>Walt Whitman:
         The Correspondence</em>, [New York: New York University Press], 3:283
      n73).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0915">3. Franklin B. Sanborn
      (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
      he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
      the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
      reviewed <em>Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Boston
         Commonwealth</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00059.html">February 24, 1866</a>. He was editor of the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
      his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
      appeared without Sanborn's name in the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K. Walker,
      "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_206.html">Sanborn, Franklin Benjamin (Frank) (1831–1917)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0741">4. Amos Bronson Alcott
      (1799–1888) was an American educator, abolitionist, and father of Louisa
      May Alcott (1832–1888), whose 1868 novel <em>Little
         Women</em> (loosely based on the Alcott home) secured the financial
      stability her father had been unable to achieve through his own work as a
      teacher and transcendentalist. See also <em>The Journals of
         Bronson Alcott</em>, ed. Odell Shepard (Boston: Little, Brown, 1938),
      286–290.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0837">5. Here Burroughs is referring to the
      review of his <em>Birds and Poets</em> written by critic Henry
      Amos Blood (1836–1900), published in <em>Library Table</em>
      3:7 (19 July 1877), 107-109, and titled "Essays on Rural Topics." In it, Blood
      criticized some of Burroughs's extreme claims for Whitman but also noted the
      poet's virtues of sublimity and use of chiaroscuro, with "mostly superb
      passages."<a href="#r5">[back]
