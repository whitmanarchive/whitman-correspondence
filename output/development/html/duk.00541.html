   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00541_n16">1. This letter dates to March
      24, 1868. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's date, "March 24" and "Tuesday," are
      consistent with 1868, the year Richard Maurice Bucke assigned to the letter.
      Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's year (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:365). March 24, 1868 is consistent both with Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's recent receipt of the <em>Galaxy</em> issue that
      featured William D. O'Connor's "Ballad of Sir Ball" and with the distribution of
      Fanny Van Nostrand's estate after her death.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00541_n7">2. Neither of these letters
      from Walt Whitman to his mother, the one received on March 20, 1868
      (Friday), or the one received on March 24, 1868, is extant. Edwin Haviland
      Miller dated the two missing Whitman letters March 19 and March 23, 1868
      (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:360).<br><br>
      Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest
      daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt
      Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in
      1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport, Long Island. They raised
      five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and Mary Isadore "Minnie."
      See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975), 10–11.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00541_n6">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      had written the previous month, "i think we will get the galaxy and see Oconors
      peice" (see her  letter to Walt
      Whitman). See William D. O'Connor, "The Ballad of Sir Ball," <em>The Galaxy</em> 5 (March 1868), 328–333. O'Connor had recommended
      Whitman to William C. Church and Francis P. Church, publishers of the <em>Galaxy</em>. For Whitman's work in the magazine, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_title/per.00102.html"><em>The Galaxy</em></a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00541_n18">4. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      sense that Mary Van Nostrand's daughter Mary Isadore "Minnie" was indulged was
      reaffirmed the following year. Mary requested a week-long visit for shopping in
      preparation for Minnie's approaching marriage (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">5. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00541_n8">6. Fanny Van Nostrand, called
      "Aunt Fanny" in the letters of Walt Whitman and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, is
      the mother of Ansel Van Nostrand, who married Walt Whitman's younger sister
      Mary. Mary Van Nostrand had written on February 16, 1868 that Ansel's mother
      "cannot live." Louisa reported Aunt Fanny's recent death in this letter.
      Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver tentatively dated Mary Van Nostrand's letter
      to 1867, but Louisa's  letter to
      Walt dates firmly to 1868, so Gohdes and Silver's provisional date for Mary's
      letter is incorrect. Louisa had written in her  letter that "i have heard nothing from aunt fanny i suppos
      she is living yet," which is consistent with a report on a genealogy site that
      Fanny Van Nostrand died on March 9, 1868, two weeks before this letter (see
      http://www.longislandsurnames.com). For Walt Whitman's remark on Aunt Fanny, see
      his  letter to Louisa.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00541_n2">7. Fanny Van Nostrand's money
      was divided among Ansel Van Nostrand, Ansel and Mary Van Nostrand's son George,
      and Ansel's brother Noah Van Nostrand.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00541_n9">8. Much of the remainder of
      this letter to Walt Whitman, through granddaughter Manahatta's response to a
      package, summarizes Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's March 20, 1868 letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1977], 51–53).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">9. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">10. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">11. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r11">[back]

   <p id="duk.00440_n3">12. Manahatta Whitman
      (1860–1886), known as "Hattie," was the daughter of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven years of her life in
      the same home with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was especially close to her
      grandmother. Hattie and her younger sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957) were
      both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r12">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00541_n13">14. Earlier in the month Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman had written "a pressing letter to hannah urging her to come
      and make us a visit" (see Louisa's 
      letter to Walt Whitman). Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908),
      Louisa's youngest daughter, resided in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles
      L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter.<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00541_n5">15. Charles L. Heyde "charley
      hay" was the husband of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's daughter Hannah Louisa
      (Whitman) Heyde, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont. Louisa no doubt
      anticipated that requesting a visit from Hannah would upset Heyde, who was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. Louisa in her  letter to Walt Whitman wrote that Heyde "is a very bad man
      very very."<br><br>
