   <p>I am immensely pleased (tickled) with the result of my little Wifekin Dame Kennedy's<sup><a href="#loc.03053_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> visit to
      you. She has read yr books &amp; Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> ever since she has
      returned. She was <u>finally</u> converted by the impression made
      by your personal presence. Says she felt that strange thrill (caused by yr great
      magnetism) that so many others have felt. She wrote to=day a tremendous arraingment
      of the Leslie Nutter I told you of. She hauled him over the coals finely. I rubbed
      my hands in glee after quoting some of the good great fellows (in England &amp;
      America) who stand up for W. W. &amp; love him she says, "Thoreau<sup><a href="#hun.00052_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> thinks he is a great fellow, &amp; I think so, too." She says, "I saw
      with my own eyes, his nobility &amp; manners," &amp;c. She thoroughly understands and
      approves yr Children of Adam poems, too! Sees their noble purpose.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>She doesn't <u>need</u> you so much as I did, though, for she has
      always been a liberated spirit. Her father &amp; grandfather were deists.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I tell you she's a rare little soul, I wish you knew how keenly she pierces to the
      heart of shams &amp; humbugs.
      Yet generous enough to forgive everybody. Tears spring to her eyes at the recital
      of
      some noble heroic deed. All unfortunates flock to her.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.03053_n1">1. Kennedy had married Adeline Ella Lincoln (d. 1923) of Cambridge, Massachusetts,
      on June 17, 1883. The couple's son Mortimer died in infancy.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
