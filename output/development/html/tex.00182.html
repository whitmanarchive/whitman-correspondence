   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just rec'd your letter—I thought of you during that storm—it was very severe
      here too, 
      &amp; awful gales of wind one or two nights—The dinner in the Hospital<sup><a href="#tex.00182_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      was a complete success—there was plenty, &amp; good too—turkey &amp; four or five kinds of
      vegetables, &amp; mince pie, &amp;c—then I purchased a large quantity of navy plug, &amp; smoking
      tobacco, &amp; pipes, &amp;c. and after dinner
      every body that wanted to, had a good smoke—&amp; I had a lot of oranges, apples, &amp;c.
      &amp; a large sugar cake for supper—then I read some amusing pieces to them for three
      quarters of an hour, for a change—&amp; sat down by those who were worst off—&amp;c. &amp;c. Nobody
      else came in that day. 
      They have a Chaplain, but he is miserable coot, like the rest of his tribe.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have written again to Han—
      I am writing this in the office, all alone—I am going down to the Hospital for a little
      while, &amp; to carry some tobacco—&amp; then I am invited to O'Connor's to dinner at 4 o'clock—we
      are to have cold turkey, hot vegetables, &amp;c—They are going to stay where they are
      till next March. 
      We have had quite a snow storm here—it is snowing moderately now. 
      Some are out with their sleighs. I am glad to hear such a good account of Eddy.
      It makes me feel quite satisfied.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had a visit from Bayard Taylor,<sup><a href="#tex.00182_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> a few days since.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well good bye for this time, dear mother.</p>

   <p id="tex.00182_n1">1. Walt Whitman wrote of
      preparations for this dinner, including a collection effort, in his  letter to his mother.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="tex.00182_n2">2. Bayard Taylor
      (1825–1878), translator of <em>Faust</em>, journalist, and
      traveler, had sent a copy of his poem "The Picture of St. John" to Walt Whitman
      in a  letter, to which Whitman
      responded in a  letter to Taylor.
      In the November 12 letter, Taylor commended Whitman's "remarkable powers of
      expression" and "deep and tender reverence for Man." His letter  was even more unreserved in its
      praise of Whitman. Later Taylor's enthusiasm for Whitman was to change
      dramatically. In <em>The Echo Club</em> (2d ed., 1876),
      154–158, 168–169, Taylor burlesqued Whitman's poetry. In his <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> (1896), William Sloane
      Kennedy lists Taylor among Whitman's "Bitter and Relentless Foes and 
      Cillifiers
