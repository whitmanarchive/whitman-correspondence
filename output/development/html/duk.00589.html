   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00589_n8">1. This letter dates to March
      24, 1870. The date 24 is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard
      Maurice Bucke assigned the date March 24, 1870. Edwin Haviland Miller accepted
      Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). The letter was written just
      after the death of Jesse Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son. Though Louisa
      does not refer to Jesse by name, she identifies him as her "first born" and says
      that he is to be buried in a "paupers grave." Jesse died in the Kings County
      Lunatic Asylum on March 21, 1870.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00589_n11">2. Jesse Whitman
      (1818–1870) died at Kings County Lunatic Asylum on March 21, 1870. Walt
      Whitman was notified of his brother's death (see E. Warner's  letter), and Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was either notified at the same time or received notice from Walt. Jesse
      had suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence for several
      years before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in December
      1864. Shortly after an outburst that followed his brother Andrew Jackson
      Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened Martha Mitchell and Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in some
      hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see Jeff's  to Walt Whitman). Louisa resisted
      institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her  letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put
      him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic
      Asylum on Flatbush Avenue. For a short biography of Jesse, see Robert Roper,

   <p id="duk.00422_n2">3. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00438_n4">4. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n2">5. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
