   <p>Your friendly note of the 26th has just come to hand, and yesterday your noble paper on Personalism—for both of which attentions you have my thanks. I shall look for your views of the
      aboriginal literature, fully believing that your thought is on the track of Empire
      and sees the route to Personal Power for the nation, as for the individual. And never
      a people needed more the Cosmic thought to inspire and guide its action.
   </p>
   <p>Yet think of the progress out of the twilight since your star dawned upon our hazy
      horizon.
   </p>
   <p>Some friend has sent me from time to time appreciative notices of yourself, knowing
      by some supreme instinct my hope in whatever promises expansion for our hemisphere.
      You, too, kindly inform me of particulars about your personal position and prosperity.
      I am interested in all you choose to communicate.
   </p>
   <p>Emerson is just home from your city of steeples and stocks, but I have not spoken with him yet. I know how fully he shares in my appreciation
      of yourself and works.

   <p>Please accept the sketch accompanying this, and oblige</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Amos Bronson Alcott
      (1799–1888) was an American educator, abolitionist, and father of Louisa
      May Alcott (1832–1888), whose 1868 novel <em>Little
         Women</em> (loosely based on the Alcott home) secured the financial
      stability her father had been unable to achieve through his own work as a
      teacher and transcendentalist. See also <em>The Journals of
         Bronson Alcott</em>, ed. Odell Shepard (Boston: Little, Brown, 1938),
      286–290.
