      <br></br><br></br>Bro Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Just recieved Springfield paper, with extended notices of Walt Whitman. Came
      opportunely, for Han was growing nervous not recieveing any letter or card from you.
      She
      sprang right up, renewed, although she is not very strong as yet. And I was glad too,
      I assure you. Han is steadily improving; rather weakly and gray, but ambitious and
      systematic.
   </p> 
   
   <p>I have been dreadfull sick too, but can now breathe nearly as well as usual. Every
      body congratulates me.
   </p>
   
   <p>We was as glad to learn that you are so comfortable with widow Davis:<sup><a href="#duk.00404_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Han says
      she would so like
      to see her and talk with her: and so  would I tell her so. My father was
      a sea captain; sailed from Philadelphia to France was wrecked, lost at sea: 
      rember
      
       both of us to her: But what is the matter with Geo and Lou.<sup><a href="#n1046" id="r2">2</a></sup> I sent a small
      painting to them some months ago, framed, at 15 dollars with request to return it
      if
      not agreeable: have written twice, but recieved no reply.
   </p>
   
   <p>Perhaps Geo is short of cash; still they keep the picture view from our house, with
      the Lake (Battery view) where you used to stroll. [
      <span class="unclear">Warm?</span>]
       Han has large room up stairs to herself.
      I have small room adjoining: that I can hear, if she needs any thing: she is down
      stairs every day—cooks, I make fire etc—Han sends
      love—talks of you.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a French-born
      landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman (1823–1890), Walt
      Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_96.html">Heyde, Charles Louis (1822–1892)</a>," <em>Walt
