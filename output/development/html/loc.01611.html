   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edwin Einstein (1842–1905) was a tobacconist
      and a friend of Walt Whitman's from the Pfaffian days of the 1850s. The <em>Trow's New York City Directory</em> of 1860 listed an Edwin
      Einstein as "clerk, h 167 W. 14th," while in 1877, the <em>Gouldings New York City Directory</em> listed an Edwin Einstein as
      "tobacco, 87 Water." Einstein was later elected to a brief stint in the House of
      Representatives as a Republican for New York from 1879 to 1881. Einstein wrote
      to Walt Whitman on , from the
      Union League Club, Madison Avenue and Twenty-sixth Street, New York: "I would
      not trouble you with this letter, were it not that I saw mentioned in the N. Y.
      Sun the other day the fact that you were in very needy circumstances, if that is
      so will you let me know, and myself and a few other of your old friends would be
      glad to aid you to the best of our ability. If it is not so, (which I sincerely
      trust may be the case) pardon the liberty I am taking and believe it is only
      done out of friendship and good will."
