   <p id="cor.00003_n1">1. This postal card is
      addressed: Edwin H Woodruff | Cornell University Library | Ithaca | New York. It
      is postmarked: CAMDEN | DEC | 21 | 8 PM | 188[illegible] | N.J.; [illegible] | DEC | 22 | 7 PM | [illegible]D.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="cor.00003_n2">2. The year in which
      Whitman's postcard to Woodruff was written is conjectural, but 1886 seems
      plausible, based on the timing of Woodruff's visit to Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
