   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00810_n1">1. H. Rowlandson's review of
      Carpenter's <em>Towards Democracy</em> appeared in the <em>Dublin University Review</em> in April. The article was
      actually written by Thomas W. H. Rolleston; see his letter to Whitman of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00810_n2">2. On April 24 Whitman had a
      "planked shad &amp; champagne dinner at Billy Thompson's" (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). William J. "Billy"
      Thompson (1848–1911), known as "The Duke of Gloucester" and "The
      Statesman," was a friend of Whitman's who operated a hotel, race track, and
      amusement park on the beach overlooking the Delaware River at Gloucester, New
      Jersey. His shad and champagne dinners for Whitman were something of a
      tradition. See William Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt
         Whitman</em> (1896), 15–16.<a href="#r2">[back]
