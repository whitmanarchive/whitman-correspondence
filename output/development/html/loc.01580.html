      <br></br><br></br>Dear son,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall return on Monday next, in the 12:30 train from Jersey city—(the train I
      usually come in)— Pete, I have rec'd your letter of 26th—Mother<sup><a href="#n0705" id="r1">1</a></sup> seems
      to-day full as well as usual—I continue all right— I have been on to New
      Haven, about 75 miles from here—a former friend of mine Charles Hine, a painter to whom Whitman wrote on
      . On August 4, 1871,
       Mrs. Hine
      informed Walt Whitman of her husband's death: "I think after your visit to him
      that his hold on life seemed to give way and his yearnings were all
      accomplished" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1964), 5 vols.,
      III, 330). Mrs. Hine, who visited Louisa Van Velsor Whitman Whitman on August
      22, 1871, thought it "strange" that Walt Whitman did not write (Trent
      Collection, Duke University). According to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter of
      September 30, 1871,
       Mrs.
      Hine had received a "donation" from Walt Whitman (Trent Collection, Duke
      University). Whitman also wrote of Charles Hine's illness in his , letter to William O'Connor.
       is in a dying condition there, from consumption, &amp; expressed such a
      strong desire to see me, that I went on—I thought he would die while I was
      there— he was all wasted, to a skeleton, faculties good, but voice only a low
      whisper—I returned last night, after midnight— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, bub, my time here is short—I have had a good quiet visit—the best
      in some respects yet— &amp; I feel satisfied—My darling son, we will
      very soon be together again— 
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
