      <br></br><br></br>Dear old Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> A wish has suddenly and quite spontaneously sprung up in England amongst your
      readers to in some part pay off the debt owed every poet &amp; especially to you. I hope
      that you may see your way to letting this little bud blossom. I shall proceed no
      further in this until I hear from you: trusting that you will not deprive
      England of this honour. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I could not well write to you before as the scheme was so sudden and
      spontaneous. 
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p> I think that you will like Wedmore,<sup><a href="#loc.02188_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> he is coming to
      call upon you in September. Wedmore is about the best critical writer in London
      and quite the best of his kind. Although precise and neat his mind moves with
      freedom as a candid mind should. Our friend is somewhat of a butterfly though I
      have always found a staunch friend in Wedmore, in short I like him. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I fear me that you do not take such pleasure in Glendale<sup><a href="#loc.02188_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> as you did in Kirkwood
      I do not hear of your being there much. I am sorry Ruthie has married so
      young,<sup><a href="#loc.02188_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> it means a long hard life probably in the
      country. Her mother too has no one to help her. My mother's health is but sadly,
      but it is 
      wonderful what she manages to do, continuing always to think and work for
      others, herself last. My sister's voice is developing and her art is beginning
      to be admired.<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r4">4</a></sup> I am in excellent health and spirits. My
      picture in this year's Royal Academy was a good deal noticed, and has done my
      reputation good: in fact I am getting on my feet, slowly. I am rather hankering
      after a studio right down in the city amongst men: From a business point of view
      it is fatal not be central, and besides I love the Strand, Oh! how you would
      too, sort of human Delaware river.

      view to presenting a free-will offering to the American poet Walt Whitman. The

      maintained himself precariously by the sale of his works in poetry and prose,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02188_n1">1. Frederick Wedmore
      (1844–1921) was a theater critic and scholar from England. He was also a
      neighbor of the Gilchrists. Whether he really met Whitman that fall (as was
      planned) is unclear.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02188_n3">2. The Staffords had moved to
      Glendale, New Jersey, a few miles from their farm at Timber Creek (in Laurel
      Springs, close to Kirkwood), where Whitman had frequently visited in the late
      1870s and early 1880s.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02188_n2">3. Probably a reference to Ruth
      Stafford Goldy (1866–1939), the sister of Whitman's close friend Harry
      Stafford. She had married in August of 1884 at the age of 18.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0890">4. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">5. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
