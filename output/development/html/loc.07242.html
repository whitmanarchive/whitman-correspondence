   <p>All quiet here and another perfect autumn day. Your card of 13th came this morning.
      I
      think it is wonderful how perfect your handwriting keeps through all your illness
      and feebleness. No I would not recommend Froude's<sup><a href="#loc.07242_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      Carlyle<sup><a href="#n4301" id="r3">3</a></sup> to a man who needed cheering up. I read it a few
      years ago and it nearly gave me an attack of melancholia. I look upon that same
      Carlyle as being (or having been?) one of the worst "cranks" that ever lived. And
      he
      certainly had about as bad a time of it  for 86 years as any man ever had in this
      world. Nothing gave him pleasure, nearly everything gave him pain. As long as his
      wife lived her presence only seemed to add to his worry and gloom; as soon as she
      was dead he was more gloomy and worried more than ever because he had lost her! He
      was a bad sample and she was little (if any?) better. He couldn't even live with his
      favorite brother John! I think his ignorant old mother with her pipe was the best
      of the lot;
      think I could have liked her—I shall like to know C. by &amp; by to see what
      he is like in the next world but I never expect to care much about him!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07242_n2">2. James Anthony Froude
      (1818–1894) was an English historian, biographer, and editor of <em>Fraser's Magazine</em>. Froude was also a close friend and
      literary executor to Thomas Carlyle, after whose death Froude published a
      biography entitled <em>Life of Carlyle</em>, which described
      Carlyle's intellectual accomplishments as well as his personal failings, in
      particular his unhappy relationship with his wife, Jane Welsh. Froude had
      previously published Jane's writings in <em>Letters and Memorials
         of Jane Welsh Carlyle</em> in 1883 to much protest from Carlyle's surviving
      family, and his biography of Carlyle emphasized his conflicted marriage for
      contemporary readers. For more on Froude, see Ciarán Brady, <em>James Anthony Froude: An Intellectual Biography of a Victorian
         Prophet</em> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013).<a href="#r2">[back]
