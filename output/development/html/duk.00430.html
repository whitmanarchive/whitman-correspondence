   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00430_n13">1. 
      This letter dates either to September 25 or October 2, 1863. Richard Maurice
      Bucke assigned the letter to a Friday in November 1863 on an accompanying
      slip of paper held in the Trent Collection (not reproduced here). Edwin
      Haviland Miller assigned this letter the approximate date October 5, 1863 on
      the basis of Walt Whitman's writing "Mother, you dont know how pleased I was
      to read what you wrote about little sis," apparently in response to Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's remark that Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha
      Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's daughter Jessie Louisa was "well and fat" though
      her older sister Manahatta was "obstropolous" (see Walt's  letter to Louisa). Miller's
      date is more accurate than Bucke's, but since Louisa wrote on a Friday, the
      date proposed by Miller should be changed to the most recent Friday before
      Walt's letter, October 2.<br><br>
      The letter may date to even a week earlier, September 25. Walt in his  letter to Louisa reassured
      her about Union generals Ambrose Burnside and George Gordon Meade, and Walt
      may well have responded directly to Louisa's concern that "rebels will get
      the better of Burny" and her wish that "mead was removed." However, Walt had
      also discussed Burnside (but not Meade) in his  letter to Louisa. He also yearned regularly
      for news about Mattie and Jeff, their daughters, and Walt's brother Andrew
      Jackson Whitman. The matter of Burnside and Meade is suggestive but not
      conclusive. The earliest possible date for this letter derives from the
      distance since Andrew's most recent acute episode of illness—Louisa's
      remarks suggest some improvement in his eating—and the specificity of
      Walt's many queries: whether soldiers remain on Fort Greene and whether she,
      Louisa, could forward copies of the Brooklyn newspapers, the <em>Union</em> and the <em>Eagle</em>. As
      Andrew's acute episode of illness had passed and this letter addresses
      neither of Walt's queries, this letter is unlikely to date to the Friday
      immediately following Walt's September 15 letter or earlier. This letter may
      follow Louisa's 
      letter to Walt, but that too is a matter of interpretation. The Friday
      preceding the date proposed by Miller, October 2, 1863, is more probable,
      but September 25, 1863 is also possible.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00430_n2">2. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and his wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman. Jeff consulted with Ruggles on Andrew Whitman's illness (see
      Jeff's  letter to Walt
      Whitman).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00430_n3">3. The "young ones" are
      Manahatta "Hattie" (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" Whitman
      (1863–1957), the daughters of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha
      Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. Hattie and Jessie were both favorites of their uncle
      Walt.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00430_n12">5. Louisa may refer to a shoe
      that produces the sluff sound or to an old cast-off (sluffed off) shoe. Walt
      Whitman counted the "sluff of bootsoles" among the sounds that form the "blab of
      the pave" (<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/LG/1855/whole.html"><em>Leaves of Grass</em> [1855]</a>).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00430_n5">6. The Brown family began
      boarding in the same house as the Whitmans on Portland Avenue, Brooklyn in April
      1860. The relationship between the Browns and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's
      family was often strained, but the Browns remained in the Portland Avenue house
      for five years. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman maintained a cordial relationship with
      the Browns after Jeff and his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman departed for
      St. Louis. Years later Louisa called on Mrs. Brown and remarked to Walt Whitman,
      "if Jeff and matt knew i had been to see mrs Brown they would cross me off their
      books" (see her  letter).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00430_n6">7. Andrew Jackson Whitman
      (1827–1863) was Walter Whitman, Sr., and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son
      and Walt Whitman's brother. He was married to Nancy McClure Whitman. Andrew and
      his wife Nancy had had two sons, James "Jimmy" and George "Georgy," and Nancy
      was pregnant with a son, Andrew, Jr., when her husband died in 1863. At the time
      of this letter, Andrew was ill with a throat ailment that led to his death
      within two months (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman). In the early 1860s, Andrew had worked as
      a carpenter, and he enlisted briefly in the Union Army during the Civil War (see
      Martin G. Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 10 [Winter 1993],
      142–148).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">8. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n11">9. Jesse Whitman
      (1818–1870) was the first-born son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr. He suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence
      for several years before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in
      December 1864. Shortly after an outburst that followed his brother Andrew
      Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened Martha Mitchell and
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in
      some hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see Jeff's  to Walt Whitman). Louisa resisted
      institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her  letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put
      him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic
      Asylum on Flatbush Avenue, where he remained until his death on March 21, 1870
      (see E. Warner's  letter to Walt).

      (1824–1881) rose to the rank of major general in March 1862 and was
      charged with reinforcing George B. McClellan's Army of the Potomac. After
      McClellan's removal in November 1862, Burnside assumed command. Burnside was
      soundly defeated in the Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862), a demoralizing
      defeat for Union forces at which Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son George
      Washington Whitman was wounded. Burnside was removed from command of the Army of
      the Potomac and in March 1863 assumed command of the Department of Ohio, under
      which George and his regiment, the Fifty-first New York Volunteers, was serving
      at the time of this letter (see Michael C. C. Adams, "Burnside, Ambrose
      Everett," <em>American National Biography Online</em>; also see

      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
