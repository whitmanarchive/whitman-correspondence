   <p>Yours rec'd this morning. Thanks for sending the books. Please duly send same address the Finance
      Rep't for 1874 when printed.
      Glad to get the item about Symonds's book<sup><a href="#nyu.00005_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—shall look for it. I am better—still head wavering, &amp; stomach qualmish, but fainter
      spells &amp; at longer
      intervals—am having to-day, &amp; as I write, very tolerable conditions—
   </p>

      This postcard bears the address, "Chas. W. Eldridge | Internal Revenue Bureau
      | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Dec | 8 | N.J.; Carrier | 9
      | Dec | 6 (?) AM."<br><br>
      This postcard deals with the same material as that in Whitman's  letter to Eldridge.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyu.00005_n2">2. Whitman refers here to
      John Addington Symonds' <em>Studies of the Greek Poets</em>
      (London: Smith, Elder, &amp; Co., 1873–1876), in which Whitman was lauded
      as "more thoroughly Greek than any man of modern times."<a href="#r2">[back]
