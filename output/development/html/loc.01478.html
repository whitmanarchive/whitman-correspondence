      like to write a line (quite purposeless no doubt) sending my love &amp; thanks to

      present through you of the horse &amp; wagon? And much, much good has it done me

   <p>—I remain in health much as usual, of late—Shall come over &amp; spend
      a couple of hours with you soon. Shall send you a postal day before.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Donaldson
      (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
      introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
      the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
      carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt
         Whitman, the Man</em> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see

         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
