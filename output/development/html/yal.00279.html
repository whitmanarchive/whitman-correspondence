   <p> Forgive my not writing before. Much of the time, I cannot write, from paralysis.
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Very soon in 1876 I issue a small edition of my complete works in two volumes. <u>Leaves of Grass</u> will be one. The other, <u>Two Rivulets</u>, alternations of prose &amp; verse—the
      themes 
      ab't
      
       as diverse as they can be—poetry, politics, the war, &amp;c—
      (I kept a diary from 1862–'65, scenes in Virginia, Washington, &amp;c. the
      hospital, camps, battles &amp;c. here given almost verbatim.) I publish &amp; shall
      sell the volumes myself, for two good reasons. No established publisher in the
      country will print my books, &amp; during the last three years of my illness &amp;
      helplessness every one of the three successive book agents I have had in N.Y. has
      embezzled the proceeds. 
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p> To sum up the situation at present: My health &amp; strength are probably
      irrecoverable—still I may endure some years yet—mind
      unaffected—spirits good—keep up about one third of the time, prostrated
      partially or wholly the other two thirds—pecuniary matters then &amp; meagre,
      (but not in want)—shall probably reside steadily here in Camden. 
   </p>
   
   <p> And now good bye, &amp; happy New Year to you my friend. Though this letter itself
      is not intended for publication, you are at liberty to use any or all the statements
      in it should you have occasion under your own judgement.

   <p> One of the first of the proof copies sent out at all shall be to you. A great
      part of <u>Two Rivulets</u>, prose &amp; poetry, is fresh
      matter, hitherto unpublished.
