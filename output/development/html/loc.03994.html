      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy Harry,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter 
      rec'd
      
       to-day,—I am sorry you didn't go in &amp; read the piece your
      own self—it has got to be done, speaking in public, &amp; the more you hang
      back &amp; dread it, the worse it grows—after trying it on once or twice, you
      find it is nothing to be afraid of—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been busy all the forenoon fixing one of my little pieces <u>"How I get around at 60 and take notes"</u> for the N Y paper, the <u>Critic</u>—they give me $10 a piece for them, &amp; want
      several more—I make use of my notes—at Timber Creek and Glendale and
      every where—I shall use them in a book at a future time—Hank, dear boy,
      I hope you are all right again by the time this reaches you—It is now noon
      &amp; I must get out a bit—I went out &amp; took a
      short stroll, but my knees gave out &amp; I had to turn back—beautiful day
      here—I saw, had 10 minutes talk with the young lady lives next door but one
      above us in Stevens street, (I have spoken to you about) a great friend of mine,
      lived here ever since we have—I think she is the handsomest woman &amp;
      pleasantest ways for young, I ever knew—full figure, blonde, good hair, teeth,
      complexion, 
      ab't
      
       19, a worker too, cooks &amp; scrubs, but when she dresses up, she
      takes the shine off of all—(O that I was young again)—always feel better
      the whole day, when I can see &amp; talk with her
   </p>
   
   <p><u>8½ Evening</u>—after supper, I will finish—Have
      been over in 
      Phila—went out a ways on Market 
      st
      
       cars—nothing to write
      about particular—Shall be down Friday in the 4½ p.m. train, to
      Kirkwood—So long, dear son—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03994_n1">1. Whitman erred in writing
      "Feb: 7." According to his Commonplace Book, Whitman sent Harry a letter on
      March 7 and went to Glendale on Friday, March 11 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
