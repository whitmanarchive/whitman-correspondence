      <br></br>Dear Sir:<sup xmlns=""><a href="#uva.00353_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The package of February magazines, sent on the 16th, arrived safely yesterday. 
      Accept my thanks. I am pleased with the typographical appearance, correctness, &amp;c.
      of my piece.<sup><a href="#uva.00353_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I enclose a piece, "<em>Thou vast Rondure, Swimming in Space</em>," 
      of which I have to say to you as follows. It is to appear in the April number of 
      the <em>London Fortnightly Review</em>.<sup><a href="#uva.00353_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Having just received a note from the editor of that Review, 
      Mr. Morley, in which he intimates that he has no objection to its appearing simultaneously
      in America, 
      I thought I would show it to you. Very possibly, you will not care any how to print
      a piece 
      which is to appear elsewhere. Should that, however, be no objection, and should you
      consider 
      the piece available for your purposes, the price is $20. Of course it would have to
      go in your Number for April. 
      I reserve the right of printing in future book.
      
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00353_n1">1. James T. Fields
      (1817–1881) succeeded James Russell Lowell as editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>. After Emerson, who had received "Proud
      Music of the Sea-Storm" in Walt Whitman's  letter, delivered the poem to Fields, Fields sent $100 to Walt
      Whitman on . He informed Walt
      Whitman on  that if he was to get
      the poem into the February issue it would be impossible to send proof to
      Washington. This was the second of Walt Whitman's poems to appear in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>;  was published on April 5, 1860 and  was published on February 23, 1869.

   <p id="uva.00353_n2">2. "Proud Music of the
      Sea-Storm." Walt Whitman inserted a blurb about the poem in the Washington <em>Star</em> of January 18, 1869; see Emory Holloway, <em>American Mercury</em>, 18 (1929), 483–485.<a href="#r2">[back]

      the <em>London Fortnightly Review</em>, see Whitman's  letter to John Morley. The poem
      did not appear in either magazine. It later was incorporated into <em>Passage to India</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
