   <p>I am just writing this after reading your November Boughs.<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r1">1</a></sup> I want to tell you that I
      was glad of the Book. It comes to me in a time of trouble for me and it is a
      help—I think you will not be sorry to know this. If I were face to face with
      you there are many things in your last poems and writings I should like to talk over
      with you, but it is all too long for a letter and we cannot, save with difficulty,
      <u>talk</u> on paper.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Your sketch of <u>Elias Hicks</u><sup><a href="#n0301" id="r2">2</a></sup> is very
      pleasant to see, as like yourself I am proud of having Friends among my forebears,
      and their early history is a noble one, surely. You record some folks opinion that
      Elias was ambitious, but I don't see it in his
      face nor in the tone of the words you quote, nor in your [illegible]
      impressions and I [illegible] against it. You did a service 
      [
      <span class="unclear">before?</span>]
       in showing people the truth about  
      Old Tom Paine, Blake's friend, and I think many will be thankful for your work on
      Elias Hicks.
   </p>  
   
   
   
   
   <p>I am going to send you a pamphlet which has in it a sketch of William Grimm<sup><a href="#loc.03512_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> by my best friend
      and fellow-worker <u>Gudbrand Vigfusson</u>.<sup><a href="#loc.03512_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> I hope and think you will like it. 
      He that wrote it is I fear [
      <span class="unclear">now?</span>]
      
      seriously ill, but he is patient and cheery as your soldier-lads and he has
      waged a good fight too.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You have many friends here and we do not doubt the success of your <u>sortie</u> you have told the truth and you know there are
      and must be a great-many people that don't like it and don't want to hear it, and
      feel it unpleasant, and 
      [
      <span class="unclear">hate?</span>]
       the light
      because they and their ways are of darkness.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I don't suppose Dante's Commedia was popular with those he judged, but the next
      generation did not sympathize much with them, and I am sure that the next generation
      in
      your new land (where the little silly imitators and make-believers are gonewith their
      lengthy foolish croaking and chattering that 
      [illegible] such folks go)—will
      be listening to your truths.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If I could I would cross the water this summer for I should like to see you in the
      flesh, but that is in the hands of the powers, I do not know how my ways may lie 
      these six months hence.
   </p>  
   
   
   <p>But anyhow you will know that 
      
      your last book has been a help for which I am grateful to you as I am for the
      former ones and their influence.
      I only feel that I do not do you justice as with the performance
      too often lags behind understanding and the spirit is weak too often also.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But I have no right to trouble you with myself or my concerns and I will stop here
      wishing you the best you
      can wish for yourself for this year and those to follow

   <p>There are a number of <u>young</u> men I know that read your

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3999">1. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0301">2. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker from Long
      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his
      influence on Whitman, see David S. Reynolds, <em>Walt Whitman's
         America</em> (New York: Knopf, 1995), 37–39.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.03512_n3">3. Wilhelm Carl Grimm
      (1786–1859) was (with Jakob) one of the Grimm Brothers, who published an
      influential collection of fairy tales in 1812.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03512_n2">4. Gudbrand Vigfusson
      (1827–1889) was born in Iceland and educated at Copenhagen University. He
      became a respected Scandinavian scholar and moved to Oxford. He would later hold
      the position of Reader in Scandinanvian at Oxford until his death.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="n0262">6. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">7. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
