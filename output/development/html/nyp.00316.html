   <p>Well, mother dear, I feel quite well to-day considering—in good spirits, 
      &amp; free from any pain—I suppose you got my letter Saturday last—
      The doctor has been here to-day, first time in three days—
      (so you see he don't think me a very critical case.)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have had real March weather here for two or three days, strong &amp; sudden winds,
      &amp; dust—
      but it is pleasanter to-day—it is now about ½ past 1—I have had my lunch 
      &amp; Mrs. O'Connor has come in for a few moments—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have a little piece in the N. Y. Graphic of Saturday afternoon, March 17<sup><a href="#nyp.00316_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—it is a daily afternoon paper—I write for it, so far—they pay moderately.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I feel to-day as if I was getting well—(but my leg is <em>so clumsy</em> yet—
      &amp; my head has to avoid much talking or being talked to)—I hope this will 
      find you all right, dearest mother—I think about you much—
      
   </p>

   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Mrs. O'Connor wishes me to give her love to you.
