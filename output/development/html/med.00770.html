   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Jeannette Leonard Gilder (1849–1916) helped
      her brother, Richard Watson Gilder, edit <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> and then, with another brother, Joseph Benson Gilder, co-edited
      the <em>Critic</em> (which she co-founded in 1881). For more, see

      University Press, 1978), 2:327. On January 10, 1884, Whitman received slips of
      the article from <em>The Critic</em>; however, there was no word
      whether the copies had been sent to these friends.  he wrote the Gilders to say "If not already mailed, you need <em>not</em> do it—I will attend to it—." Whitman must
      have concluded that the copies were not sent by the Gilders because, on January
      11, he entered a list in his <em>Daybooks and Notebooks</em> of
      people to whom he had sent the article, including those listed above
      (2:326–27).<a href="#r2">[back]
