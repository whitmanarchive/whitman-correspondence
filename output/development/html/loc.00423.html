      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The enclosed $25 is from Joseph P. Davis<sup><a href="#loc.00423_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> making with the $25 sent you last Tuesday $50 from Jo. Now I will give you a statement
      of the whole affair &nbsp;Last Monday I received a letter from W. S. Davis,<sup><a href="#loc.00423_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Jo's brother [at?] Worcester, Mass. saying that he had received a letter from Joe
      directing him to send me $70. $50 to be sent to you and $20 to be expended in buying
      a present for young "Joe Probasco."<sup><a href="#loc.00423_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> The $25 I sent you on Tuesday I borrowed of Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00423_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> so that I might send it immediately and to day I received a check for the $70. I
      have paid Mr Lane the $25 and according to Jo's direction send you the remaind[er]
      of the $50.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jo's brother, W. S. Davis, is a lawer, in Worcester,<sup><a href="#loc.00423_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> with a large number of acquaintances and I think liberal. I wrote him a note acknowledging
      the recipt of the money and telling him that you would write him a long letter,<sup><a href="#loc.00423_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> detailing the manner, style, &amp;c &amp;c of your dispensing the money (like those you used
      to write us) &nbsp;ask him to show it to his friends and get them to give what they can
      and have him send it to you &nbsp;He writes me that he wants you to acknowledge the receipt
      of the money, and also that he would much like to hear from you. I consider it an
      opportunity for you to make this $50 the father of 100's without in the least seeming
      like one asking for it
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I certainly think Mother is following a mistaken notion of ecomony.<sup><a href="#loc.00423_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> I think the only decent meals that any of them have had for three months is what
      they have eaten with Mat and I. As regards Mother I am perfectly willing she should
      live with us all [the time?] (that is to eat, I mean) but Ed and Jess I cant stand
      entirely. Dont understand me that they do eat with us, for they dont as much perhaps as they used to. Mother certainly does not, not as much as we wish
      her to, for we always call her. I notice however that when Jess does eat with us that
      he does not throw up his victuals. And Andrew too, his trouble comes as much from
      his mode of living and sleeping &nbsp;His room for sleeping is without ventilation. the
      window is coverd with posiness tress. He has no nice little things, [or] all nourishment fixed for him to eat, such as I intended
      Mat should fix for him. I dont think myself that we have any thing to do with Nancy, she is able enough to make
      a good living both for herself and the children, if she wasnt so dam'd lazy.
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt I wish you was home for awhile. I think you would see and think as I do. I have
      scribbled this to you just as I have thought for a day or two. Ruggles<sup><a href="#loc.00423_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> says that Andrew cannot be a well man in this town, to be sure even going away may
      not help him, but he thinks and is almost certain that it will. I wish if you dont come on you would write me also write Andrew. Oh you dont know how down spirited he is

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00423_n1">1. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. A lifelong friend of Jeff Whitman's, he became city engineer of
      Boston (1871–80) and completed his distinguished career as chief engineer
      of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (1880–1908). For his work
      with Jeff in St. Louis, see Thomas Jefferson Whitman's letters to Walt Whitman
      from , , and .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00423_n2">2. The lawyer William S.
      Davis and his brother Joseph were descendants of a distinguished Massachusetts
      family (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:152–53).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00423_n3">3. He was probably a young
      son of Samuel R. Probasco, an engineer at the waterworks. See Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman from .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00423_n4">4. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
      and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter of
      , and later various sums which
      Whitman acknowledged in letters from , , , and . In his letter of , Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in the
      Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman wrote,
      obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of money,
      contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly
      through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted Whitman
      in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from , and ). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal welfare that on , he sent through Jeff $5 "for your
      own especial benefit."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00423_n5">5. Someone, probably Walt
      Whitman, set off the first half of this sentence with virgules and underscored
      "W. S. Davis" and "Worcester."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00423_n6">6. Walt Whitman wrote to
      William S. Davis on .<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00423_n7">7. There was much ill will
      in the Whitman household at this time. Jeff thought that his mother's frugality
      was endangering the health of his brothers; the mother felt that Jeff and Mattie
      had themselves been stingy regarding Andrew. On September 15 (?), 1863, Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman complained in a letter to Walt that Andrew and his wife Nancy
      expected her to pay their rent: "i suppose martha has told nancy i have got 2 or
      3 hundred dollars in the bank &nbsp;they never gave him one cents worth when he went
      away not even a shirt....i said to mat the other day in a joke if they had
      another young one they would be so stingey we wouldent know what to doo but i
      got the same old retort that it was me that was stingey with my bank book....i
      told her the other day becaus i had 2 or 3 hu dolla if i used it all i might go
      to the poor house" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book,
      Manuscript, and Special Collections Library).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00423_n8">8. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his
      practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems"
      (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:90, n. 85; 330).<a href="#r8">[back]
