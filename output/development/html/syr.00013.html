      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>This morning I had occasion to call at the house of a Mr. William Brough, who lives
      in
      a costly residence on Farragut Square and is a very pleasant, educated
      man—evidently of wealth. I saw there on the wall of his parlor a fine, large
      cut of yourself in a handsome frame. I found that he admired Drum-Taps very much. I
      mentioned the proposed pension for you, and he said that if you were in need of
      assistance he thought there would be no trouble in raising a purse and that he would
      be glad to take hold of the matter if it was thought advisable. If the pension is
      not authorized I will see him again about the subscription.
   </p>
   
   <p>Eldridge<sup><a href="#loc.00943_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> and O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> have gone to
      California to the
      place where Dr. Channing<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup> resides, and have arrived
      safely. I saw them off two weeks ago. O'Connor, I fear cannot hold out long, but his
      place is kept open for him here. His trouble is induration of the spinal marrow.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been dropped out of the Govt. Service to make room for a Democrat and am
      looking about here for something to do. I am thinking of starting a Bureau of
      General Information. Literary, Scientific and Political, at the Capital of the
      Nation. The only question is whether I can subsist till the Bureau becomes a paying
      institution.
   </p>
   
   <p>I enclose a paragraph I cut out of the Richmond Va. Times. Let me hear from you.
      Wishing you health and happiness and long life I am,
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Joseph B. Marvin, a friend and
      an admirer of Whitman's poetry, was from 1866 to 1867 the co-editor of the <em>Radical</em>. He was then appointed as a clerk in the Treasury
      Department in Washington, on behalf of which he took a trip to London in the
      late fall of 1875. On , Whitman
      wrote a letter to William Michael Rossetti to announce a visit from Marvin.
      Rossetti gave a dinner for Marvin, which was attended by the following "good
      Whitmanites": Anne Gilchrist; Joseph Knight, editor of the London <em>Sunday Times</em>; Justin McCarthy, a novelist and writer for
      the London <em>Daily News</em>; Edmund Gosse; and Rossetti's
      father-in-law, Ford Madox
      Brown.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00943_n2">1. Charles W. Eldridge was
      one half of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge,
      who put out the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In
      December 1862, on his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg,
      Virginia, Walt Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had
      become a clerk in the office of the army paymaster and eventually obtained a
      desk for Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster. For
      more on Whitman's relationship with Thayer and Eldridge see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="loc.00945_n5">3. William F. Channing
      (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
      Whitman stayed at his home in October, 1868.<a href="#r3">[back]
