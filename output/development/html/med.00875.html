   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Donaldson
      (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
      introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
      the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
      carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt
         Whitman, the Man</em> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see

      (1838–1905), born John Henry Brodribb, was a well-known British stage
      actor and inspiration for Bram Stoker's <em>Dracula</em>. Both
      Stoker (1847–1912) and Irving visited Whitman in Camden in 1884, where the actor and
      Whitman talked "a good while and seemed to take to each other mightily" (Thomas
      Donaldson, <em>Walt Whitman the Man</em> [New York: Francis P.
      Harper, 1896], 55).<a href="#r2">[back]
