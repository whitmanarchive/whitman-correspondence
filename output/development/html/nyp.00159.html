   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>In a letter to his mother,
      Whitman describes Thomas B. Neat as "one very good boy, Thos Neat, 2d N Y
      Cavalry, wounded in leg—he is now home on furlough, his folks live I think in
      Jamaica, he is a noble boy, he may call upon you, (I gave him here $1 toward
      buying his crutches &amp;c.)— I like him very much." (See Whitman's letter to
      his mother from .)
