      Oct‑ 7. 1871.
      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>When a man has ventured to dedicate his work to another without authority or
      permission, I think that he is bound to make confession of the liberty he has taken.
      This must be my excuse for sending to you the crude poem in 
      wh.
      
       you may perchance detect some echo, faint &amp; feeble, of your
      Calamus.—As I have put pen to paper I cannot refrain from saying that since the time
      when I first took up Leaves of Grass in a friend's rooms at Trinity College
      Cambridge six  years
      ago till now, your poems have been my constant companions. I have read them in Italy
      by the shores of the Mediterranean, under pine trees or caverns washed by the
      sea—&amp; in Switzerland among the alpine pastures &amp; beside the glaciers. At
      home I have found in them pure air &amp; health—the free breath of the world—when
      often cramped by illness &amp; the cares of life. What one man can do  by communicating to
      those he loves the treasure he has found, I have done among my friends.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I say this in order that I may, as simply as may be, tell you how much I owe to you.
      He who makes the words of a man his spiritual food for years is greatly that man's
      debtor.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As for the poem I send you—it is of course implicit already in your Calamus,
      especially in "Scented herbage of my breast."  I have but set to an old tune the new
      divine song—: for you know that on this side of the Atlantic at least people most
      readily listen to old tunes. I fear greatly I have marred the purity &amp; beauty of
      your thought by my bad singing.—I am an Englishman, married, with 3 children, &amp;
      am aged 30.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Answer to this I scarcely expect, as I certainly do not deserve it. The poem I send
      is due for reasons already set forth. It is a printer's proof at present &amp; no
      more.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Addington Symonds, a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was in his
      time most famous as the author of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>. But in the smaller circles of the emerging
      upper-class English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of
      homoerotic poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual
      inversion as it was then known (<em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 701).
