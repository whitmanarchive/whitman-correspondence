   </p>
   
   <p>I just received a letter from an Uncle of mine that is in Campbell Hospital and enclosed
      I found an Envelope with your address so I thought I would write a few lines to you
      I shall expect an answer from this I shall look with all the eyes I have got for the
      answer until I receive although I may look for the next year &amp; a half as I have done
      and then not get any answer  I would give a considerable to see you about two hours
   </p>
   
   <p>There is a friend of mine just gone to Washington he has got an appointment as clerk
      in the Treasury he is about 20 years of age he got a member of Congress to work for
      him. You dont think I can get a place as clerk then in the Patent office in Treasury or Paymasters
      do you
   </p>
   
   <p>This young man that I wrote to you about was offered a clerkship in The Paymasters
      department but he could get a larger salery in the Treasury Department
   </p>
   
   <p>What has become of Mr OConnor's People are they still in washington if they are give them my love Please send me your Photograph if you will I shall
      be very much obliged  If this letter gets to you and I receive an ans I will send
      you my Photograph the next time I write. Please send me Mr &amp; Mrs. OConnor's Photograph if they will let you have them to send one.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am having first rate times here in Byron I have to work pretty hard but I dont care anything about that I am in a Dry Goods store at present there isnt any clerk but one but we expect to have more soon I have those books that you gave
      me yet I am a going to keep them until I see you again.
   </p>
   
   <p>There has been about a Dozen customers in since I commenced writing and I dont only barely get to writing and I have to get up so you must excuse this and I will
      try and do better next time. Yours Truly
