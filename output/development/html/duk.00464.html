   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00464_n7">1. This letter dates to the
      year 1865, the year in the hand of Richard Maurice Bucke. Clarence Gohdes and
      Rollo G. Silver agreed with Bucke's date (<em>Faint Clews &amp;
         Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North
      Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 192), and Edwin Haviland Miller cited
      Gohdes and Silver's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:377). Based both on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's anxiety about not having
      received a letter since Walt's departure (November 7?) to Washington and on her
      reference to multiple copies of <em>Drum-Taps</em>, the letter
      dates November 14, 1865.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00464_n5">2. Walt Whitman in an  letter to Andrew Kerr, a clerk in
      the Attorney General's office, stated his intent to "vote here [Brooklyn] early
      Tuesday forenoon &amp; then start immediately for Washington." But he also
      offered to return to Washington earlier if requested. Even if Walt left as
      planned on Tuesday, November 7, election day, and no earlier, he was unusually
      late in writing after his return to Washington. Though no Whitman letters from
      late December or January 1865 are extant, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman acknowledged
      a letter from Walt in her 
      letter.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">3. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00464_n3">4. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      during the summer had told Walt Whitman that she had received "5 books," copies
      of <em>Drum-Taps</em>, from printer Peter Eckler (see her  letter to Walt). Those five books are
      presumably the "first ones" that she mentions in this letter. Walt had inquired
      "whether you got the package of 5 Drum-Taps" about a week before her June letter
      (see his  letter to Louisa). <em>Drum-Taps</em>, a series of poems about Walt Whitman's Civil
      War experience, was published in 1865. It was later integrated into the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and later editions. See <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_83.html">"Drum-Taps (1865)</a>." For details on the printing history and
      organization of <em>Drum-Taps</em>, see Ted Genoways, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00297.pdf">The
         Disorder of <em>Drum-Taps</em></a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 24 (Fall 2006/Winter 2007),
      98–116.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00464_n6">5. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      presumably intended the word "w[rite?]" but omitted all letters after the "w"
      because she had reached the margin of the page. The word is a request for Walt
      to write. The editors Gohdes and Silver transcribed the word as "see [?]" (<em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman
         and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949],
      92).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00464_n4">6. A large number of newspapers
      were published under the title "New Yorker." The <em>New
         Yorker</em> to which the letter refers is not obvious. Possible
      English-language titles published in 1865 include the <em>Central
         New Yorker</em> of Syracuse, New York; the <em>Western New
         Yorker</em> of Perry, New York; <em>Moore's Rural New
         Yorker</em> of Rochester, New York; or the <em>Carthage
         Republican and Northern New Yorker</em> of Carthage, New York.<a href="#r6">[back]
