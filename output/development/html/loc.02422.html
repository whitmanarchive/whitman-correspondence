      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman, Esq.,
      <br></br>My dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> We are making preparations for a notable series of papers on the Battles of the War
      to be written by participants—general
      officers—including Grant,<sup><a href="#n0761" id="r1">1</a></sup> McClellan,<sup><a href="#loc.02422_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Rosecrans,<sup><a href="#nyp.00140_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Beauregard,<sup><a href="#loc.02422_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> Longstreet<sup><a href="#loc.02422_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp;
      Joe Johnson<sup><a href="#loc.02422_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; others. These we desire to supplement
      by short pithy papers on different phases of the war. At Mr. Gilder's<sup><a href="#n0871" id="r7">7</a></sup> request I write to ask if you would not
      write us a short, comprehensive paper on Hospital Nursing in Washington and on the
      field—something human and vivid. We should like about 4000 words.<sup><a href="#loc.02422_n6" id="r8">8</a></sup></p> 
   
   <p> The object of the supplementary 
      
       papers is to give the life, the spirit, the color of the war,
      which may be left out by the generals. 
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours sincerely,
      <br></br>R. U. Johnson
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> N.B. Of course we should like the paper to cover different ground from what you
      have before written if possible—at least to cover it in a different way.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Robert Underwood Johnson

         Magazine</em> from 1873 to 1913 and was the U.S. ambassador to Italy in 1920

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0761">1. Ulysses Simpson Grant
      (1822–1885) was the highest ranking Union general of the Civil War. As
      commander of the Army of the Potomac, he accepted the surrender of Robert E. Lee
      at Appomattox. After the war, Grant served two terms as president, elected in
      1868 and again in 1872.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02422_n2">2. General George Brinton
      McClellan (1826–1885) was General-in-Chief of the Army of the United
      States from November 1861 until July 1862, when he was replaced by General Henry
      W. Halleck. In 1864, when McClellan ran for the presidency, the Democratic party
      split between war Democrats and peace Democrats.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00140_n3">3. William Starke Rosecrans
      (1819–1898) was a general in the Union Army during the Civil War. Though
      he was successful in several early campaigns during the war, he is most known
      for his disastrous defeat at the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02422_n3">4. Pierre Gustave
      Toutant-Beauregard (1818–1893) was a prominent general of the Confederacy
      during the Civil War. By defending Petersburg, Virginia, from Union Troops in
      1864 he effectively saved the Confederate capital of Richmond from being
      captured. After the war, Beauregard became a railroad executive.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02422_n4">5. James Longstreet
      (1821–1904), nicknamed "Old War Horse," was a Confederate general and was
      involved in the Southern victories at Second Bull Run, Fredericksburg, and
      Chickamauga. After the war, Longstreet joined the Republican Party and held a
      number of civil and diplomatic positions.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02422_n5">6. Joseph E. Johnston
      (1807–1891) was a Confederate general and the senior commanding officer of
      P. G. T. Beauregard. Johnston was a key figure in the defense of Richmond
      against Union troops. Like Beauregard, Johnston entered the railroad business
      after the war.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0871">7. Richard Watson Gilder
      (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <em>The Century</em>, from 1881 until his death. Whitman had met
      Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1955], 482). Whitman attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
      Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the <em>New York Tribune</em>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder
      one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
      delirium" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">Sunday, August 5, 1888</a>). For more about Gilder, see Susan L.
      Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_95.html">Gilder, Richard Watson (1844–1909)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="loc.02422_n6">8. "Army Hospitals and Cases"
      was printed in the magazine in October 1888. See also the letter from Whitman to
