      <br></br><br></br>Dear son,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will begin a letter for you to-day, &amp; probably finish it to-morrow, &amp; send it
      off, so that you will have it by or before Sunday. The heat is again upon us here,
      days—but the nights are pleasant. It is now Thursday afternoon, between 3 and
      4—&amp; I am writing this in my room in Portland av. Pete, one month of my leave
      exactly is up to-day. I have been out quite a while to-day, over to New York, to the
      printing office, &amp; seeing to one thing &amp; another. It was sweaty work. On my way
      back, I went up in the pilot house &amp; sailed across the river three times—a fine
      breeze blowing. Then home—took a bath—ate my dinner—&amp; here I am all
      alone, most stript, taking things as cool as possible, &amp; writing this letter.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, your letter of 23d came yesterday, &amp; the one written partly that night &amp;
      partly 24th came this forenoon. Those are the only letters I have received since the
      one of
      13th telling me the orders were for you to go to work next day, (Sunday.) I have been
      uneasy
      ever since to hear. The letter rec'd this morning gives me the first definite information
      how things have turned out. Dear son, I want you to try to cast aside all irritating
      thoughts &amp; recollections, &amp; preserve a cheerful mind. That is the main part of
      getting along through the toil &amp; battle of life—&amp; it is a good deal habit.<sup><a href="#loc.01527_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was away a good part of last week, down the bay—went away each time early in the
      morning, &amp; got home after dark. I am having quite jovial times. I went to Wallack's<sup><a href="#n0676" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      theatre one night lately with a friend who wanted to see a piece called "Fritz"<sup><a href="#loc.01527_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—a miserable, sickish piece. I was glad enough to get out in
      the open air away from such humbug. I am still feeling gay &amp; hearty. I work several
      hours a day keeping things straight among the printers &amp; founders, on my books. They
      are
      being cast in electrotype plates. I will tell you more about it when we meet. Well,
      Pete, I
      guess this will do for to-day. I think of sallying forth, soon as the sun gets pretty
      well
      down, &amp; crossing to New York to loafe around two or three hours. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Friday afternoon August 26. </p>
   
   
   <p>Well I went over to New York last evening—up town to see some friends—come home
      about 11—just in time to escape a thunder shower. It is splendid to-day—I have
      been over all day working, quite busy—&amp; have just got home &amp; had my
      dinner—it is now about 4—It is quite pleasant riding here in Brooklyn—we
      have large open cars—in good weather it is real lively—I quite enjoy
      it—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, give my respects to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nash, &amp; to your cousin—also to Jenny
      Murphy<sup><a href="#loc.01527_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—not forgetting the boys on the road—also
      Wash Milburn<sup><a href="#loc.01527_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup>—God bless you, &amp; good bye for this time,
      my own dear loving boy.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01527_n1">1. Walt Whitman was disturbed by Doyle's mood
      swings; he raised similar concerns in his  letter to Doyle.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0676">2. Here Walt Whitman refers to the second Wallack's
      Theatre on Broadway. The first Wallack's theater at Broadway and Broome Street
      was managed by James W. Wallack from 1852 to 1861. He built the second Wallack's
      Theatre in 1861, which prospered under his and then his nephew Lester Wallack's
      management until 1882, when yet another Wallack's Theatre was opened.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01527_n2">3. J. K. Emmet appeared in Charles Gayler's
      <em>Fritz, Our German Cousin</em> at Wallack's Theatre from
      July 11 to September 10, 1870; see George Clinton Densmore Odell, <em>Annals of the New York Stage</em> (New York: Columbia
      University Press, 1927–1949), 8:564–565.<a href="#r3">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01527_n4">5. W. C. Milburn, either the son or the
      brother of Dr. J. P. Milburn, a druggist mentioned in Whitman's  letter to Doyle.<a href="#r5">[back]
