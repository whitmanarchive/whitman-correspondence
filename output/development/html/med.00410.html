   <p>Mr. Cyril Flower wrote to me some time ago to inform me that he had brought your
      books with him from America, a gift from you, and that they were lying in my London
      chambers; Whereupon I wrote back to him, begging him to bring them himself to me at
      my country house, and I have been accordingly, always expecting to see him, but he
      never came, being detained by law business in town. I have now just called at my
      London lodgings, and found them on the table. I had previously met with several of
      your works and read them with interest and had made up my mind that you had a large
      and lovable nature. I discovered great "go" in your writings and am not surprised
      at
      the hold they have taken on your fellow country men.<sup><a href="#med.00410_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Wishing you all success and prosperity, and with all thanks for your kind gift which
      I should have acknowledged earlier, had I received it sooner, I remain
   </p>

      Ever yours, very truly,
      <br></br>A Tennyson
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I trust that if you visit England, you will grant me the pleasure of receiving
      and entertaining you under my own roof.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809â€“1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00410_n1">1. This was Tennyson's first
      letter to Walt Whitman. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871, or late 1870,
      probably shortly after the visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the
      letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson, <em>Walt Whitman the
         Man</em> 1896, 223; for Flower, see Whitman's letter of ). According to Walt Whitman's
      reply on , Tennyson wrote a second
      letter on September 22, 1871, also apparently lost.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="med.00410_n2">2. Sylvester Baxter reported
      that in April, 1881, Walt Whitman had informed Trowbridge and himself of his
      discouragement about his "poetic mission" at the time Tennyson's letter arrived.
