   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00463_n1">1. The day of the month, "27,"
      is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the
      letter to the month September and the year 1865, and Edwin Haviland Miller cited
      Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:377). "27" is somewhat obscured by
      the postscript, but the number is certain because Louisa also wrote to Walt that
      she "received your letter yesterday all right the 26th." The letter concerns
      Burlington, Vermont, and Louisa arrived for her only extended visit to daughter
      Hannah Heyde on September 5, 1865. She returned in mid-October of that year.
      Therefore, September 27, 1865 is certain as the date of this letter.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00463_n2">2. Walt Whitman's September 26,
      1865 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:369).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00463_n8">3. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., resided in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles L.
      Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among
      the Whitmans for his offensive letters and treatment of Hannah. Louisa in her
       letter to Walt Whitman had
      labeled Heyde a "little conceited fool." According to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman's  letter to Walt, Louisa
      visited Hannah in September 1865 because of a quarrel about "some women that
      Heyde had in his room." According to that letter, Louisa informed Jeff that she
      intended to "bring Han home."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00463_n17">4. The intended word is
      "very," but Louisa Van Velsor Whitman added an unneeded descender so that the
      first letter resembles a "p." <a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">5. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">7. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n7">8. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. Eddy remained in Brooklyn during Louisa's visit to
      Burlington under the care of Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Jeff's wife, with
      whom Louisa and Eddy lived in the Portland Avenue home. George and his wife
      Louisa Orr Haslam cared for Eddy after Louisa's death, with financial support
      from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">9. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00463_n7">10. When George Washington
      Whitman returned to Brooklyn after the Civil War, he rented a room from a Mrs.
      Hegeman (also see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). Elizabeth Hegeman (1795?–1868) is
      listed in the <em>Brooklyn Directory</em> (1868) as a resident of
      "83 Car[ro]ll" Street, some three miles east of the Portland Avenue home where
      Louisa lived.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00463_n10">11. Walt Whitman eventually
      traveled to Brooklyn and from there to Burlington, Vermont, to visit Hannah and
      assist his mother's return on October 17. He wrote from Brooklyn to Ellen M.
      O'Connor on  that he would
      "probably go for her very shortly" and on  (also to Ellen M. O'Connor) that "mother arrived home last
      Tuesday."<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00463_n12">12. Mr. Wells and family in
      Burlington, Vermont, have not been identified.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00463_n13">13. Keesville, New York, is
      located on the St. Lawrence River opposite from Burlington, Vermont, inland from
      Port Kent (mentioned below).<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00463_n14">14. Port Kent, New York, is
      located on the opposite side of the St. Lawrence River from Burlington, Vermont.
      An 1861 travel guide described the view from Port Kent as "exceeding striking
      and beautiful" (Addison T. Richards, <em>Appletons' Illustrated
         Hand-book of American Travel</em> [New York: Appleton, 1861], 155).<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00463_n16">15. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      probably refers to the route run by the R. W. Sherman, a steamboat lauded as the
      "fastest steamboat on the lake." Launched in 1851, it was piloted by Captain T.
      D. Chapman. See Walter Hill Crockett, <em>A History of Lake
         Champlain: The Record of Three Centuries, 1609–1909</em> (Burlington:
      H. J. Shanley &amp; Co., 1909), 308–309.<a href="#r15">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00463_n19">16. The letter "s" is unclear.
      The letter "s" is probably written over the letter "l" in the canceled start of
      the word "lake."<a href="#r16">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00463_n15">17. In 1853 Burlington
      constructed a large building to house mechanic shops (for skilled laborers) that
      was called the Pioneer Mechanics' Shop. A "capacious building four hundred feet
      long, fifty feet wide, and four stories high," the shop "accommodated a great
      number of mechanics." The original structure was destroyed by fire in 1858 but
      rebuilt on a smaller scale (see Austin Jacobs Coolidge and John Brainard
      Mansfield,<em>History and Description of New England</em>
      [Burlington: A. J. Coolidge, 1860], 776).<a href="#r17">[back]
