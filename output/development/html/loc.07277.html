   <p>Your postcard of 4 this moment to hand. I shall be very anxious untill I hear further
      from you as to the result of the consultation. I
      understand of course about the enlargement of the prostate, that is a troublesome
      complaint but not a fatal matter, as for the "diabetes" I do not understand
      that—think <u>that</u> must be a mistake, I know there is
      some kidney trouble—some albuminuria—&amp;c. however no doubt I shall
      soon be informed as to the whole matter and I trust you will write me
      yourself—I hope however that when I come East next month I shall find you
      something better than at present and that we shall be able to talk it all over. I
      am
      greatly pleased that you
      had a better night and trust that is the beginning of some better times for you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hear nothing from Wm Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r2">2</a></sup>—they
      seem slow about the patents but I have no doubt we shall come out right side up
      eventually.

   <p>We are all well here</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4284">2. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
