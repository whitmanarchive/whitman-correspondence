      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>My very dear friend—It is good to feel so assured of one's love as not to need to
      express it, &amp; it is very good to know that one's love is never doubted or
      questioned, &amp; for these reasons it is I am sure that we do not write to each
      other. I always know that you know that I love you all the time, even though we
      should never meet again, my feeling could  never change, and I am <u>sure</u> that you know it as well as I do. I do flatter myself
      too, that <u>you</u> care for <u>me</u>,—not
      as I love you, because you are great and strong, and more sufficient unto yourself
      than any woman can be, besides you have the great outflow of your pen which saves
      you from the need of personal love as one feels it who has no such resource. You
      could not afford to love other than as the Gods love; that is to love <u>every body</u>, but  no one enough to be made unhappy, or to
      lose your balance. You know that Hector Tyndale<sup><a href="#duk.00382_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> was
      always preaching that to us, to be like the Gods. But however it is with you—it is
      very good sometimes for me to try to tell those that are very dear to me how I like
      them. And ever since I left home I have had it in my heart to write you,—but it has
      been postponed, waiting for the more fitting time. It is only when I am away from
      you that I am 
      
      conscious
       of how deeply you have influenced my life, my thoughts, my feelings, my
      views—<u>my self</u> in fact, in every way, you seem to have
      permeated my whole being. And knowing you as intimately as I do I find myself
      constantly wondering and thinking how such or such a thing seems to you, what your
      ideas are in relation to this or that.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I find too, that the estimate in which persons hold you is a sort of test of them
      to
      me all the time. My 
      friend Mrs. Mitchell with whom I was at Nantucket said to me one day, "I see plainly
      that if I am to remain in your good graces, I am to come to the knowledge and love
      of your friend Walt Whitman," she said that she could see that I made it a test in
      some sort. Every where, as usual, I find some who ask me about you, &amp; who want
      to hear of you. I have enjoyed very much reading the "Passage to India." The other
      I
      lent as soon as it came and it has  not yet been returned. Thank you for both. I shall have to scold
      you for some portion of the arrangement—but that I will reserve till I see you. I
      always feel refreshed and stronger for reading your poems, they seem so sane, so
      sweet, so human and healthy. But more than all your poems, more than all you ever
      can write, <u>you</u> are to me; yet they were very much to me
      before I knew you. It is good to have my love for you then rounded by knowing you,
      and  finding my feeling
      and thought about you justified. I have sometimes suffered very deeply, but I feel
      that I have been dealt very kindly by, and had more than fullest compensation in the
      great privilege of knowing you, and being permitted to be with you as I have. I hope
      that the good angels who take care of us will for long, long yet spare us to each
      other. And you must be very good and come often to see us.  You must not neglect the golden
      opportunity of letting me love you and see you all that is possible. I think that
      I
      must have been very good at some time to have deserved such a blessing.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Very soon I hope to see you now, very soon. Till then good by. Jeannie<sup><a href="#loc.01257_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> sends much love to you, so does my sister Jeannie. My
      Jeannie has grown to be a tall girl, &amp; is very graceful sometimes in her manner,
      as you used often to tell me  that she would be. She is quite womanly about some things. She
      longs to be at home; though she enjoys her cousins.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I, too, quite long to be with you all. Soon I shall be (D.V.).</p>

      Good

      ,
      <br></br>With love ever—
      <br></br>Your affectionate
      <br></br>Nelly.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I came near forgetting to send you a letter which I cut from a Boston paper on
      purpose to send you. It is the account of the death  of those persons who were overtaken
      by the snow storm in the mountains. The diary is to me very touching, the simple
      manly, unflinching tone of what that dying man wrote is to me very noble, I
      can't read it once without the tears blinding my eyes. It is such a scene, he
      alone in that mountain pass with no hope of escape and the snow falling in
      fearful quantities. It is one of the <u>loneliest</u>
      pictures that I ever conceived. As I read it I thought of you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good by again.</p>
   
   <p>With love Nelly.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor
      (1830–1910) was the wife of William D. O'Connor. Nelly O'Connor, whose
      marital strife with William had led to a separation in 1870 and resulted in
      divorce, wrote an admiring letter to Walt Whitman from Providence, Rhode Island,
      shortly before this visit to Brooklyn (see Nelly's  letter to Walt; and see Florence B. Freedman, <em>William Douglas O'Connor: Walt Whitman's Chosen Knight</em>
      [Athens: Ohio University Press, 1985], 246). For a time Walt Whitman lived with
      the O'Connors, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to be
      his close associates during the early Washington years. The correspondence
      between Walt Whitman and Nelly is almost as voluminous as the poet's
      correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00382_n2">1. Hector Tyndale was an
      importer of china in Philadelphia. Walt Whitman described a meeting with him on
      February 25, 1857 (The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman (1902), 10 vols., IX,
      154-155). His mother, Sarah Tyndale was an abolitionist from Philadelphia who
      met Walt Whitman in the company of Bronson Alcott and Henry Thoreau. See
      Whitman's letter to Sarah Tyndale of June 20, 1857 in Edwin Haviland Miller,
      ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77), 1:42–44; Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The
