      <br></br><br></br>Dear son<sup xmlns=""><a href="#nyp.00407_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I supposed you rec'd a paper from me lately with an acc't of some of my movements
      &amp;c. here, as I sent you one—I had no idea of staying so long when I left 13th June—thought
      only of staying a couple of days—[but then?] it will be most a month soon—But I shall
      return to Camden next Tuesday—or Wednesday at furthest—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I keep well &amp; hearty considering—it has been very hot weather here for a week, but
      I havn't minded it any to hurt—to-day it has been a little more moderate—I have been
      down this forenoon to Sarony's,<sup><a href="#nyp.00407_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> the great photographic establishment, where I was invited to come &amp; sit for my picture—had
      a real pleasant time—I will bring you on one of the pictures—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My darling boy, I want to see you very much, &amp; I know you do me too—Harry, I meet
      many, many friends here, some very fine folks—some tip-top young men too—&amp; there is
      no end to hospitality, &amp; places to visit &amp;c.—everybody seems to know me—it is quite
      funny sometimes—but I believe I am as contented down by the old pond as any where—(I
      wish I was there this afternoon—at least for a couple of hours)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, I see Hunter<sup><a href="#nyp.00407_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> was convicted—we will see now whether he is hung—I see an item in the paper that
      [Emma?] Bethel had confessed to poisoning the Bishops—I will finish my letter &amp; send
      it off to-morrow—
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>Sunday July 7</em>—The little 15 months old baby, little Harry (that was born that night there in 10th
      street,) is a fine, good bright child, not very rugged, but gets along very well—I
      take him in my arms always after breakfast &amp; go out in front for a short walk—he is
      very contented &amp; good with me—little Kitty<sup><a href="#nyp.00407_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> goes too—I had a good night's rest last night, &amp; am feeling comfortable to-day—Good
      bye for the present, my loving son—It will not be long now before we are together
      again—
   </p>

   <p id="nyp.00407_n1">1. The letters from Harry
      Stafford to Walt Whitman in 1878 reveal the troubled relations between the two
      men (See Edwin Haviland Miller, "Introduction," <em>Walt Whitman:
         The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 3:1–9).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00407_n2">2. On September 18, Whitman
      received 250 prints of this photograph (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
