      <br></br>England:
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">2nd July 1888.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>This letter is to give you love and greeting from an English Socialist and his wife.
      We heard a little while ago that you were seriously ill, but hope you are now much
      better.
   </p>
   
   <p>Forgive all that is amiss in the enclosed papers, and look on them as the first
      efforts of a child to speak words he can already understand. What we want to tell
      you is, that here in old England, in the midst of infidelity and sentimental
      pessimism, your strong and beautiful thought has found its way  into the hearts and lives of two
      lovers, making them wiser and happier in every way. We are no longer ashamed of
      ourselves, but accept life as we find it. Acknowledging ourselves your disciples,
      we
      take you at your word as you have given it to us in your books, and believe that you
      will welcome us into your personal confidence and love. We should like to know that
      you feel this and accept it, and should infinitely treasure even a single line from
      your hand in return; but if you are ill, or feel it anyhow a burden, do not trouble
      about it, for we shall not fear you have forgotten us.
   </p>
   
   <p>It would be futile to try and thank you for what you have taught us; we  know that our
      thanks would best please you if shown in trying to help others in the same way. This
      we do, and promise still to do; so wherever you are you will know that here your
      spirit is at work. We have a brother in the States, and long to visit them
      ourselves: can it be that we shall ever have the joy of meeting you face to
      face?
   </p>
   
   <p>With our truest love and thanks, and prayers for your joy and health</p>
   
   <p>We are, dear Walt Whitman,</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Reginald A Beckett and his
      wife Katie E. Beckett were British socialists and admirers of Whitman. Reginald
      Beckett, also a poet and journalist, authored "Whitman as a Socialist Poet,"
      which was published in the July 1888 issue of <em>To-Day</em>
      magazine. He also published in serials such as the <em>Christian
         Socialist</em> and the <em>Labor Prophet</em>, a periodical
      that he began editing in 1896 (Kirsten Harris, <em>Walt Whitman
         and British Socialism: 'The Love of Comrades'</em> [New York: Routledge,
      2016], 20, 109). Little additional information is known about Katie E.
      Beckett.
