      <br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have rec'd your letter of the 12th. I agree to allow you better than half off, 
      namely you to acc't to me at $1.40 cts a copy on the bound <em>Leaves of Grass</em> 
      (which retails at $3)—and at 30 cts each for <em>As a strong bird</em>, (which retails at 75 cts.)<sup><a href="#loc.01716_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will be very happy to see you, at any time. I am stopping at 322 Stevens st. Camden,
      
      (cross by Phil. ferry from foot of Market st.—or Camden depot from N. Y.)<sup><a href="#loc.01716_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If you are willing to go into selling my books, I think you ought to have some of
      the little 
      30 cts brochure "<em>After All not to Create Only</em>" published by Roberts Bros. Boston.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I do not of course expect the sale could any how be a rushing one—but<sup><a href="#loc.01716_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>

      Whitman's relations with his book agents were complicated and troubling
      during these years. O'Kane, a New York book dealer, took over the books
      still in the possession of Michael Doolady (a bookseller to whom Whitman
      wrote on ) on April 22, 1874.
      On December 29, 1873, Whitman withdrew his books from O'Kane, and also
      dismissed Piper, the Boston outlet. At the same time he entrusted the whole
      matter to Asa K. Butts and Co., which went into bankruptcy in the following
      year. Though Whitman wrote cordially to O'Kane on , he later became hostile. Citing only the
      initials, Richard Maurice Bucke, <em>Walt Whitman</em>
      (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), in his "official" biography (46), averred
      that O'Kane and Somerby, Butts's successor, "took advantage of [Walt
      Whitman's] helplessness to embezzle the amounts due—(they calculated
      that death would soon settle the score and rub it out.)" This sounds like an
      interpolation composed by the poet himself; note also Whitman's  letter to Jeannette Gilder,
      in which he wrote, "every one of the three successive book agents I have had
      in N. Y. has embezzled the proceeds." In an address book now held in the
      Library of Congress, Walt Whitman scrawled on a piece of O'Kane's
      stationery, "rascal."<br><br>

      for reaching Camden were repeatedly corrected, the reading at this point is
      somewhat conjectural.<a href="#r4">[back]
