      <br></br><br></br>Dear Cyril Flower,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>You may think yourself neglected—perhaps forgotten—by your American
      friend. But not forgotten, believe me. Twenty times during the last year have I
      promised myself to write you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am still here at Washington—every thing much the same in my condition as when
      you made your brief visit here.—
   </p>
   
   <p>I continue well in health &amp; good spirits—&amp; as usual spend much more of
      my leisure in the open air, than reading, studying, or in-doors at all.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am very soon going on to New York to bring out a new edition of my poems—same
      as the copy you have, only in one Vol.—shall remain there until about 7th of April—(my address there will be, <u>107 north Portland av. Brooklyn, New York, U.S.
         America</u>)—Then to return again here (where my address will be <u>Solicitor's Office Treasury, Washington, D.C.</u> &amp;c.)
   </p>
   
   <p>Your two letters from England duly reached me at the times, &amp; were very welcome.</p>
   
   <p>Tennyson has twice written to me—&amp; good friendly letters. He invites me to visit him.</p>
   
   
   <p>I shall mail to you in a few days my latest piece,<sup><a href="#loc.01694_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> in a magazine.
   </p>
   
   <p>And now dear Cyril Flower I send you my love—&amp; hope you may not think hard of me for
      not writing before.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Cyril Flower (1843–1907) was an English
      barrister and a friend of Tennyson; see Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt
         Whitman in England</em> (1934), 128–129. According to the February 20,
      1886 <em>Solicitor's Journal</em>, Flower was appointed a Lord of
      the Treasury; Flower served as a member of Parliament from 1880 to 1892, when he
      was given the title Baron Battersea (see the London <em>Gazette</em> (6 September 1892), 5090). According to Flower's  letter, he met Whitman in Washington
      in December, 1870. He had later delivered some of Whitman's books to Tennyson,
      who "was much touched by your memory of him, and I told him of your deep regard
      for him." On , Flower informed
      Whitman that Tennyson was sending a letter by the same mail (Tennyson's letter
      was dated ). Flower wrote again on
      : "When I read you or think of
      you . . . I feel that I hold in my hand clasped strong &amp; tight &amp; for
      security the great hand of a friend, a simple good fellow, a man who loves me
      &amp; who is beautiful because he loves, &amp; with the consciousness of that I
      feel never alone—never sad."
