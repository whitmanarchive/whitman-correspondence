      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Wouldn't these articles be available for the paper. The price is $60. for the two.
      Of course they are 
      hitherto unpublished—(my book in which they go, will not be out for at least three
      or four weeks.)<sup><a href="#uva.00371_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
