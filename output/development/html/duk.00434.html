   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00434_n11">1. This letter dates to
      March 7, 1865. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter March 7, and
      Richard Maurice Bucke later supplied the year 1865. Edwin Haviland Miller,
      however, dated the letter to 1863 (<em>The Correspondence,
         1842–67</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:372). If not an error in his calendar of letters, Miller may have dated
      Louisa's letter to 1863 because an article by Walt appeared in the <em>New York Times</em> and because Walt asked Louisa to
      retrieve copies of the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> that
      year. An article by Whitman appeared in both publications in March 1863:
      "," <em>New York
         Times</em>, March 15, 1863, and "," <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Eagle</em>, March 19, 1863. However, Louisa specifically states that the
      article appeared in the "times yesterday" and dates her letter "March 7."
      1865 is correct year because an article by Walt Whitman appeared in the <em>New York Times</em> the previous day (<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/journalism/tei/per.00203.html">"The Soldiers,"</a>
      <em>New York Times</em>, March 6, 1865). Additional
      corroboration is provided by a remark about a sketch made by Samuel H. Sims
      (see Walt Whitman's  letter to
      David F. Wright).<br><br>
      The reason that Walt requested copies of the <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Eagle</em> in March 1865 is not known.

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00434_n1">2. Jessie Louisa Whitman
      (1863–1957) was the younger daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman
      and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and sister-in-law.
      Jessie and her sister Manahatta "Hattie" were both favorites of their uncle
      Walt. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had informed Walt Whitman on  that "sis is not well yet she seems
      to have A kind of fever." The nickname "Sis" was given first to Manahatta but
      was passed to her younger sister Jessie Louisa when Manahatta became "Hattie."
      The letter dates to 1865, so "Sis" is Jessie Louisa.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00434_n9">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      wrote "are is the same department" but presumably intended "are in the same
      department."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00434_n8">4. See Walt Whitman's <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/journalism/tei/per.00203.html">"The Soldiers."</a><a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00434_n7">5. The "eagles" refers probably
      to multiple copies of the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>. No
      article by Walt Whitman in the <em>Eagle</em> from late February
      or early March 1865 is currently known, but his most recent article in that
      newspaper was "A Brooklyn Soldier and a Noble One" (<em>Brooklyn
         Daily Eagle</em>, January 19, 1865). Walt may have requested that his mother
      acquire multiple copies of the article, but no record of his request or her
      response from early 1865 is extant. The article also appeared on the same date
      in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Union</em>. See Jerome M. Loving, "'A
      Brooklyn Soldier, and a Noble One': A <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Union</em> Article by Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly
         Review</em> 20 (March 1974), 27–30.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00434_n2">6. Samuel M. Pooley was a
      member of the Fifty-first New York Volunteers. His experience as a prisoner of
      war with George Washington Whitman is described in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
       letter to Walt Whitman. Walt in
      his notes on the Fifty-first regiment wrote that Pooley was "born in Cornwall,
      Eng. 1836—struck out &amp; came to America when 14—has lived mostly
      in Buffalo[,] learnt ship joining—left Buffalo in the military service
      U.S. June, 1861—came out as private—was made 2d Lieut at South
      Mountain. Made Captain Aug. 1864—got a family in Buffalo" (Manuscripts of
      Walt Whitman in the Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and
      Manuscript Library, Yale University).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">7. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00434_n4">8. Samuel H. Sims, a captain in
      George Washington Whitman's Fifty-first New York Volunteers, had been the
      subject in part of Walt Whitman's "Our Brooklyn Boys in the War" (<em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, January 5, 1863). Sims died on July
      30, 1864 of wounds received near Petersburg, Virginia (see George's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman). Walt may have lived in Sims's tent during part of his stay at
      Falmouth, Virginia, opposite Fredericksburg—a trip that Walt took in
      search of George after reading his brother's name in the <em>New
         York Herald</em> among the list of wounded in the Battle of Fredericksburg.
      As it turned out, George only suffered a minor injury: "I have come out safe and
      sound, although I had the side of my jaw slightly scraped with a peice of shell
      which burst at my feet" (see George's  letter to Louisa).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00434_n5">9. This "Wright" is presumably
      David F. Wright. Walt Whitman asked Wright to send Samuel H. Sims's sketch to
      his brother George Washington Whitman (see Walt's  letter to Wright). Also see "Major Wright" (John Gibson
      Wright) below.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00434_n10">10. Major John Gibson Wright,
      the brother of David F. Wright, was taken prisoner with George Washington
      Whitman at Petersburg, Virginia. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote in her letter to Walt Whitman
      that Major Wright had been placed "in the insane assilum very bad."<a href="#r10">[back]
