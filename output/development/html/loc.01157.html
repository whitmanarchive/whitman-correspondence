   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see

   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.00945_n5">3. William F. Channing
      (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
      Whitman stayed at his home in October, 1868.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0210">4. Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

   <p id="n0830">5. Joseph B. Marvin, a friend and
      an admirer of Whitman's poetry, was from 1866 to 1867 the co-editor of the <em>Radical</em>. He was then appointed as a clerk in the Treasury
      Department in Washington, on behalf of which he took a trip to London in the
      late fall of 1875. On , Whitman
      wrote a letter to William Michael Rossetti to announce a visit from Marvin.
      Rossetti gave a dinner for Marvin, which was attended by the following "good
      Whitmanites": Anne Gilchrist; Joseph Knight, editor of the London <em>Sunday Times</em>; Justin McCarthy, a novelist and writer for
      the London <em>Daily News</em>; Edmund Gosse; and Rossetti's
      father-in-law, Ford Madox
      Brown.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">6. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
