      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I got your card of the 19th, (last Thursday's) and was greatly cheered and comforted
      thereby—the hand writing was so bold and vigorous. I had been feeling depressed and
      sorrowful—perhaps 
      my own bad state had something to do with it; but anyhow, the brave hand-writing was
      like Chevy Chace<sup><a href="#loc.03325_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> to Sidney, 
      "stirring my heart as with the sound of a trumpet." Since, I saw an item in a paper
      reporting you better, and am much encouraged. Strong
      
      hope is like strong prayer, and I shall hope for you strongly.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have sent the "Today" to Dr. Bucke.<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> The article was pleasing.
   </p>
   
   <p>One of the <u>Transcripts</u> you sent, had a characteristic speech by Littlebill Winter.<sup><a href="#loc.03325_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> 
      He is certainly the winter of my discontent mentioned by Lord Bacon<sup><a href="#loc.03325_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> in his play of Richard III. 
      Small beast! It makes me sad to think how the Devil will suffer when he gets him.
      For spite of his faults, the prince of darkness is a gentleman, and how can he endure
      such company!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hear from Bucke pretty often. He is surely a saint.</p>
   
   <p>We had had heavenly weather until yesterday, which was a swelterer. But today is good
      again.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been overrun this week, but held back the flying hour by the hair today, just
      to send you this note.
   </p>
   
   <p>I had a nice letter this morning from Mr. Traubel,<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r5">5</a></sup> to whom I will write soon.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope this will find you comfortable. Au revoir.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03325_n1">1. "The Ballad of Chevy Chase,"
      a popular ancient oral ballad about a battle brought on by an English nobleman
      leading a large hunting party onto Scottish land in the Cheviot Hills, was
      praised by the English poet Philip Sidney (1554–1586).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03325_n2">3.  Writer and theater critic
      William Winter (1836–1917) knew Whitman at Pfaff's beer cellar, and over
      the years Whitman increasingly considered him an antagonist; late in his life,
      Whitman commented: "Some of my enemies are malignants—for instance,
      Littlebill Winter, as O'Connor calls him, . . . and others of that
      stripe—violently on the other side—Winter especially—Winter,
      who is a little man in all ways: little in body, little in soul, little in
      spirit—a dried-up cadaverous school-master who flourishes his nasty
      doctrines threateningly over the heads of the anointed." See Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html"> Sunday, August 5, 1888 </a>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03325_n3">4. O'Connor was a believer in
      the so-called "Baconian theory." Francis Bacon (1561–1626) was an English
      philosopher, scientist, statesman, and author. Bacon's personal notebooks and
      works came under scrutiny during the nineteenth-century because of suspicions
      that he had written plays under the pen-name William Shakespeare in order to
      protect his political office from material some might find objectionable. For
      more on the Baconian theory, see Henry William Smith, <em>Was Lord
         Bacon The Author of Shakespeare's Plays?: A Letter to Lord Ellesmere</em>
      (London: William Skeffington, 1856).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">5. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
