      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend, 
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>Your note<sup><a href="#clc.00001_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> with $20 from a friend, (formerly a Breckenridge democrat) came safe. Doctor, I have been away for a few days, but have now returned to remain
      here certainly for the winter &amp; ensuing spring, &amp; probably for two or three years.
      I feel much possessed with the wounded &amp; sick soldiers—they have taken a powerful
      hold of me, &amp; I am very happy among them—it is perhaps the greatest interchange of
      magnetism human relations are capable of—I have told you how young &amp; how American
      they mostly are—so on my own account—I shall continue as a missionary among them as
      sure as I live—I shall continue for years—tell your friend that his mony is being distributed as mony or what little purchas I find appropriate for the men of all states—I reject none of course—not rebel wounded
      nor blacks, nor any when I find them suffering &amp; dying—Doctor to the other friends
      that assisted me in Boston &amp; to yourself, I send my regards &amp; love
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Dr. Le Baron Russell
      (1814–1819) was a Boston physician who was well acquainted with Ralph
      Waldo Emerson and James Redpath. Along with other philanthropically-minded
      citizens, Russell sent Whitman money to be used in easing the suffering of the
      Civil War wounded languishing in the Washington, D.C., area.
