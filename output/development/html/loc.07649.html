   <p>Superb sunny day again &amp; I am feeling all as right as could be
      expected—Still on mutton broth with toast &amp; plenty of rice &amp; a few
      mouthfuls of the stew'd mutton. As I told you, bowel action fair—A little
      of what I call cold in the head, but slight so far—Dr Walsh<sup><a href="#n4144" id="r2">2</a></sup> here last evn'g—he himself quite unwell—no Osler<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r3">3</a></sup> now for a fortnight—I enclose Mrs:
      O'C[onnor]'s<sup><a href="#n4138" id="r4">4</a></sup> card rec'd this mn'g—Ed: Stafford<sup><a href="#n0589" id="r5">5</a></sup> has been here—they are 
      all well as usual &amp; every thing goes on the same as of old—
   </p>
   
   <p>So we have commenced on another year—&amp; where it will take us, &amp; 
      <em>how</em>, are indeed mercifully hidden—for the <em>pique</em> of weaving &amp; watching 
      (with a gambler's uncertainty) makes the background &amp; basis of the 
      whole business—I have been reading "Goethe's &amp; Carlyle's correspondence"<sup><a href="#n6164" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      wh' I find interesting—presents C in a different light from any 
      other—

      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07649_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr R M Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden (?)
      | Jan 2 | 6 AM | 89.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4144">2. Dr. Walsh was the brother of
      William S. Walsh (1854–1919), an American author and editor of <em>Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</em>. Richard Maurice Bucke
      arranged to have him accompany Dr. William Osler to see Whitman, since Bucke
      believed it would be useful to have a younger doctor examine the poet. See
      Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.35.html">Wednesday, December 5, 1888</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4302">3. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on
      Osler, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitman-dev.unl.edu/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_202.html">Osler, Dr. William (1849–1919)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on the relationship of Osler and
      Whitman, see Michael Bliss, <em>William Osler: A Life in
         Medicine</em> (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n4138">4. Jean was the daughter of William D.
      and Ellen O'Connor. William speaks often in his letters of Jean, calling her by
      her nicknames of "Jenny" or "Jeannie."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0589">5. Edwin Stafford (1856–1906) was the brother of
      Harry Stafford, a close acquaintance of Whitman.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6164">6. It is likely that Whitman is
      referring to the volume entitled <em>Correspondence between Goethe
         and Carlyle</em>, edited by Charles Eliot Norton and published in 1887 by
      Macmillan and Co.<a href="#r6">[back]
