      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Uncle W,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your very kind letter of the 16th was duly received and appreciated to the best of
      my ability. We had a grand reception at our place last week for this town and two
      adjoining ones which was quite a success for a country place like this. I presume
      there can be more costly ones got up in New York and other cities and perhaps better
      music and shaking but for a right down good place for a peson to enjoy themselves
      and get enough to eat and of that which is eatable give me Cedar Lake or any other Lake in preference to any city.
      One of our lady neighbors who is fond of a good joke cooked a coon that was caught
      trespassing in a corn field it looked very nicely I tell you and was soon pretty well
      demolished before anyone knew what it was  after a while someone asked what kind of
      meat it was when the lady very innocently told them it was nothing but a coon  when
      some of the more fastidious ones made up awful faces as though they had a very bad
      feeling at the stomach but I did not believe it went below the chin.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have shown your Pho[tograph] only in the family and they all think it must belong to a kind old man but when I
      tell them the age of the original (why does it not seem possible but [they] are glad
      that I found one friend in the hospital  I am gaining strength very fast. I walk a
      little with one crutch and cane. Mr Wood is with me yet and improving in health and
      flesh. I do not know whether there are any characters among my neighbors that would
      interest you particular or not they are like most of our country people kindly and
      well meaning  I see by the paper that Armory Squre is discontinued and the patients
      are removed to Douglass Hospital. I received a letter each from Fraser and Dr. Smith.<sup><a href="#loc.00608_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> Are you personally or were you rather acquainted with Henry Thoreau? I saw in some
      extracts of Thoreau's letters a few days since a sort of discription of yourself, and so I supposed you must have met him. I sent the paper by Fraser
      several days ago. I have not been far enough away from home since I came here to get
      any photographs but expect to in a few weeks when I shall not forget to whom I am
      indebted for like favors. Remember me with kindness to any whom you may meet that
      remembers me. And please write me how Hiram is getting along for I feel much interest
      in his welfare.<sup><a href="#loc.00608_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anson Ryder, Jr., a
      soldier, had apparently left Armory Square Hospital and returned to his family
      at Cedar Lake, New York, accompanied by another injured soldier named Wood
      (probably Calvin B. Wood; see Edward F. Grier, ed., <em>Notes and
         Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961â€“1984], 6:673).
