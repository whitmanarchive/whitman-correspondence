      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#nyp.00187_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I rec'd this morning your additional contribution of $5 for the wounded &amp; sick. The
      same am't from you was also duly &amp; thankfully received last month. It is some time
      since I have written you.<sup><a href="#nyp.00187_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> I have lately been down to front a second time through the field hospitals—they are
      breaking them up &amp; sending the bad cases up here. I suppose preparatory to some movement
      of course. Among the sick diarrhea &amp; rheumatism are prevalent. Many of the cases of
      the latter suffer fearfully. I am writing this in hospital as I am watching here to-night
      over a bad case.
   </p>
   
   <p>(Describe scene.)<sup><a href="#nyp.00187_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>With me here things are about the same. I have first-rate health &amp; strength. My hospital
      ministrations are very fascinating with all of their sadness. The wounded &amp; sick get
      incredibly near to one. Poor young men, they respond so affectionately to kindness
      &amp; magnetism.<sup><a href="#nyp.00187_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I suppose you hear of Grant's plan to improve enormously the communication between
      here &amp; the southwest by rail &amp;c. so that he can transport the army by immense trains
      hither &amp; yon at short notice. They say he has staked all on taking Richmond within
      three months. God prosper him.
   </p>
   
   <p>Our Virginia Army is in prime condition. This I know from personal observation. All
      its defeats &amp; slaughters have only hardened it, &amp; made it an army of fighters. I believe
      Grant realizes in his secret heart that it is the clear superior in fibre &amp; soul of
      his Western Army, but of course he would not say so.
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear friend, the sick are coming in here now from front pretty freely. I have need
      of means additional—The new sick &amp; wounded generally come in without a cent. I give
      aid of all kinds, sometimes little sums of money. You have been generous &amp; regular
      in your aid, &amp; I cannot call on you for any thing more than you are doing, but I would
      like you to cast around among your friends, show them this note, &amp; tell them the case—see
      if you could raise among them some 20 or $25 the ensuing week, if possible, for it
      is for a sacred object.<sup><a href="#nyp.00187_n100" id="r5">5</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Moses Lane was chief
      engineer in the Brooklyn Water Works. Like Jeff, he collected money from his
      employees and friends. Lane sent Whitman various sums which he acknowledged in
      letters. In his letter of , Lane
      pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in the Berg Collection,
      Whitman, wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum
      of money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York,
      (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted
      Whitman in other ways. He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal welfare that
      on , he sent through Jeff $5 "for
      your own especial benefit."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00187_n2">1. This appears to be a
      rough copy of a letter to Moses Lane (see Whitman's letter from ), who, according to his letter on
      May 27, 1863 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection), had promised to send Whitman $5
      each month for his hospital work. March 13, 1864 is a plausible date, since Jeff
      had enclosed $5 from Lane on March 11, 1864 (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00187_n3">2. Although Whitman ran
      vertical lines through the salutation and the first three sentences, they are
      retained here because they permit reasonable conjectures as to the date and
      recipient.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00187_n4">3. This is, of course, a
      direction to Whitman. Here he undoubtedly intended to include material similar
      to that in a letter from  addressed to
      Nicholas Wyckoff or Daniel L.
      Northrup.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00187_n5">4. Whitman deleted the
      following at this point: "It is wonderful to go round among them, &amp; twice
      blessed. One wonders too where all the enormous proceeds . . ."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00187_n100">5. This letter is a
      draft.<a href="#r5">[back]
