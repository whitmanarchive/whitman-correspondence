      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you by this mail the "Dark Blue" containing the second
      part of Noel's article. I think the illustration horrid. It makes
      you look like a sick monkey. I wonder Hennessy could draw such
      a 
      charicature
      
      . From what Conway said I inferred he had seen it and
      approved of it. I shall tell him what I think about it. I do not think the article
      amounts to [
      <span class="unclear">shucks?</span>]
      
      either. Rossetti said Noel was very much engrossed with
      politics, and it is evident he is engrossed with something else than poetry to write
      such a [
      <span class="unclear">mess!?</span>]
      
      Of course the
      article helps, but after 
      Dowdens
      
       noble paper it seems ineffectual enough, though
      Conway seemed to think it the more feeling of the two.—I have not seen Conway
      or Rossetti since I came back from Paris. I shall see Rossetti again but I do not
      seem to care much about Conway. I doubt if I could ever fraternize with him. He does
      not impress me as an eminently sincere and loveable person. It may be very cruel for
      me to say so, but he seems to me like a kind of literary broker, ever on his make,
      though I have no complaints to make of his treatment of me &amp; it may be if I knew
      him better I should like him more. Rossetti I
      am drawn toward, and though my first impression of him was that he was a high flown
      literary cockney, yet I soon saw that it was of no [
      <span class="unclear">merit?</span>]
       and that he was a genuine good fellow.
      He praises Prof. Dowden whom he has met and says I will like him. I intend to go to
      Ireland if possible, though it looks doubtful &amp; now as Assistant Secretary
      Richardson has impressed me into his service here &amp; proposes to
      retain me &amp; my party a week or two later that we had contemplated staying. I am
      at work in the office or Branch of the Treasury Dept here with 4 or 5 other
      clerks and the beautiful October
      days are slipping by and I am not tramping about Stratford or up the mountains of
      Wales or into Ireland as I had promised
      myself I should be. I have seen enough of cities &amp; streets &amp; art and
      pictures &amp; museums to stand me all the rest of my days, and am in a hurry to set
      my face westward. I spent about a week in Paris &amp; got enough of it. I presume I
      was a little surprised when I went from here, so that I did not relish Paris as I
      should have done had I came to it fresh. It is certainly a very beautiful city and
      very clean &amp; tasteful. The ruins are in excellent taste &amp; are the best
      behaved ruins I ever saw, and the Parisians are the best measured people I ever saw.
      I think the waiters in the Hotels could give lessons to princes. They bring you
      fried eggs on a perfumed napkin, and the napkin on beautiful tissue paper &amp; the
      whole on a china plate (my paper has got mixed up) and one hardly knows
      whether to face to &amp; eat or to lift up his hands in admiration. Yet from all
      that I was not deeply impressed with Paris. The aspect of the streets is very 
      monotenous
      
      . See one block &amp; you have seen it all. It all seems to have been built
      the same day &amp; planned by the same architect &amp; the stone were unmistakably
      all dug from the same quarry. Hence it is not picturesque or quaint or homely like
      London or grand either: it is brilliant &amp; correct. I was much disappointed in
      the French soldiers; they are certainly a very inferior looking lot of men; small
      &amp; dirty &amp; indifferent. I find this is the impression of all Americans I have
      talked with who have seen them. I
      believe there are but two more parties coming over with bonds. I hope you &amp;
      William will be among
      them. I wrote quite a long letter to William which I hope he received. I have seen
      Carlyle as I told him and liked him very much. I am
      sure you would like him &amp; that he would like you. But I must close, dear Walt,
      hoping to be in 
      W.
      
       ahead of the snow birds.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see

      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
