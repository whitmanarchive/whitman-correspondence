      <br></br><br></br>Dear Herbert Gilchrist
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of July 21 just rec'd, soliciting some definite word from me ab't an English
      or
      transatlantic "free will offering"—a proposed affectionate and voluntary gift
      to me from my friends there.<sup><a href="#upa.00078_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I feel deeply, even for the
      prompting of it, and should decidedly and gratefully accept any thing it produces.
      (My publisher David McKay, of Philadelphia, has just been over to pay the last
      half-annual royalty on my two Volumes <u>Leaves of Grass</u> and
      <u>Specimen Days</u>, which amounted to twenty-two dollars
      and six cents—this being the income to me from the sale of my books for the
      last six months.)<sup><a href="#upa.00078_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Fearfully hot weather here. I have had a sunstroke which has made me weak, and kept
      me indoors for the last twelve days; but I move around the house, eat my rations
      fairly, write a little, and shall quite certainly soon resume my usual state of
      health, late times—(doubtless lower'd a slight notch or two, as I find that is
      the way things go on year after year.) Fortunately I have a good faithful young
      Jersey woman and friend, Mary Davis, who cooks for me, and vigilantly sees to
      me.<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Give my love to Wm M. Rossetti<sup><a href="#upa.00078_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> and to all enquiring
      friends, known or unknown.
   </p>
   
   <p>You are at liberty to make any use of this letter you see fit.<sup><a href="#upa.00078_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00078_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Mrs: Gilchrist | 12 Well Road | Hampstead | London | England. It is postmarked:
      Camden | Aug 1 | 5 PM | 1885 | N.J.; London N [illegible] | 7 U |
      Au 14[illegible] | [illegible]. Whitman made a mistake
      in addressing the envelope.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00078_n2">2. Anne Gilchrist on , in what was to be her last letter to the
      poet, spoke of the eagerness of many young men in England to show their
      affection for Whitman. For this reason they inserted a paragraph in <em>The Athenaeum</em> on July 11 soliciting funds, but were
      disturbed by a notice in the Camden <em>Daily Post</em> of July 3
      "which seems decisively to bid us desist!" The <em>Daily Post</em>
      reprinted W. H. Ballou's interview with the poet from the Cleveland <em>Leader and Herald</em> on June 28, in which Whitman was
      quoted: "My income is just sufficient to keep my head above water—and what
      more can a poet ask?" <em>The Athenaeum</em> said in part: "The
      poet is in his sixty-seventh year, and has . . . maintained himself precariously
      by the sale of his works in poetry and prose, and by occasional contributions to
      magazines."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00078_n3">3. Whitman did not include
      his much larger income from the sales of poems and prose to magazines and
      newspapers (see the letter from Whitman to William Michael Rossetti of ). On December 1, 1885, he
      received $20.71 in payment of royalties from McKay for the preceding six months
      (University of Pennsylvania).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6113">4. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_92.html">Davis, Mary Oakes (1837 or 1838–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00078_n4">5. On  Rossetti wrote to Whitman: "You will
      believe that I received with pride &amp; warm feeling the love wh. you sent me
      in a letter to Gilchrist, . . . &amp; that I reciprocate your love with
      reverential affection."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00078_n5">6. A facsimile of this
      letter was made by Gilchrist and, according to his letter of , was printed in <em>The
         Athenaeum</em> on August 22 and in the London <em>Daily
         News</em> on August 24. The New York <em>Times</em> copied the
      article in <em>The Athenaeum</em> on September 4.<a href="#r6">[back]
