   <p>We are having a devil of a time so don't be uneasy if my letters 
      shd
      
       seem a little "off the center." Our Western Fair has begun in London and
      the Asylum is full from morning to night of people to see friends and people to see
      through the institution—it is a perfect babel. Office half full all the time
      of men and women asking after friends (patients in asylum) whether they are better?
      Are they going to get better? What was the cause of their insanity? &amp;c &amp;c
      &amp;c. Meanwhile I <u>ought</u> to be writing  my annual
      report—the meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> too is likely to call on me for some attention before the
      week is out, besides other matters, so you see I am not likely to get dull for want
      of some occupation. The weather keeps lovely and all is well with us. I still hope
      to see you between the middle and end of Oct.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you are having pleasant weather and that all is going well with the
      books—I hope to see a copy of "November Boughs"<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r3">3</a></sup> this week and one of the
      "Complete Works"<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r4">4</a></sup> in the course of next week.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07247_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: LONDON | PM | SP 24 | 88 | CANADA; CAMDEN, N.J. | SEP | 2[illegible] | 1PM | [illegible] | [illegible].<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07230_n2">2. Bucke and his brother-in-law
      William John Gurd were designing a gas and fluid meter to be patented in Canada
      and sold in England.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">3. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">4. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
