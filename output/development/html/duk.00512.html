   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00512_n14">1. This letter dates to
      February 12, 1868. The day of the week, Wednesday, is in Louisa's hand, and
      Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the date February 12, 1868. Edwin Haviland Miller
      agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:365). The letter paraphrases a story about women who slipped on the ice on
      their way to a service at the church attended by Edward Whitman, Henry Ward
      Beecher's Plymouth Church. The story appeared in the <em>Brooklyn
         Daily Eagle</em> on February 10, 1868, a Monday.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00512_n2">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      presumably refers to the <em>Old Franklin Almanack, no. 9</em>
      (Philadelphia: A. Winch, 1867). According to her  letter, Walt had sent her two almanacs the previous
      year.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00512_n15">3. Though no letter from Walt
      Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from early February 1868 is extant, he
      probably forwarded newspapers with coverage of the House of Representatives,
      which was considering drawing articles of impeachment against President Andrew
      Johnson. Walt recommended that his mother "take a morning paper, the Times or
      something" because the debates on impeachment "are quite interesting now" (see
      his  letter to his mother).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00512_n3">4. For the 1868 issue, see Alex
      J. Schem, compiler, <em>The Tribune Almanac and Political
         Register</em> (New York: Tribune Association, 1867). The 1868 almanac, with
      108 pages, sold at retail for 20 cents.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n6">5. Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975), 10–11.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">6. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00512_n6">7. The church is Henry Ward
      Beecher's Plymouth Church. Beecher (1813–1887), Congregational clergyman
      and brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, accepted the pastorate of the Plymouth
      Church, Brooklyn, in 1847. The short article in the newspaper cautioned readers
      about icy streets and satirized the dedication of Beecher's parishioners. The
      seven women were "stretched upon the sidewalk, in Cranberry Street," which led
      to Plymouth Church on Fulton Street (see "The Slippery Sidewalk," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, February 10, 1868, 3). Brooklyn's
      Orange Street runs parallel to Cranberry Street.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00477_n6">8. Emily "Emmy" or "Emma" Price
      was the daughter of Abby and Edmund Price, who were friends of Walt Whitman and
      his mother. Emily and her sister Helen were regular visitors to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00512_n17">9. Mrs. Wells, presumably a
      friend of the Price family or Emily Price, has not been identified.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00512_n11">10. Mrs. Black was a neighbor
      of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. She is also mentioned in Louisa's , , and 
      letters to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00512_n18">11. Abby Price's "spells" were
      asthma (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). For Walt Whitman's relationship with
      Abby Hills Price (1814–1878) and family, see Sherry Ceniza, <em>Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers</em>
      (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1998), 45–95.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00512_n8">12. For Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman's February 1, 1868 letter, presumably one of these "two letters," see
      Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha
         Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      44–46. Mattie was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt
      Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa.
      Jeff moved to St. Louis in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. Mattie and her daughters joined him in early February 1868. For
      more on Mattie, see Waldron, 1–26.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">13. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">14. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00512_n16">15. Walt Whitman's February 9?,
      1868 letter (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin
      Haviland Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:360),
      though it is more likely to date February 10 or 11, 1868, is not extant. Based
      on this response from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, Walt in his letter informed
      Louisa that he was again working on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.
      Presumably, he had begun the revisions that led to the fifth American edition
      (1871–72). For more on that edition, see Lee Mancuso, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_25.html">Leaves of Grass, 1871–72 Edition</a>."According to Mancuso, Walt
      Whitman began revising for the fifth edition "as early as summer 1869," but this
      letter indicates that he was writing or revising <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> actively in February 1868. If Whitman's revision for the
      1871–72 edition began in early 1868, the correspondence concerning William
      Michael Rossetti's expurgated London edition may have played a significant role
      in prompting Whitman to return to his poems (see <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/british/index.html">Poems by Walt Whitman. Selected and Edited by William Michael
            Rossetti</a></em> [London: Hotten, 1868]).<a href="#r15">[back]
