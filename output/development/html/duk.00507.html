   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00507_n8">1. This letter dates to October
      30, 1867. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter only "wensday," and Richard
      Maurice Bucke later assigned the date of October 30, 1867. Edwin Haviland Miller
      agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:378). October 30 fell on a Wednesday in 1867. The letter's concerns are
      consistent with Louisa's  and  letters to Walt Whitman, and a
      brief notice on Walt Whitman in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>
      also corresponds to the date.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00507_n11">2. Walt Whitman's October 29?, 1867 letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman is not extant.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00507_n12">3. Walt Whitman's October 15?,
      1867 letter with ten dollars enclosed went missing (see Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00507_n9">4. The names of the "families
      up stairs" have not been identified.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00507_n7">5. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      hoped that the prescribed medicine would improve her appetite (see her  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">6. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00502_n3">7. The nickname "Sis" refers to
      Jessie Louisa Whitman (1863–1957), the daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Jessie and her sister Manahatta "Hattie" were both favorites of
      their uncle Walt. The nickname "Sis" was given first to Manahatta but was passed
      to her younger sister Jessie Louisa when Manahatta became "Hattie."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">8. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00507_n5">9. The book may be William D.
      O'Connor's <em>The Ghost</em> (New York: G.P. Putnam, 1867). For a
      time Walt Whitman lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with
      Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates
      during the Washington years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the
      author of the pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00507_n6">10. The <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> printed this brief note: "Walt Whitman is about
      to answer [Thomas] Carlyle's last anti-democratic screed" ("Topics of To-Day,"
      October 29, 1867, 2).<a href="#r10">[back]
