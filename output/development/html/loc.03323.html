      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>A Happy New Year!</p>
   
   <p>I send you the article on Mrs Gilchrist's book from the <u>Nation</u>, for which I have never ceased hunting, and which I found where it
      had no business to be. You will observe that the holy Father sprinkles us with an
      aspergillus full of ice water. The cold impudence of that <u>Nation</u> surpasses.
   </p>
   
   <p>Sometime when you are sending you can return me the article for my collection.</p>
   
   
   <p>I have for some time wanted to write to you, but have been strangely ill, and only
      just able to walk through the office duties. I keep up my spirits as well as I can,
      but find it all pretty depressing.
   </p>
   
   <p>The article by the wretch named Willard<sup><a href="#loc.03323_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> in the American
      Magazine filled me with indignation. What a beast a man must be who comes to you
      with a letter of introduction, and goes off to caricature and lampoon you in a
      magazine!
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you have read "King Solomon's Mines."<sup><a href="#loc.03323_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> It is
      immense. I have read it forty times, I do believe. The battle chapters let one into
      the spirit of Homer as the translations cannot do.  I wish somebody would rightly
      review it for the benefit of the Boston school.
   </p>
   
   <p>I see the little pieces you send forth. "Yonnondio" is beautiful.<sup><a href="#loc.03323_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> The Boston <u>Advertiser</u>, which
      also has for you an aspergil of ice-water, copied it, which is an act of
      tribute.—I think your term, "Shakespeare-Bacon,"<sup><a href="#loc.03323_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      will stick to Verulam.<sup><a href="#loc.03323_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Donnelly<sup><a href="#n4108" id="r6">6</a></sup> is,
      I guess, in England, getting out his English edition. I have not heard from him
      since October, and await his movements on tiptoe.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you are keeping reasonably well. Au revoir.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03323_n1">1.  O'Connor is likely
      referring to Cyrus Field Willard (1858–1942), an American journalist,
      political activist, and theosophist. In the December 1887 edition of <em>The American Magazine</em>, Willard dramatizes an interview he
      conducted with Whitman. Willard's depiction of Whitman is as a venerated but
      paralyzed man, whose speech is overwrought with contractions and elided
      syllables. Willard ends by appropriating Whitman's free verse and form in an
      improvised, perhaps satirical, poem entitled "America's Greeting to Walt." For
      the published interview, see Cyrus Williard, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00545.html">A Chat With The Good Gray Poet</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.03323_n3">2. British adventure writer H.

   <p id="loc.03323_n2">3. Whitman's poem "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00024.html">Yonnondio</a>" was published in the <em>Critic</em> on

      (1831–1901) was a politician and writer, well known for his notions of
      Atlantis as an antediluvian civilization and for his belief that Shakespeare's
      plays had been written by Francis Bacon, an idea he argued in his book <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in Shakespeare's
         Plays</em>, published in 1888.<a href="#r6">[back]
