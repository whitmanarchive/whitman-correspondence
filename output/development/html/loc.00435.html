      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>As I was at the office and nothing particular to do this evening I thought I would
      have a little talk with you
   </p>
   
   <p>Did you see the Tribune of to-day—It had a long letter from Mr Richardson about the
      exchange of prisoners<sup><a href="#loc.00435_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I thought strongly and well written—to-night's Evening Post extracts quite a long
      passage from it.<sup><a href="#loc.00435_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> How horrible the whole thing is. It does seem as if the Government could hardly dare
      to turn a deaf ear to the call for an exchange—I wish you could write upon the same
      subject and keep it before the reading public—I intend to send another box to George
      this week if I can—oh if he could only get them—What do you think about it—is it Grant's
      policy, after all, that prevents a general exchange—do you learn anything about the
      matter—I wrote you a few days ago about trying to get a special exchange of George
      through a letter from John Swinton<sup><a href="#loc.00435_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—what do you think of it—I have thought a great deal about it and think it perhaps
      might work
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing new with us—yesterday the landlord sent over word that he should
      want more rent for the house—he did not say how much more &nbsp;I told Mat and Mother that
      we would tell him to set the price on the part we occupy and if we did not wish to
      pay it we would move—I suppose it will be some weeks yet before we know how much he
      wants—but one thing is certain I am not going to make and have such a time as we all
      did last year<sup><a href="#loc.00435_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &nbsp;Mother is quite well—I think to-day [she] is [or] seems in better spirits than usual—Mat
      has been over to New York "looking for work" as usual to-day with partial success
      I believe—and as a matter of course bought a new carpet and some other things. The
      children are getting along first-rate
   </p>
   
   <p>Somehow I dont see as much of the Dr<sup><a href="#loc.00435_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> as I used to &nbsp;the last time I saw him he asked how you was getting along and how
      you felt—He exp[r]esses a desire to learn in regard to your health—So you like your
      place—I am glad of that—for it makes it much more pleasant to have a steady income
      per month if one can only not dislike the duties that are to be performed for it—I
      hope to be able to come and see you some time this month
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been quite exercised lately about trying to build a little "extension of a
      house" on the lot in Flatbush Av.—but have about come to the conclusion that I had
      better wait—material is so very high just now and I should have to borrow the money
      which would cost me say on a $1000. $100 for the coming year—well the rent for the
      year will not be much more than that and dont you think that things must be cheaper before another year—What is your idea of this
      peace business<sup><a href="#loc.00435_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—is there anything in it. It seems to me as if there is &nbsp;I think if they once get
      to talking in earnest that it must come without much more fighting
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish you would write me quite often Walt &nbsp;somehow since you went away this time
      I have felt lonely—I suppose its because I dwell so much on the thought that something
      ought to be done to see if we can't do something to help George. Oh if we only could
      it seems to me it would be worth almost a life time—Jess I have not heard from since
      you went away &nbsp;I suppose I ought to go see him but they are taking such quantities
      of small pox patients out to that hospital (even out in the cars they take them) that
      I am almost afraid to &nbsp;We are having an immense quantity sick with that disease—and
      the excitement is quite intense
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Just now in looking over the Evening Post I saw among the musical gossip a notice
      that our old friend Bettini was winning great success in Warsaw<sup><a href="#loc.00435_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—tis the fist time I have seen his name in 10 or 12 years—I've no doubt the mention
      of his name will call to you many pleasant thoughts—those were very pleasant times
      Walt.
   </p>
   
   <p>Of course any information in relation to George—or about the exchange—or treatment
      of prisoners—or what not that relates to keeping up a fellows courage you will write
      me at once
   </p>
   
   <p>All send their love</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00435_n1">1. On February 3, the <em>New York Tribune</em> devoted two and a half columns to Albert
      D. Richardson's "Our Prisoners in the South." Richardson had been imprisoned at
      Salisbury, North Carolina, from February 3, 1864, to December 18, 1864, when he
      escaped. Richardson not only argued that the Confederates were "deliberately
      killing" Union men, but he also attacked the inactivity of "well-fed and
      well-clothed Senators in their warm chamber...[and] cushioned chairs....I wish
      they would look into those foul pens at Salisbury, which by a perversion of the
      English tongue are called hospitals;...I wish they could look on the dead cart
      with its rigid forms, piled upon each other like logs—the stark swaying arms—the
      white, ghostly faces, with their dropped jaws and their staring, stony eyes—...I
      think a few hours in the stillness of that garrison...would change their view on
      the matter."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00435_n2">2. Under the headline "The
      Peach Question" the <em>Evening Post</em> for February 3 quoted
      three paragraphs from Richardson's letter, including his comments on the high
      mortality rates.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>

      letter to Walt from .<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.00435_n4">4. See Jeff's letter to
      Walt from .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00435_n5">5. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Jeff and Mattie Whitman. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest
      in his practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles
      Gems" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:90, n. 85).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00435_n6">6. Newspapers of the day
      were filled with rumors of an impending meeting between Union and Confederate
      leaders at Fortress Monroe, Virginia. See Jeff's letter to Walt from .<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00435_n7">7. "Bettini and his wife
      Trebelti have been winning successes in various Italian operas in Warsaw" (<em>New York Times</em>, February 3, 1865). Although Allesandro
      Bettini performed in New York for only a year (December 5, 1850, to about
      February 1852), he was Whitman's favorite tenor (Robert D. Faner, <em>Walt Whitman &amp; Opera</em> [Carbondale: Southern Illinois
      University Press, 1951], 59–61; see also Jeff's letter to Walt from ).<a href="#r7">[back]
