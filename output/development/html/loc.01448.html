      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have sent you a small Box of Books carriage Paid to your address in Washington.
      I
      expect it will leave Liverpool on Wednesday the 13th so I expect you will have it
      very soon after the arrival of this letter.<sup><a href="#uva.00363_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> I regret I
      could not send you some Indian Books I had in view when I wrote you some time ago.
      I
      mean the Bhagavad Gita—and the Vedas. the last is a work at present only published
      for the Scholars and Students it is in [
      <span class="unclear">8?</span>]
       large octavo volumes.— and will not all be published this year.
      However the Collection is a representative one as you will find on looking over the
      list. I have few of them so relating to our 
      modren
      
       Literature as you will observe they are by men whom I highly esteem though
      I do not endorse or hold by all they teach two of the Books are connected with my
      own thoughts and Studies. Time &amp; Tide and the progress of the Working Classes
      from 1832 to 1868, compiled by two warm advocates of the working Classes. the memoir
      of Bewick is also a work I love and esteem and one that i think will be  read by you with
      pleasure and also delight, as the utterances of a real noble honest soul, free from
      all pretensions of culture or Book-making, a truly representative Man, and lover of
      Nature, and natural Life. it is a Book I would fain see more known here and in
      America, it is so brimful of good sound sense. There is also a Portrait of Dante
      &amp; Milton both photographed by admirers of your works, and reading 
      Pamphelets
      
       by [illegible]
      other warm admirers of your Book, and lastly there is 2 remarkable Indian 
      Pamphelets
      
       Jesus Christ Europe &amp; Asia by Chunder Sen, an 
      Hindoo
      
      —and one on Beneficent Government also written by an 
      Hindoo
      
       Philosopher
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Also 4 numbers of the Cooperator containing L. Napoleon's remarkable work the
      Extinction of Pauperism to me a very remarkable production despite his none
      fullfilment of it now that he is in power and position—The last I will name is the
      Dabistan a very remarkable Book by a Persian on the Schools of Religion in the East
      a Book after your own heart I think one that will be dear to you indeed, or I am
      much mistaken in your love of Books, interspersed with fine stanzas of oriental
      Poetry, altogether in my opinion a real Book. and then the 
      Sacconitala
      
       &amp; Indian Drama—the Flowery Scrawl, a Chinese Novel. These few
      fragments I hope will help to lift the Veil of the East to thee.

   <p>P.S. In Emerson's<sup><a href="#n0218" id="r2">2</a></sup> new Book Society and Solitude, the
      Essay upon Books makes references to several oriental Books. I hope that notice
      of them will promote their publication by some Publisher or else some Society
      will be formed to do it. people who are lovers of the Writings of Emerson &amp;
      Mazzini<sup><a href="#n0392" id="r3">3</a></sup> ought to take the matter in hand and do it
      effectually. then we would possess the necessary works for a proper study of

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Dixon (1831–1880), a corkcutter of
      Sunderland, England, was one of Walt Whitman's early English admirers. In 1856
      he had bought copies of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> from a book
      peddler; one of these copies was later sent by William B. Scott to William
      Michael Rossetti. Dixon vigorously supported cultural projects and represented
      the ideal laborer of John Ruskin, who printed many of his own letters to the
      corkcutter in <em>Time and Tide</em> (1867). See <em>Autobiographical Notes of the Life of William Bell Scott</em>, ed. W. Minto
      (1892), II, 32–33, 267–269; Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt
         Whitman in England</em> (1934), 15–17; <em>The Works of
         John Ruskin</em>, ed. E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn (1905), XVII,
      lxxviii–lxxix.

   <p id="n0218">2. Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) was an
      American poet and essayist who began the Transcendentalist movement with his
      1836 essay <em>Nature</em>. On , Whitman informed Ralph Waldo Emerson that "" was "put in type for my own convenience,
      and to ensure greater correctness." He asked Emerson to take the poem to James
      T. Fields, editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, who promptly
      accepted it and published it in February 1869. For more on Emerson, see Jerome
