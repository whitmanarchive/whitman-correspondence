      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am well as usual, &amp; having good times—There is nothing new to tell you—I hope you
      are well, mother dear—&amp; Mat &amp; the little girls &amp; Jeff &amp; Georgy—I begin to want to
      see you all again—I hear there is a long &amp; favorable piece about me &amp; Leaves of Grass
      in an English magazine called the <em>Fortnightly Review</em>
      <sup><a href="#nyp.00212_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—one of the highest rank, too—Well, I am now going to leave off, &amp; drink a cup of
      tea—near us there is a room where the Treasury ladies work—about noon they have tea—one
      of our own clerks has a sort of sweetheart in there who sends him every day a cup
      of splendid green tea—which as he dont drink the article—he always makes over to <em>me</em>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, mother dear, good bye for this time—</p>

   <p id="nyp.00212_n2">2. Moncure Conway's article;
      see the letter of . John
      Burroughs called it "an eloquent article . . . but it told untruths about him.
      Walt said it did" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931], 39). William
      O'Connor wrote to Conway on December 5, 1866: "A great deal of it I liked very
      much, and I think the general effect of it was very good. In part of it, there
      was a tone I regretted. Pardon me. I think the time is past when this august man
      should be written of as a curiosity, or his poem mentioned as something
      monstrous. You do not do this, it is true, but there are, here and there, lines
      and touches in your article, which suggest such a treatment and leave me
      unsatisfied" (Yale). However, to John Townsend Trowbridge, O'Connor labeled it
      "a frightful mess of misstatement and fiction" (Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs</em> (1931), 40). Whitman, and therefore his friends,
      objected to two of Conway's anecdotes in particular: Whitman's lying on his back
      at Coney Island with the temperature at 100 degrees, and the description of his
      room in 1855. In 1888 Whitman observed: "I can't help feeling still a little
      suspicion of Conway's lack of historic veracity: he romances: he has romanced
      about me: William says lied: but romanced will do" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard &amp;
      Company, 1906–1996], 3:16). William Michael Rossetti repeated the Coney
      Island tale in <em>Poems by Walt Whitman</em> (London: John Camden
      Hotten, 1868), 15–16..<a href="#r2">[back]
