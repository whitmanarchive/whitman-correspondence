   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am here a while on leave—am in good health as usual—have been engaged in electrotyping
      a new edition of my book in better form—You sent me word a year or more ago of some
      Boston publisher, or bookseller, who was willing (or perhaps wished) to sell my book<sup><a href="#duk.00656_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Who was it?—I should like to have some such man there—to sell the book on commission,
      &amp; be agent, depositor, &amp;c—He will be under no expense, of course &amp; will only receive
      the books from me on sale—I wish to put his name in an advertisement list of agents—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Please answer forthwith—direct to me here.</p>

      Yours as ever

   <p>No objection to a couple of such Boston bookselling places—as agencies.
      Love to the son, dear boy.<sup><a href="#duk.00656_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Townsend Trowbridge
      was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
      Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
      Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
      Eldridge edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He again met Whitman
      in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Treasury Secretary Salmon P.
      Chase in order to gather material for his biography, <em>The Ferry
         Boy and the Financier</em> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described
      their meetings in <em>My Own Story</em>, (Boston: Houghton and
      Mifflin, 1903), 360–401, with recollections of noted persons. On December
      11, 1862, Trowbridge had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending
      Whitman; see Emerson's letter from . Though Trowbridge was not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to
      William D. O'Connor in 1867: "Every year confirms my earliest impression, that
      no book has approached the power and greatness of this book, since the Lear and
      Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A. Coleman, "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 [1951–52], 327). For
      Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.71.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> (1906–1996), 3:506. See
      also Coleman, "Trowbridge and Whitman," <em>PMLA</em>, 63 (1948),
      262–273. For several weeks in 1863, Trowbridge stayed with Whitman in
      Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William D. O'Connor.
