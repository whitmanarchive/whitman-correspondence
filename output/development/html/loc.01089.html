   </p>
   
   <p>I read with sorrow of your severe illness and beg to offer my sympathy. I have
      written to the President recommending a special pension for you and propose to
      demand it of Congress through the press. I am also preparing an article of
      reminiscences which will soon be published. With hopes for your complete recovery,
      love, and veneration, I am
   </p>

      Yours most sincerely
      <br></br>Wm Hosen Ballou

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William H. Ballou (1857–1937)
      was a journalist and natural scientist who falsely reported in the Cleveland <em>Leader and Herald</em> in 1885 that Whitman was about to go to
      England to visit Tennyson; he conducted two interviews with the poet in 1885 and
      1886. See Ballou's interview with Whitman of <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00517.html">June 28, 1885</a> for the <em>Leader and Herald</em> and
      his interview with Whitman of <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00651.html">June 12, 1886</a> for the <em>Chicago Daily
         Tribune</em>.
