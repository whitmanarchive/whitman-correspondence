      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Some days ago came my parcel—many thanks—Mr. Grosart's books included. That for Mr. Graves had come previously—I have waited a few
      days expecting to hear from my brother (from Edinburgh) of the arrival of his
      copies, but it is sometimes his way to put off writing to me too long, &amp; I have
      little doubt he has got the books safely. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Rossetti let me know from time to time any news of you that
      reached him, and I have to thank you for some newspapers now &amp; again.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>It was a real sorrow to us, dear friend, to hear of the loss of your little nephew
      &amp; name–sake. A friend of mine Harold Littledale
      watched this summer by the side of a little sister (about twenty years younger than
      himself) who died, and he told me that in the presence of death &amp; with its
      consciousness enveloping him it was words of yours which expressed the deepest
      truths of the hour &amp; the event. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Littledale is President this year of our principal society of students—in
      Trinity College, the Philosophical Society, &amp; I believe his Opening address,
      which is the event of the Session, is to be partly concerned with your poetry. It was a
      great satisfaction to me this year also, to get a kind of confession or
      self–revelation from one of the most promising men in my class of the really
      saving &amp; delivering power of your writings when he was lapsing in that lethargy
      &amp; cynicism which is one of the diseases of youth in our <u>Old</u> World, if not in your <u>New</u> one—but in
      both I 
      shd
      
       suppose).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have done too little this last summer. I copied out about 200 
      pgs
      
       of verse, &amp; am about to have them published. I will send you a copy,
      but I doubt whether you  will care for them—I don't claim to be an "Answerer"; but I do assert a
      right to be one of the tribe of the singers—"eye–singer,
      ear–singer, head–singer, sweet–singer, echo–singer,
      parlor–singer, love–singer, or something else". And these have their
      place &amp; <u>raison d'être</u>. Probably my next bit of
      work will be the arranging for publication a volume of Essays on 19th century writers, including
      Tennyson &amp; Browning, Victor
      Hugo, &amp; the Westminster Article (somewhat altered) on
      your poetry.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You asked for O'Grady's address. I don't know it at this moment;
      but he would like to get your photograph (of which you spoke) &amp; if you address
      it to my care he will get it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope the cooler weather (after so hot a summer) may do your health good. We are
      all
      well.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
