      <br></br><br></br>Dear Nelly
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have received your letter, also Charles Eldridge's &amp; Mrs Cooper's.<sup><a href="#loc.00941_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Nelly, I hope this will find you better of your cold, &amp; that you &amp; all the rest are
      well &amp; [in] good spirits.<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n100" id="r2">2</a></sup> Tell Mrs Cooper I heartily accept her invitation to visit at Philadelphia, &amp; if I
      can work it so I will come gladly. I think about you all, &amp; frequently. I have told
      my mother &amp; sister about you all. I send my love to William. I feel that I have never
      had a better friend, &amp; that no truer nor warmer heart beats. Tell Charles Eldridge
      too I send him my love. I regret his not likely meeting me in New York to go around
      together. But, Charley, we will have it yet, dear comrade. I received the letters
      you sent under envelope. For all &amp; sundry, &amp; the year's most valuable kindness, from
      you three, what can I say, more than that I am sure I appreciate it.
      Nelly, I had a pleasant trip that Monday from the start, &amp; all through—clear &amp; cool
      &amp; no dust—I got home about 8 in evening—was up bright &amp; early to the polls next morning
      &amp;c. How well the election went in this state, you know.<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Here Brooklyn gave a stunning union vote, the biggest ever dreamed of here—Mayor,
      assemblymen, judges, all elected. Nelly, I am writing this from my room at my mother's
      house. It is Sunday afternoon, dripping &amp; rainy, the air thick &amp; warm, &amp; the sky lowering.
      My poor brother Andrew is very ill. It is not likely he can live. His voice is quite
      gone. Still he moves about &amp; is here all the time during the day. My sister Martha
      is untiring, feeding &amp; nursing him. Of her children, little Hattie is well—the new
      baby is immense, &amp; I take to her in proportion. I want her to be called California.
      She is fully worthy the name. She is large, calm, not pretty but something ahead of
      that, full of latent fire in the eyes (which are grey) &amp; a complete success every
      way. Mother is very well &amp; active &amp; cheerful—she still does her own light housework,
      &amp; keeps up handsomely under her surroundings of domestic pressure—one case of sickness
      &amp; its accompanying irritability—two of grown helplessness<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—&amp; the two little children, very much with her, &amp; one of them unsurpassed in volatility
      &amp; restlessness—Nelly, I have thought before that the real &amp; best bravery is to be
      discovered somewhere else than in the bravery of war, &amp; beyond the heroisms of men.
      My brother Jeff is well—he is a noble young man &amp; one to love.
   </p>
   
   <p>I find my New York boys the same gay-hearted, joyous fellows, full of friendship &amp;
      determined to have pleasure. We have been together quite a good deal. They have given
      me little supper parties, men only, with drinking &amp;c. Of course we have great times.
      I have been several times to the Opera &amp; to French theatre. The opera here, Maretzek's
      troupe,<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> is very fine. Medori, soprano, is pretty near perfection—Mazzoleni, tenor, ditto—Biachi,
      base, ditto. Miss Kellogg is also good. The pieces were Lucrezia, Sonnambula, &amp;c.<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Nelly, I have seen Charles Howells.<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> He is well—apparently indeed better than he was in Washington (in health I mean).
      I have been at the place, 15 Charles street. In the parlor is hung up a large blue
      placard "Headquarters of the Pantarchy" in white letters. I did not stop to dinner,
      although I was prest hard. I saw a man named Newbold.<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> Charles Howells is cheerful. We had quite a walk. He told me he was doing well in
      a business point of view, had made more while in New York than his salary would have
      been in Idaho. I did not see Mr nor Mrs Andrews.<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> I did not make any demonstration upon Charles, except what was probably significant
      enough during the course of his flourishing &amp; somewhat elaborated statement of the
      Pantarchian scheme which I listened to in dead silence, broken only by one or two
      running questions of a very brief &amp; dry character. Charles was full of friendship
      &amp; our interview was one in which he imprest me more agreeably than ever before. Surely
      he is a good man. The impression I received (maybe casual) is that he is partially
      absorbed there, his own yearning &amp; eager nature supplying the fuel of the flame, but
      that he is really shrewd at bottom, &amp; may prove more able to pick his way through
      the humbugs of the world than we were thinking.
   </p>
   
   <p>Nelly, I have seen Mrs Price, but not to have much true &amp; friendly talk, as there
      were many present. She is much <em>less</em> well than I expected—has a hacking cough. She preserves the same quiet cheerful way—&amp;
      her daughters—dear girls—<em>they are all friends</em>, to prize &amp; love deeply.
   </p>
   
   <p>Nelly, if you go down to Armory Square—or if Mrs Howells should, (&amp; if you feel well,
      &amp; like going, I much wish you would very soon) please find if Pleasant Borley<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> is living, he is in bed 40 in Ward A—tell him I am coming back soon, (or tell Miss
      Gregg,<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup> for him)—Also see James S Stilwell<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n12" id="r12">12</a></sup> in Ward C, &amp; Thomas Carson<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n13" id="r13">13</a></sup> in same ward—also Lewis K Brown<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n14" id="r14">14</a></sup> in Ward K, (I have sent him a long letter)—also Oscar Cunningham<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n15" id="r15">15</a></sup> in Ward K—also tell Mrs Doolittle<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n16" id="r16">16</a></sup> in Ward B, I want to see the boys there. I shall probably stay five or six days longer.
      I count on our all being together again. My head &amp; hearing &amp;c. are better yesterday
      &amp; to-day than for two weeks—sometimes have been rather disagreeable. Well, Nelly,
      I will now bid you good bye for present, my truly dear friend, &amp; good bye to the rest,
      &amp; God bless you all.<sup><a href="#nyp.00185_n17" id="r17">17</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years, and he speaks often in his letters of their daughter Jean, by nickname
      "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break in late
      1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated black citizens,
      Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence between Whitman and
      Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00941_n1">1. In December 1862, on his
      way to visit his brother George at Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt Whitman
      stopped in Washington and encountered Charles W. Eldridge, who was now a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster. After he had seen for himself that George
      had not been severely wounded, he returned to Washington, which was to be his
      home until 1873. Eldridge obtained a desk for Whitman in the office of Major
      Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster. The identity of Mrs. Cooper is unclear. A
      Mrs. Cooper is mentioned in Whitman's notation on Ellen O'Connor's letter of
      , and on , O'Connor informed Whitman that
      Eldridge was going to stay at Mrs. Cooper's home in Philadelphia for several
      days. This is undoubtedly the Hattie B. Cooper (listed in the Directory as C. H.
      B. Cooper, "gentlewoman") who in an undated letter sent a "Christmas Greeting"
      to Whitman—"from one who has the <em>heart</em>—but
      not the <em>head</em>—of a poet, and consequently feels a
      sincere admiration and reverence for those Gifted Mortals, who possess both"
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). Fred Vaughan referred to who is likely a
      different Mrs. Cooper on ; the Mrs.
      Cooper of Vaughan's letters was the mother of his roommate Robert "Bob" Cooper
      after Vaughan left Whitman's Classon Avenue apartment.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00185_n100">2. For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Eldridge and later Burroughs,
      were to be his close associates during the early Washington years. William D.
      O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>,
      an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. Ellen "Nelly"
      O'Connor, William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In
      1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with William over the Fifteenth
      Amendment, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended
      Whitman's opinion, and in response William established a separate residence. The
      correspondence between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's
      correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00185_n3">3. See note 4 in Whitman's
      letter from 
      .<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00185_n4">4. According to Miller,
      Edward and Jesse Whitman were mentally handicapped.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00185_n5">5. Max Maretzek
      (1821–1897), opera impressario, was the most successful producer of
      Italian opera in New York City from 1849 to 1879.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00185_n6">6. Clara Louise Kellogg
      (1842–1916) sang in <em>La Sonnambula</em> on November 13,
      1863. Giuseppini Medori sang <em>Lucrezia Borgia</em> on November
      2; see Whitman's account of this opera in a letter from 
      . In Peri's <em>Judith</em> on November 11, 1863, appeared Medori, Mazzoleni,
      and Biachi. See George Odell, <em>Annals of the New York
         Stage</em>, (New York: AMS Press, 1970), 8:580–581.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00185_n7">7. On , Ellen M. O'Connor
      melodramatically implored Whitman to see Mr. Howells, "and with all the skill
      and talent of which you are master do what you can to disenchant him with those
      people.…If he could but know the real truth in regard to 'the great head' and
      leader of the reform it would surely open his eyes. He evidently thinks Mr.
      A[ndrews] a 'great light' &amp; a saint of a man, sincere and true." Joseph
      Charles Howells, according to entries in New York Directories, must have been
      versatile (and perhaps eccentric): in 1864–1865 he was an "inventor," in
      1865–1866 an inspector in the Custom House, in 1866–1867 simply an
      "inspector," and in 1867–1868 a seller of hairpins.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00185_n8">8. Perhaps John A. Newbould,
      who, according to the Directory of 1863–1864, managed a hardware store in
      New York and lived in Brooklyn.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00185_n9">9. Stephen Pearl Andrews
      (1812–1886), an abolitionist and philosopher, was absorbed in utopian
      schemes to establish a universal language, to reconcile all great thought, to
      discover a science of the universe ("Universology"), and to institute a new
      social order which he called Pantarchy. Trowbridge related Whitman's adverse
      opinion of Andrews' schemes in <em>The Independent</em>, 55
      (1903): 497–501; note also R. A. Coleman, "Trowbridge and Whitman," <em>PMLA</em>, 63 (1948): 266, and E. C. Stedman's description of
      the "Pantarchial scheme" in <em>Life and Letters</em> (New York:
      Moffat, Yard and Co., 1910), 1:174–175. Ellen M. O'Connor voiced her
      distaste for Andrews in "Personal Recollections of Walt Whitman," <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, 99 (1907): 829.<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00185_n17">17. The affection of the
      O'Connors for Whitman was evident in Ellen's reply on : "Dear Walt, we long for you, William sighs for
      you, &amp; I feel as if a large part of myself were out of the city—I shall give
      you a good big kiss when you come, so depend upon it."<a href="#r17">[back]
