   <p>Your son Erastus Haskell,<sup><a href="#nyh.00001_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> of Co K 141st New York, is now lying sick with typhoid fever here in hospital.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been with him quite a good deal, from day to day, was with him yesterday &amp;
      indeed almost every day, &amp; feel much interested in the young man. He has been very
      sick, &amp; seems to be so now, as I should judge, but the doctor says he will recover.
      I had a talk with the doctor yesterday, &amp; he says so still. But Erastus seems to me
      very sick, &amp; I thought I would write to you. He had some one write to you about two
      weeks ago, but has received no answer.
   </p>
   
   <p>Erastus does not talk much, so I do not understand much about his affairs. I am merely
      a friend. The address of Erastus is
   </p>
   
   <p>Ward E, Armory Square Hospital | Washington D C</p>
   
   <p>should you wish to write to him direct.</p>

   <p>care Major Hapgood, paymaster | U S A cor 15th &amp; F st | Washington | D C</p>
   
   <p>Upon second thought I enclose you an envelope to send your letter to Erastus—put a
      stamp on it, &amp; write soon. I suppose you know he has been sick a great deal since
      he has been in the service.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyh.00001_n1">1. Whitman noted in his
      diary: "Rank musician—typhoid fever—I visited him from the time he was brought
      in the hospitals—he told me he had been sick off &amp; on for several months"
      (Charles I. Glicksberg, <em>Walt Whitman and the Civil War</em>
      [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1933], 148–149). See also
      his letters from 
       and 
      . On the verso of the
      letter is a pass, dated August 1, 1863, issued to Samuel B. Haskell for the
      purpose of visiting his son. The New-York Historical Society has a letter
      written by J. M. Jansen—like Erastus, a musician in the Hundred and Forty-first
      Regiment, New York Volunteers—on April 5, 1863, in which he informed Mr. Haskell
      that his son would surely receive "his discharge after a spel, so take things
      cool and dont borrow any trouble about him." Erastus added a note to Jansen's
      letter: "I am not doing any duty any where now, I havent been on duty since the
      20th day of December."<a href="#r1">[back]
