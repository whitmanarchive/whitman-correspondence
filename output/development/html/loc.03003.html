      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of Sept. 29, enclosing two more slips of the Preface came duly, but now
      that I am in office, &amp; have to leave at 8 A. M. &amp; don't get home till near
      or quite 5 P. M. I am so tired that I can't even touch a pen at night. I am in for
      two months, as the Census work is closing up in part. It has been a hard &amp; busy summer, &amp;
      that is why you did not hear from me. I had to work just as hard for the examination
      for this office, as for any, &amp; had to pass an examination, &amp; then work to
      get in.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So now with my moving, &amp;house-keeping, &amp; getting through with a day in the
      office, you can say that I am <u>busy</u>. Thank you again for the Preface. I am
      pleased with it, for I know you wrote <u>what you felt to
         write</u>. I know that you &amp; I feel more &amp; more a most tender &amp;
      growing love for dear William,<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; all his noble &amp;
      generous qualities show out to me by contrast, all the time. I don't find others
      like him, tho' I have nothing to complain of; &amp; have warm &amp; loyal friends.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I have a vivid picture of you, as you sit in your room. I Hope we shall have fine
      weather, &amp; that you will enjoy it.
   </p>
   
   <p>My sister Jeanine, Mrs. Channing, will be here before the month ends, I hope.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
