   </p>
   
   
   <p>I write merely to say that I have finished the article on <em>Democracy</em>; 
      (that will be its name.) I feel persuaded that it will please you thoroughly. 
      It will make thirteen pages in <em>Galaxy</em>—the arrangement that it appear as leader in December number, being of course carried
      out.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It will reach your hands by or before Monday next, 21st.
      
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00271_n1">1. William Conant Church
      (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
      York newspapers until he founded the <em>Army and Navy
         Journal</em> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
      he established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. Financial control of
      the <em>Galaxy</em> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
      was absorbed by the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1878. William
      published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
      Francis wrote for the New York <em>Sun</em> the unsigned piece
      "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." See Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the
      <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952),
