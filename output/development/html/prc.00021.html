   <p>I write a line to jog you about the proofs of <em>Personalism</em>. 
      Is it being put in type? For reasons as in former note, 
      I am anxious to have proofs as soon as possible.<sup><a href="#prc.00021_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00021_n2">1. William Conant Church
      (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
      York newspapers until he founded the <em>Army and Navy
         Journal</em> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
      he established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. Financial control of
      the <em>Galaxy</em> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
      was absorbed by the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1878. William
      published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
      Francis wrote for the New York <em>Sun</em> the unsigned piece
      "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." See Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the
      <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952),
      332–350; Donald N. Bigelow, <em>William Conant Church

      1952); J. R. Pearson, Jr., "Story of a Magazine: New York's <em>Galaxy</em>, 1866–1878," <em>Bulletin of the New York

   <p id="prc.00021_n1">2. Walt Whitman had sent the
      proofs with his  letter. On March 25,
      1868, William C. Church reported that Walt Whitman's second set of proofs had
      arrived too "late for us to make the corrections &amp; I return it so that you
      can transfer them to the proofs before sent" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
