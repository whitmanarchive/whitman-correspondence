   <p>I have now been a week in Canada enjoying every thing quietly but finely—I live
      much outdoors—go riding or some short jaunt or around the farm, most [

       day—I have a good
      room—good table [illegible]
      [
      <span class="unclear">plenty?</span>]
       of young folks (young ladies) &amp; a
      small army of fine children—a large, quiet library—but the best thing is
      my <u>hostess</u>, one of those blessed sisterly women I have had
      the good luck to meet in life's grim journey &amp; have for a friend, more than
      once—Canada is a far finer country than I supposed—very fair land, the
      people nicely
      off—I see none very poor—I remain well for me—am to go to Lake
      Huron next week for a few days, to return here of course—Harry dear boy, how
      are you? &amp; Mont<sup><a href="#n0910" id="r2">2</a></sup> and Van<sup><a href="#n0883" id="r3">3</a></sup> and Debby<sup><a href="#n0844" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Love to all—
