      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman Esqr<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.03259_n29" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      <br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p> 
   
   
   <p> I read with much pleasure, your interesting article: "Old Bowery"—with the
      reminiscencies of the actors &amp; actresses fifty years ago<sup><a href="#syr.00016_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Tho' I am not personally known to you—&amp;
      as far as my knowledge you to me—still every one tells me, I would assuredly
      know Walt Whitman the poet by description—your remarks about the elder
      Booth<sup><a href="#loc.05827_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> is true to the letter—no actor has ever
      approached him—in this Century—unless it be the Elder Kean<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—or the Kembles<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Tho' I am not yet an Octogenarian or even a Septuagenarian—I being
      but 66 at the close off this month—I date my theatrical experience  since 1835 just
      fifty years ago the year I came from England—then a mere youth, but as I was
      intimately acquainted with the Treasurer of the Park Theater under Price<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup>—I had the entreé at that theater at all times
      &amp; was &amp; was in theatrical parlance a "first nighter" referring back to Booth
      he was the genius of all the players—neither Macready<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup> nor Vandenoff<sup><a href="#n4107" id="r8">8</a></sup> (the elder) nor 
      Chas
      
       Kean<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n6" id="r9">9</a></sup> or Booth (his son) or Irving<sup><a href="#loc.03571_n5" id="r10">10</a></sup> could compare to him his acting was
      inspiration—none could equal him save perhaps Forrest<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n7" id="r11">11</a></sup> in two characters—Richilieu &amp; King
      Lear—his stentorian voice &amp; powerful frame which gave him perhaps an
      advantage over Booth but Forrest even in these characters was the perfection &amp;
      not the genius of acting—I never witnessed Forrest acting but the houses were
      jammed, my experience of witnessing Booth was not so fortunate as yours—I seldom
      saw him to big houses the last time I saw him was at the Chatham Square theater—a
      rather  pretty
      house for those times, built I think by Flynn of the old Bowery Theater<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n8" id="r12">12</a></sup>—I think he played Sir 
      Giles Overeach
      
       in a new way to pay old debts"—at all events it was where he has a
      servant named "Maral" I cannot remember without reference whether it was this piece
      or the "Iron Chest" both pieces besides all you name I saw him in—at this
      representation I speak of—he played to empty benches as far as memory
      serves—There could not have been fifty persons in the house—I was in the
      pit or what is now called the parquet—I never can forget his marvelous acting
      it was inspiration with him—one scene where he upbraids Maral he gives him a
      contemptuous look  &amp; utters with electrical effect "Maral I hate thee"—I can never forget
      it—it was imprinted in my mind ever since—if he was now alive few houses
      would hold the numbers that would flock to see him—I cannot account for the
      cause, why I never saw him to a crowded house—I presume his erratic career had
      something to do with [illegible]—while
      upon theatricals fifty years ago you perhaps did not witness scenes, which I
      did—memorable among which was the driving of Mr &amp; Mrs Wood<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n9" id="r13">13</a></sup> from the stage of the Park &amp; her reappearance at the
      same house by the almost unanimous need of the theater going Public—
   </p>
   
   <p>The driving of Mr &amp; Mrs Wood from the stage was the action of 
      Jas 
      
       Watson Webb then proprietor of the Courier &amp; Enquirer a gentleman in
      manners &amp; association<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n10" id="r14">14</a></sup> but he espoused the cause of
      a <u>Mrs</u> Conway &amp; got up this "Theatrical row" <u>I was there</u>—&amp; as I write I witnessed her
      reappearance at the same house after an absence of 2 3 or 4 years—The ovation
      was as great as the row—do you recollect this delightful singer no english
      singer could compare to her in this century—the Italians such as Grisi<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n11" id="r15">15</a></sup> or Titiens<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n12" id="r16">16</a></sup> had more
      musical science, but as a whole they were not better only Malibran<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n13" id="r17">17</a></sup> perhaps was her superior Mrs Wood sang in 
      Sonambula
      
       &amp; Norma—with equal effect &amp; gestures which neither Grisi or
      Titiens could 
      attempt Sonambula, you assuredly must have seen her in this part—can you ever forget
      the scene, where her lover upbraids her, for being formal in "his Lordships chamber"
      she was a charming singer—certainly no English singer of my time, can be
      compared to her, I think she is dead—but her husband is still living in
      England or it may be au contraire Mr. Wood was a very agreeable singer of the
      English school—not as sweet a singer or as good as Wilson—you must
      recollect the Shirreff troupe—who came out I think under Wallack Sr.
      management—Miss Shirreff Wilson the Seguins &amp; a charming Baritone 
      who
      
       name I cannot now remember  They came out in "Amelie" written
      by a young Irish composer named Rooke<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n14" id="r18">18</a></sup> a charming opera
      full of sweet melodies well harmonized—they took New York by storm—you
      must also recollect a very pretty chorus girl named Taylor—who was in the
      foremost of the
      choristers—she made quite a sensation<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n15" id="r19">19</a></sup>—&amp;
      was afterwards one of Mitchell principal actresses in his English burlesque
      company<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n16" id="r20">20</a></sup>—she subsequently married quite well
      then burlesques were very witty &amp; quite enjoyable—they outlived themselves
      however &amp; the Opera Bouffe<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n17" id="r21">21</a></sup> with reason 
      taken
      
       its place—particularly some of the later compositions, which are not
      offensive to good taste or ears polite  Then again do you recollect Signor
      de Begnis (—with perhaps the exception of Lablach<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n31" id="r22">22</a></sup>—whom I have heard
      frequently on my trips across the ocean)<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n18" id="r23">23</a></sup> he was the
      first Bouffe I ever heard—his voice was somewhat off when he came to this
      country, but he was a great singer—it was for he that Rossini wrote his Barber
      in the Barbiere di  
      Sivilgia
      
       as well as for Madame de Begnis<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n30" id="r24">24</a></sup>— a very good singer I believe for she
      was before my time—but a very bad immoral woman—they were playing the
      Turco in Italia at the old Church [illegible] Theater under De Begnis management the night it was burnt down  the site is now
      occupied by extensive dry goods store—poor de Begnis was heart broken—I
      knew him intimately—I recollect his coming down to the English chop house
      cor of Bway &amp; Leonard St a celebrated Caterer—an
      Englishman—but for the life of me I cannot recollect his name—well he
      came down perfectly crest fallen—deploring the destruction of the
      house—&amp; as he said for he spoke vile English that all his "Turkeys" was
      burnt up meaning that his turkish dresses were consumed—he was a character I
      assure you—but a great actor—As I say no one  was superior except Lablach &amp;
      none could approach him save perhaps Ronconi<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n19" id="r25">25</a></sup>—De
      Begnis died of yellow fever in [illegible]
      then you speak of Alboni<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n20" id="r26">26</a></sup>—I heard her both in New
      York &amp; this city she still lives in Paris—no one has ever approached her
      in voice or style—long previous to her however was Fanny Elssler
      who came over under the Chaperonage of Mr Wikoff<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n21" id="r27">27</a></sup>—she was a delightful dancer in her style what is
      called tour de force no one approached her—about her time there was a charming
      dancer Madame Augusta whose particular Role was in  the Bayadere—she drew crowds
      always<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n22" id="r28">28</a></sup>—you speak of Bettini Badiali<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n23" id="r29">29</a></sup>—I heard them with Madame Todesco<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n24" id="r30">30</a></sup> at the Old Chestnut theatre (about 35 years
      ago) to very poor houses price 50 cents pit boxes 1.00 They afterwards appeared at
      the Walnut—to better houses. Things have changed since the days of
      Hamblin—Scott &amp; maybe Kirby<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n25" id="r31">31</a></sup>—this style
      of acting would not suit any class of people now—the mob like a little rant
      &amp; loud declamation now—but it must be from pieces which are more
      sensational  in
      their character—as you will learn I have been a great theater goer in my
      time—I am getting a little in the "sere and yellow leaf"<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n32" id="r32">32</a></sup> now—but I still enjoy the
      play—&amp; most of all 
      Musical entertainments I have seen &amp; heard all the great artists
      of my time with only three notable exceptions Malibran Rubini<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n26" id="r33">33</a></sup> &amp; Paganini<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n27" id="r34">34</a></sup> still there
      are great Musical artists now. Patti<sup><a href="#loc.03259_n28" id="r35">35</a></sup> [

      called "Queen of the English Opera" in her day. She was briefly married to the
      tenor Joseph Wood (died 1863), whom she later divorced. Wood was accused of
      misbehaving towards a fellow actress by the name of Mrs. Conduit and not only
      refusing to take part in a benefit the latter organized but putting on a show of
      her own in direct competition with it. The affair ended with an angry mob
      storming the Park Theater and driving the Woods off stage. The destruction of
      the establishment itself was only averted when one of its managers (Edmund
      Simpson) promised to never let the couple appear on stage again.<a href="#r13">[back]

   <p id="loc.03259_n10">14. James Watson Webb
      (1802–1884) was an American diplomat, general, and newspaperman. After
      publicly denouncing singer Mary Ann Wood in his <em>Morning
         Courier</em> for her alledged misbehavior toward a fellow actress (Mrs.
      Conduit) whom his paper supported, he was challenged to a pistol duel by her
      husband. While the duel apparently never took place, Webb continuted to
      editorialize against the couple and played a major role in the Woods' flight
      from the United States. For more on the Wood affair, see Vera Brodsky Lawrence's
      <em>Strong on Music</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago
