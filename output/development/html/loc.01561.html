      <br></br><br></br>Alfred Pratt,
      
      <br></br>Dear boy &amp; Comrade,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been home to Brooklyn, N. Y. on a visit to my mother, but I am now back here
      again, 
      and am well as usual, and working in the same place. Your letter of August 15, 
      and the letter of Oct. 2, have both reached me, &amp; I was very glad to hear from you
      &amp; your folks, 
      &amp; to get such friendly letters. Dear boy, I should like much to pay you a visit, 
      &amp; to be with you 
      
      for a while, &amp; to become acquainted with your father &amp; mother—it would be a real comfort
      to me, 
      &amp; I am determined to come one of these days—I often think about it, &amp; about you too,
      
      dear friend, &amp; one of these days we will see each other again.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing very new in my affairs. I have had quite a pleas-ant summer, 
      &amp; now the fall is here—the past three weeks has been splendid weather here, both days
      &amp; nights—but to-day there is a heavy rain—looks as if it had set in for a long storm—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>—I am living at a boarding house, the same place where you come to see me, but new
      landlord 
      &amp; landlady<sup><a href="#loc.01561_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—472 M st.—it is quite pleasant—mostly young people, full of life &amp; gayety—then I
      go to my work at 9, &amp; leave at 3—so you see it is easy enough—In about three weeks
      more it will be lively times here in Washington, as Congress is to meet then, &amp; there
      will be some important questions brought up—but I take all these things very coolly—&amp;,
      since the war is over, dont allow myself to get excited—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You must write to me often as you can. I shall probably remain here this winter. I
      wish you to give my love to your father &amp; mother. They do not seem at all like strangers
      to me.
      
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>And now Alfred I must bid you farewell for the present, my loving boy &amp; comrade.—When
      you write, write to me about the farm, &amp; the farm-life, crops, horses, &amp;c. for I like
      to hear about such things too.
      
   </p>

   <p id="loc.01561_n2">1. Mr. and Mrs. Newton
      Benedict operated the boarding house after the death of Juliet Grayson on
      January 7, 1867. This change in ownership was first noted in Walt Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
