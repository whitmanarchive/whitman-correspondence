      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I feel as if this beautiful spring morning here in England must send you greetings
      through me. Our sunny little mound of garden, which runs down
      toward the south, is fragrant with hyacinths and wall-flowers (beautiful, tawny,
      reddish, yellow fellows laden with rich perfume)—and at the bottom is a big
      old cherry tree—one mass of snowy blossom; in a neighbour's gay garden &amp;
      beyond is a distant glimpse of some tall elms just putting on their first tender
      green: our little breakfast room where I always sit of a morning opens with glass
      doors into this garden. Herby is gone with the "Sunday Tramps,"
      of whom he is a member, for a ten or fifteen-mile walk. Said tramps are some half
      dozen friends &amp; neighbours, some of them very learned professors but genial good
      fellows withal, who agree to spend every other Sunday morning in taking one of their
      long walks together—&amp; a very good time they have. Giddy is gone to hear a lecture; our bonnie Scotch girl is roasting
      the beef for dinner, singing the while in the kitchen; and pussy &amp; I are sitting
      very companionable &amp; meditative in the little room before described.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You cannot think, dear friend, what a pleasure it was to have a whole big letter from
      you (not that I despise Postcards—they are good stop-gaps, but not the real
      thing). Yes, I have &amp; prize the article on the Hebrew Scriptures. How I wish you
      could make up your mind to spend your summer holiday with us.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still struggling along, striving to say something which, if I can say it to my
      mind, will be useful—will clear away a little of the rubbish that hides you from
      men's eyes. I hear the "Eminent Women Series" is having quite a
      large sale in America. Good-bye. Love to Mrs. Whitman. Greetings to your
      brother. Love from us all to you.
