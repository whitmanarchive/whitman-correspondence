      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n0705" id="r1">1</a></sup>,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, mother dear, I am certainly getting well again—I have made a great improvement
      the last three days, &amp; my head feels clear &amp; good nearly all the time—&amp;
      that, the doctor says, will bring my leg all right in a little while—Yesterday was
      a
      beautiful day, &amp; I was out a good deal—walked some, a couple of blocks, for the
      first time—Peter Doyle convoyed me—This morning I have had my breakfast, and
      have been sitting by my open window looking out—it is very pleasant &amp; warm, but
      cloudy—we have heavy showers here nights—too much rain indeed—still spring
      is very fine here, &amp; it looks beautiful from my windows—I am writing this in my
      room—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am feeling just now well as usual in my general health—part of the time, just as
      well as ever—but of course I expect a few set–backs before I get well entirely, &amp;
      supple in my limbs—It is remarkable how much paralysis there is—cases occur
      here, every few days—&amp; in other cities—There is quite a time here about the
      burial of Mr. Chase,<sup><a href="#uva.00366_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> his body is at the Capitol to–day, &amp; he
      is buried to–morrow—mother, the paper I send you has a picture of a railroad depot
      they are building here—it is for the road Peter Doyle works on—You will see a
      piece in that paper about the Beecher and Tilton scandal<sup><a href="#uva.00366_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—it is very coarse—I think Beecher a great humbug, but I don't believe there
      is any truth in that piece—(but of course don't know)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still having electricity applied—the doctor applied it yesterday—I am
      certainly getting along better the last few days—feel better—feel more like
      myself—I shall come &amp; pay you a visit the first part of next month—shall
      write before I come, the time, &amp;c—Mother, I hope this will find you feeling
      better—I shall be anxious to hear—write a line or two, Tuesday—As I sit by
      the window this forenoon looking out, I wish you could take a look at the prospect,
      it is so
      fine, the trees &amp; grass so green, and the river &amp; hills in the distance—it
      does one good to look at it—
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Mother, I shall feel anxious until I hear from you—
      <br></br>Walt.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="uva.00366_n1">2. The body of Salmon P. Chase, chief justice
      of the Supreme Court, was sent from New York to Washington on May 11, 1873, for
      funeral services.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00366_n2">3. Theodore Tilton (1835–1907), a
      protégé of Henry Ward Beecher, accused his mentor on December 30,
      1870, of improper relations with his wife. The accusation was suppressed by all
      parties until a sensational account of Beecher's relations with Tilton's family
      appeared on November 2, 1872, in <em>Woodhill and Claffin's
         Weekly</em>. Strangely, Beecher did not make a public denial until June 30,
      1873. After Tilton published in June 1874 a statement concerning Beecher's
      alleged misconduct, a committee from the minister's church examined the
      allegations and exonerated Beecher. On August 20, 1874, Tilton accused Beecher
      of adultery and asked $100,000 in damages. The trial lasted for six months and
      ended in a split verdict. In 1875 a committee of the Congregational churches
      found Beecher innocent.<a href="#r3">[back]
