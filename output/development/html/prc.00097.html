      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Would like to have say a four or five column article for the paper embodying the poems,
      &amp;c. of my new book "Two Rivulets," to publish say eight or ten days before their
      issue by me?—making a resume of the book in advance giving the principal pieces,
      (hitherto unpublished—&amp; to be first printed in said article.) If so, I will
      make out such an article &amp; send you, for your determination. The price would be
      $200.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have thought that as you like to have things in advance—&amp; also to give
      variety to the paper—such a proposition might be acceptable. If not, no harm
      done.
   </p>
