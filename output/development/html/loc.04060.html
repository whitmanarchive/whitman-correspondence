      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have had joyful news to-day! Percy's wife has a fine little boy—it was born on the
      10th, and Norah got through well &amp; is doing nicely; so I feel very happy.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Since then Per. has gone to Paris where he is to read a paper before the "Iron and
      Steel Institute" on the Elimination of phosphorus from Iron—which is also a little
      triumph of another kind for him—for the Council which accepted his paper is composed
      of eminent English scientists, &amp; eminent foreign ones will hear it.—I need not tell
      you it is indescribably lovely here now—no doubt Kirkwood is the same—the light so
      brilliant, and yet soft—the rich autumn tints just beginning to appear—the temperature
      delicious—crisp &amp; bracing, yet genial.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The throng of people is gone—but a few of the pleasantest of the old set remain—&amp;
      a few interesting new ones have come!—among them Mrs. Dexter from Boston, who was
      a Miss Tic[k]nor, daughter of the author of the book on Spanish literature—she and
      her husband full of interesting talk. Also Mr. Martin B—and his wife—a fine specimen
      of a leading Bostonian. Besides these also a physician from Florida whom I much admire—with
      a beautiful firm tenor voice—very handsome &amp; graceful too, a true southerner, I should
      say—(but of Scotch extraction).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Next week we go to Boston.</p>
   
   
   <p>I went over the Lunatic Asylum here the other day &amp; saw some strange, sad sights—some
      figures crouched down in attitudes of such profound dejection I shall never forget
      them—some very bright and talkative. It is said to be the best managed in America.
      Dr. Earle, who is at the head, is a man of splendid capacity for the post—a noble-looking
      old man (uncle of those Miss Chases you met at our house).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I can't settle to anything or think of any thing since I received Percy's letter but
      the baby &amp; Norah. Love to you &amp; to Mrs. Whitman &amp; Hattie &amp; Jessie.
   </p>

      Good-bye, dear Friend.
