      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend Abby,
      <br></br>and all my friends, Helen &amp; Emmy &amp; Mr. Arnold,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will write a line only—My paralysis still leaves me extremely feeble—&amp; with great
      distress in the head—<em>but I shall certainly recover</em>—mind just as clear as ever. I have lost my dear, dear sister Martha, in St. Louis—I
      appreciate your kind letter, Abby dear, and it is possible when I get better 
      it may be just the thing for me to come on a few days—but at present I can 
      hardly move ten steps without feeling sick—I am sitting here now in the 
      rocking chair in my room writing this—most of the time alone which 
      suits me best—it is paralysis of left side—Love to all—
   </p>
