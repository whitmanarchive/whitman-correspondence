      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am not overfond of letter-writing—rather hate it indeed—I am so
      overburdened with correspondence that I neglect half of it—nevertheless let me
      hope that I answered your last of September 14 '76—&amp; that it
      miscarried.<sup><a href="#tex.00358_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I am very glad to hear that you are so
      improved in health, that you move about the fields &amp; woods freely &amp; have
      enjoyment of your life.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As to myself I am pretty well for my time of life—sixty nine on the sixth of
      this month—but somewhat troubled about my eyes—for I am not only the
      shortest-sighted man in England—but have a great black island floating in each
      eye, &amp; these blacknesses increase with increasing years. However my oculist
      informs me that I shall not go blind, &amp; bids me as much as possible spare my
      eyes, neither reading nor writing too much.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My wife is still an invalid &amp; forced to lie on the sofa all day but still I trust
      somewhat stronger than when I last wrote to you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My younger son Lionel (whom you inquire about) was married to the daughter of F.
      Locker<sup><a href="#tex.00358_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> (the author of London Lyrics) in 
      Feby—the wedding was celebrated in our old grand historical Abbey of
      Westminster—there was a great attendance of literati &amp;c of all which I
      read an account in one of your New-York papers—every third word a lie!
      Trübner wrote to me this morning, stating that you wished to see a parody of
      yourself, which appeared among other parodies of modern authors in a paper called
      'The London'—I have it not or I would sent it you. Goodbye, good friend. I
      think I have answered all your questions.
