   <p>The contributions of Willie Durkee and my little girl are rather small but it takes
      all their spare funds for the week, and they are the only contributors thus far that
      will have to deny themselves anything on account of the amount of their contributions.

   <p>I hope to be able to make you another remittance this week.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Moses Lane was chief
      engineer in the Brooklyn Water Works. Like Jeff, he collected money from his
      employees and friends. Lane sent Whitman various sums which he acknowledged in
      letters. In his letter of , Lane
      pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in the Berg Collection,
      Whitman, wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum
      of money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York,
      (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted
      Whitman in other ways. He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal welfare that
      on , he sent through Jeff $5 "for
      your own especial benefit."
