      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am sending you a P.O. order for £10.<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r1">1</a></sup> Some of my friends want your books and are forwarding the money through me. I also
      want one or two copies to give away.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You had better, I think, send the books direct to the following:</p> 
   
   
   
   
   <p>Both vols (Leaves of Grass &amp; Two Rivulets) to <br><br>E. Seymer Thompson
      <br>Christ's College
      <br>Cambridge—ditto to 
      <br><br>Clement Templeton
      <br>Abernethy House
      <br>Mount Vernon
      <br>Hampstead
      <br>London
   </p>
   
   <p>One vol (Two Rivulets) to 
      <br><br>J. J. Harris Teall
      <br>University Extension Lecturer
      <br>Nottingham
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>The rest you had better send to me. But do not send them immediately. I will write
      again when I know my address at Sheffield (where I am going shortly), and when I know
      which volumes are wanted.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have not seen (or heard) anything of Buchanan<sup><a href="#n0117" id="r2">2</a></sup> since I have been in England: but I shall bear in mind your message if ever I come
      across 
      
      
      
      him. I looked at Augusta Webster's<sup><a href="#n0840" id="r3">3</a></sup> poems the other day at a library: but they seemed to me commonplace—rather inclining
      to be intellectual—and I don't think you would care about them. They were not miscellaneous
      poems, but one vol: a drama and the other a Chinese story. I have made enquiries but I can not hear of any other vol. If however by any chance you want to have one
      of these vols write &amp; 
      
      
      
      tell me and I will send it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had a letter from Arunachalaen—my Bengalese friend—whose photo: you have, not long
      ago. Speaking about you he says 'I have for some time been seriously thinking of writing
      to him to express my love &amp; reverence'. He also says 'Do send me a photograph of him.
      I know of no means of getting it. I want if possible also a big one that I could frame
      &amp; hang up'. I have sent him one of the small photographs that I 
      
      
      
      have.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>By the bye, I wish very much that you would not have that photograph on the fly leaf
      of Two Rivulets. I do not like it at all. I don't think it is like you. Could you
      not put, instead, the head of 1871, or that of 1872 (which I admire much)? I have
      been showing the photographs you gave me to my sister Dora<sup><a href="#n0842" id="r4">4</a></sup>—whose likeness you have. She is very much impressed with particularly 
      
      
      
      the last mentioned and wants to make a painting after it in oils. She is getting on
      finely I think and if I can get it I shall send you a photograph of one of her last—a
      couple of dogs, a pug and a King Charles.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am finishing up my preparations for my winter course of lectures. I have got a whole
      lot of apparatus down here to illustrate 'sound'—organ pipes 
      
      
      
      and tuning forks and speaking tubes and piano wires stretched on sound boards &amp;c—and
      am practising experiments on them much to the delight of a small nephew, who understands
      everything <u>at once</u>—in the most alarming way—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Remember me to Harry<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I would like to know what he is doing—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0141b">1. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0117">2. Robert Buchanan (1841–1901), Scottish poet and
      critic, had lauded Whitman in the <em>Broadway Annual</em> in
      1867, and in 1872 praised Whitman but attributed his poor reception in England
      to the sponsorship of William Michael Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne.
      See Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in England</em> (1934),
      79–80, and Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em>
      (1955), 445–446. Swinburne's recantation later in 1872 may be partly
      attributable to Buchanan's injudicious remarks. For more on Buchanan, see Philip
      W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_91.html">Buchanan, Robert (1841–1901)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0840">3. Augusta Webster (1837–1894)
      was a British poet, essayist, and translator, who published her first book of
      poetry (<em>Blanche Lisle, and other Poems</em>) under the pen
      name Cecil Home in 1860. For more, see Elizabeth Lee, "Webster, Augusta," in <em>Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900</em>
      60:115-16.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0842">4. Dora Carpenter was one of the six
      sisters of Edward Carpenter. She committed suicide in 1912.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0590">5. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
