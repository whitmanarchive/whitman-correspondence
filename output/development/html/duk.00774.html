   <p>The publisher having placed a few advance copies in paper of Dr Bucke's WW at my
      disposal I send you one<sup><a href="#duk.00774_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—The book will be 
      pub:
      
       here &amp; in London in 
      ab't
      
       ten days—May-be you could find a market (in some remunerative
      quarter) for some early notices of same—yours of 27th 
      rec'd—
   </p>
   
   <p>I don't think you appreciate the importance of that article of yours, (statement,
      position, signal for advance, &amp;c) in the <em>Critic</em>. It
      entails on you deep responsibilities, &amp; great wariness &amp; determination in
      keeping it up. I mean exactly what I said in my last.<sup><a href="#duk.00774_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00774_n1">1. Kennedy's review of
      Bucke's study appeared in the Boston <em>Globe</em> on June 10.
      Whitman sent "Press copies" to the Philadelphia <em>Press</em>, in
      which a review appeared on May 27; to <em>The Critic</em>, where
      it was reviewed on June 9; to the Boston <em>Herald</em> (to
      Sylvester Baxter), in which a review was printed on May 27; to the New York <em>Evening Post</em>; and to the New York <em>Tribune</em> (Notebook, Yale; and Bucke's Scrapbook, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection, Library of Congress, Washington D.C.). The Camden <em>County Courier</em> noticed the book on June 2, the New York <em>Times</em> on July 1 (see the letter from Whitman to William
      D. O'Connor of ), and <em>The Nation</em> on July 26 (see the letter from Whitman to
      O'Connor of ). Dowden published
      a review in <em>The Academy</em> on September 8 (see the letter
      from Whitman to John Burroughs of ).
      Of his book Bucke wrote to O'Connor on February 26: "I am glad to . . . go to
      battle in a good cause, but I am not exultant about it, I have made up my mind
      to be attacked in every conceivable way, to be called an idiot, a lunatic, and
      all the rest of it, and I am prepared to stand it all" (The Library of Congress,
      Washington D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
