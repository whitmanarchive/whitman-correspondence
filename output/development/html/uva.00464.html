      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter came to hand yesterday with the key of the trunk enclosed. In accordance
      with your request I met Peter Doyle at Milburn's after office and we proceeded to
      your room and made up
      the package as you directed, and Peter took it to the Adams Express office.
   </p>
   
   <p>The contents are, <u>Gray suit</u>, coat, vest &amp; <u>one</u> pair of pants. <u>Black overcoat</u>.
      <u>Black felt hat</u>. <u>Pair of Buckskin
         gloves</u>.
   </p>
   
   <p>You should receive them in good order to-day, as they were strongly enveloped &amp;
      plainly directed.
   </p>
   
   <p>Let me know if you get them all right. I return the key enclosed herewith. Let me
      know
      how you are as often as you can. You had but one pair of gray pants, at least that
      was
      all there was in that trunk.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
