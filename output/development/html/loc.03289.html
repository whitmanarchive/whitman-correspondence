      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Enclosed please find a check for $50 for the article in the November number of the
      North American Review on "Slang in America." This is the very highest rate that is
      paid for contributions, and exactly double what is paid for nine-tenths of the
      articles that appear in it. I trust it is satisfactory. When will you have your
      article on Lincoln ready? Mr. Rice<sup><a href="#loc.02206_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> is quite impatient
      for it.<sup><a href="#loc.03289_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> If any question of pay stands in the way won't
      you please state what you will ask for it, and then I shall have the matter off my
      mind. I wish you 
      would answer this letter to-day, as I am about to start on a two weeks' trip to the
      West. 
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Very truly yours,
      <br></br>James <u xmlns="">Redpath</u>
      <br></br>Walt Whitman, Esq.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Redpath (1833–1891),
      an antislavery activist, journalist, and longtime friend of Whitman, was the
      author of <em>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown</em> (Boston:
      Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the <em>New York
         Tribune</em> during the war, and the originator of the "Lyceum" lectures. He
      met Whitman in Boston in 1860 and remained an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 9
      vols., 3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp." Redpath became
      editor of <em>The North American Review</em> in November 1886. See
      also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins, 1926);

         Making of Nineteenth-Century America</em> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University
      Press, 2008); and J.R. LeMaster, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_46.html">Redpath, James [1833–1891]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
