      <br></br><br></br>Dear Harry
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The spirit moves me to scribble off a few lines to you—but I don't know why,
      for I have no news to tell &amp; nothing particular to write about any how. I
      returned to-day from a three days visit to my Quaker friends at
      Germantown—they have tip top horses &amp; carriage, &amp; we had good long
      drives Saturday afternoon &amp; Sunday towards evening after the rain—After
      supper, &amp; the things are removed, we all sit around the table we sometimes keep
      it up an hour &amp; a half &amp; have a good talk &amp; discussions, &amp; accounts
      of any thing that has occurred during the day, &amp; somebody has questions to put
      or information to glean,—perhaps some little recitation or singing, a good lot
      of us—eight or nine altogether—there are two just grown daughters, as
      nice and jolly and 'cute as young women can be—one son—&amp; always
      three or four others—making a good time  Sunday morning, they have family
      prayers—I was requested to read a chapter from the testament—(the Sermon
      on the Mount)—<u>which I did</u>—(I wish you could
      have all seen &amp; heard me)—I never beheld such a merry, affectionate,
      hearty healthy family—[
      <span class="unclear">nobby?</span>]
      , too—
   </p>
   
   <p>—With me, this fall, everything just floats idly along, as far as writing and work
      are
      concerned—Down there at Ocean Grove and along Barnegat &amp;c. I was moved to
      write a poem <u>on the ocean</u><sup><a href="#loc.03999_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I have turned it &amp; turned it &amp; rewritten it over &amp; over
      again—but cant get it to suit me yet—Harry, how is it with you? &amp;
      why 
      didnt
      
       you come &amp; tell me—before you left the printing offices
      here?—Write me a line soon as you get this<sup><a href="#loc.03999_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Sometimes I think you must be sick—
   </p>
   
   <p>—I am about as usual—I am writing this after 9 at night up in my room, sitting
      in the big 
      ratan
      
       chair.
   </p>
