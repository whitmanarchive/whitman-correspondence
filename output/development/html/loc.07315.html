   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07315_n2">3. "Mrs. B" is Bucke's wife,
      Jessie Maria (Gurd) Bucke (1839–1926), and "Clare" is the Buckes' daughter, Jessie
      Clare Bucke (1870–1943).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07315_n4">4. Richard "Dick" Flynn was a longtime assistant to Bucke at the London asylum, 
      doing odd jobs. Whitman met Flynn and admired his gardening work when he visited Bucke
      in 1880; he mentions 
      Flynn in his , letter to Thomas Nicholson. Traubel also records that Whitman was anticipating a
      visit from Flynn in Camden 
      shortly before Bucke wrote this letter (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.142.html">Tuesday, August 27, 1889</a>). Flynn, while on a tour of the U.S., apparently 
      stopped by Whitman's Mickle Street home and carried a copy of the Gutekunst photograph
      of 1889 back to London with him. Whitman had worried that the photo would get 
      damaged in the mail. Whitman and Bucke both greatly admired this photographic portrait,
      which is available in <em>The Walt Whitman's Archive</em>'s Gallery of Images.<a href="#r4">[back]
