      <br></br>Dear and great Poet,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Let me greet you. Happy New
      Year to you. Your poems have
      come to me anew<sup><a href="#loc.05962_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—here in
      Rome—and have revived
      and deepened my consciousness
      of great things, of beautiful
      things, of everything that lives.
      In writing to you at this 
      late time (for I knew your
      poems many years back)
      I do what I have often 
      wished to do.—Thank you.
      
      
      
      Christmas Day brought me a
      present of all your writings—original 
      editions—and hence
      this movement of admiration
      and love towards you.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is fine to have your words, 
      your brave sweet words, here
      where old Rome crumbles and
      new Rome grows; it is fine
      to have your visions of the 
      States, of men and women
      in our land, while I am
      close to the Coliseum,
      not far from the Pantheon
      and the Appian Way.
      I shall write. Your 
      poems are an Appian
      Way for the triumphal
      
      
      
      
      thoughts of the American, and you celebrate
      a theatre of action greater than Rome's
      Coliseum in celebrating our wide land.
      I shall hope for the chance to say publically
      what I now write to you. I have been
      several years in Rome. I have my studies
      here—for I am a painter. I trust that
      the time may come when, before this year
      has gone—I may have the pleasure
      of seeing you.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Eugene Benson (1839–1908) was

      to Italy. For more on Whitman's relationship with Benson, see Robert J.
