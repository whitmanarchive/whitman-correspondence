   <p>Thank you for the Magazine &amp; for the newspaper extracts, &amp; especially for the Memoranda
      of the Concord school. I have looked over all, &amp; thoroughly read a great part—(the
      "School of Athens" in the magazine,<sup><a href="#nyp.00413_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; the thoughts, &amp; statistics about the Mississippi River, &amp; about Chicago.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am better this fine morning—Should like to spend an hour in one of your public schools.</p>
