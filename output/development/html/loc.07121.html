   <p>Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r1">1</a></sup> has gone and I shall (do) miss him much—he is a
      thoroughly good fellow. We took him in to the 11.30 train this A.M. and he ought to
      reach Phila at 7 A.M. tomorrow. His visit was far too short but we had a good time
      while it lasted—make him tell you about our drive to Delaware
      yesterday—Horace, Dr. Sippi<sup><a href="#loc.07121_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>, P.E. Bucke<sup><a href="#loc.07121_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> and Self—we had a grand time. On our way to the
      station this morning I got from you a card (27th I guess)<sup><a href="#loc.07121_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—tell Horace I have not seen the Whitman piece mentoned in it and ask him to
      send it me—unless you send it yourself. Horace will tell you how we all are
      and what we are doing here. I have your card of 26th<sup><a href="#loc.07121_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      and Phila Press of same date (thanks for it) the little piece in
      it—"Whitman—Ingersoll—Death" might have been worse—but it
      also might have been a good deal better without being anything wonderful. Send and
      get "Brief for Plaintiff" Bacon vs. Shakespeare. 25e Rand &amp; McNally Chicago.<sup><a href="#loc.07121_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4267">1. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
