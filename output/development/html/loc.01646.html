      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete, 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing very new or different in my condition, or any thing else—have hardly been
      doing as well 
      since I last wrote, as before—but still hope to pull up.—Rec'd your letter last Monday,
      &amp; the <u>Herald</u>.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Not much of a letter this time, my loving boy—as I dont seem to be able to write much—though, as I sit here, I am not feeling any worse than
      usual. Ashton has lost his little child; 
      died last Thursday.<sup><a href="#loc.01646_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I have just rec'd two letters from Mrs. O'Connor. 
      How does all go with you? Pete, darling, shan't I send you a little money?
      
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
