   <p id="prc.00050_n1">1. Whitman was with the
      Staffords from June 25 to July 6 or 7 (<em>The Commonplace
         Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839â€“1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="prc.00050_n3">2. Joseph B. Marvin, one of
      Walt Whitman's Washington friends, visited Anne Gilchrist shortly after her
      arrival in Philadelphia in September, 1876 (Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist, <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em> [London: T.F.
      Unwin, 1887], 228). Marvin had been co-editor of <em>The
         Radical</em> in 1866-1867. Later he was employed in the Treasury Department
      in Washington. On , Marvin wrote
      to Whitman: "I read and re-read your poems, and the 'Vistas,' and more and more
      see that I had but a faint comprehension of them before. They surpass
      everything. All other books seem to me weak and unworthy my attention. I read,
      Sunday, to my wife, Longfellows verses on Summer, in the last Atlantic, and then
      I read your poem on the Death of Lincoln. It was like listening to a weak-voiced
      girl singing with piano 
      accompanyment
      
      , and then to an oratorio by the whole Handel Society, with 
      accompanyment
      
       by the Music Hall organ." Marvin's veneration of Whitman is also
      transparent in an article in <em>The Radical Review</em>, I
      (1877), 224-259.<a href="#r2">[back]

      "The Flight of the Eagle" in <em>Birds and Poets</em>. See the
