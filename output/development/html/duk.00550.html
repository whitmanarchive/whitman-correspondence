   <p>i
      have got
      your letter to day with the
      money order i have been
      down and got the money
      this time all was well)
      i dont  know as i should
      have gone down to day as
      it was election day but
      jeffy<sup><a href="#duk.00422_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      sent me a letter
      about 2 weeks ago with
      5 dollars in and i never
      received it i had a letter
      from him last week saying
      if i had not received
      it to go to the post office
      and enquire  i knew it
      would be of no use but
      i did ask simonson<sup><a href="#duk.00550_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> but
      it was the old story it
      never come here or you
      
      
      
      
      would have got it)
      it seems to be a fate on
      it every time Jeff sends
      me any money its stolen
      i wrote three letters to maty<sup><a href="#duk.00465_n9" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      thinking it so strange i
      got no answer but Jeff
      wrote last week that matty
      wasent  very well i suppose
      she has bad spells and
      then she gets better again)<sup><a href="#duk.00550_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      well walt i have had
      two letters from the honorable
      Mr Heyde<sup><a href="#duk.00550_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> well we wont 
      say any thing of the bad but
      tell of the good he says
      han received my letter
      with one dollar and she
      cant  get ready to come
      to brooklyn  till about
      christmas  that she drudges
      about that her thumb is
      very sensitive to the cold)<sup><a href="#duk.00550_n11" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      that the neighbors is very
      kind and sympathecic  when
      
      
      
      she was sick)
      then if he
      had stopped and not
      wrote any more the leter
      would have been quite
      acceptable but we let the
      balance go for what its 
      worth i was glad to hear
      from han even from him

      it and he would not get
      the coat untill  the next pay
      he is dooing  very well
      now but if Goodrich is

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00550_n14">1. This letter dates to
      November 2 or 3, 1868. Louisa dated the letter "November 2," and Richard Maurice
      Bucke assigned the year and the day of the week, "Monday." Edwin Haviland Miller
      also dated this letter November 2, 1868 (see <em>Faint Clews &amp;
         Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North
      Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 198–199; Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–75], 2:366). However, the letter refers to going to town on "election
      day," which does not match her date "November 2," because the election was held
      on Tuesday, November 3, 1868. The year is corroborated by the illness of
      neighbor Charley Mann, whose death is the subject of Louisa's  letter to Walt. As the date in
      Louisa's hand and election day are not compatible, the letter dates to November
      2 or 3, 1868.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00550_n1">3. Joseph Mosler Simonson (d.
      1879) was a chief clerk in the Brooklyn Post Office. After three or four letters
      in which money was sent went missing earlier during the year, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman had visited postmaster Simonson in his office (see her  letter to Walt). Simonson
      assured her of the Brooklyn office's honesty, a view that Walt contested in his
       reply to Louisa: "I know
      the Mr. Simonson you saw at the post office—he has been a sort of Deputy
      post master a good many years—Notwithstanding what he says, the Brooklyn
      p. o. has a very bad name, &amp; a great many money letters sent there never get
      to their destination." Also see "Funeral of an Old Official," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, July 7, 1879, 4.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00550_n3">5. Mattie Whitman returned to
      Brooklyn in mid-October 1868 for medical treatment and an extended visit. Jeff
      Whitman arrived in Brooklyn late November. Mattie visited Brooklyn physician A.
      D. Wilson, and Walt Whitman consulted about her condition with another
      physician, DeWitt C. Enos (see Walt's  letter to Jeff). Walt noted his own suspicion that Mattie had
      "possibilities of consumption."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00550_n4">6. Charles L. Heyde
      (1822–1892) a landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman
      (1823–190), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's second daughter, and they lived in
      Burlington, Vermont.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00550_n11">7. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde suffered from a thumb infection that led Doctor Samuel W. Thayer to lance
      her wrist in November 1868 and to amputate her thumb the following month (see
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's 
      letter to Walt Whitman; and see Charles L. Heyde's letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman, December 1868, Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman
         and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949],
      225–226).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">8. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00550_n17">9. In November 1868, coal was
      advertised in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> at a rate of $8.50
      or $9.50 per ton.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00550_n15">10. A man known only as Smith
      was George Washington Whitman's partner in building houses on speculation. Walt
      Whitman described Smith as "a natural builder and carpenter (practically and in
      effect) architect," and he advised John Burroughs that Smith was an "honest,
      conscientious, old-fashioned man, a man of family . . . . youngish middle age"
      (see Walt's  letter to John
      Burroughs). For more on George's housebuilding business, see Jerome M. Loving,
      ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> (Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00550_n6">11. William W. Goodrich ran for
      State Senator in the Second District on the Republican ticket in 1867. The <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> printed a detailed letter that
      accused Goodrich of attempting to intimidate the Brooklyn Water Board into
      purchasing overpriced fire hydrant couplings during a previous stint on the
      state legislature ("A Radical Republican on Mr. Goodrich's Nomination," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, October 23, 1867, 2). George
      Washington Whitman in late 1867 had begun to serve as a pipe inspector for Moses
      Lane of the Brooklyn Water Works.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00550_n7">12. Charley Mann died of a
      disease that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman identified as "diptheria [<em>sic</em>] croup" three days later (see her  letter to Walt Whitman).
      Diphtheria is a contagious disease characterized by acute infection of mucous
      membranes, primarily the throat and nasal passages. Croup, an infection of the
      throat and larynx, is characterized by a ringing or barking cough.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00550_n13">13. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      phonetic spelling "mobeal" refers to Mobile, Alabama. The "old lady" was
      probably the mother of neighbor Mary E. Mann, who had family in Alabama (also
      see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). The Mann family—though Louisa spelled the name "man"—lived
      downstairs from Louisa. Also see Mary E. Mann's  letter to Louisa (Library of Congress).<a href="#r13">[back]
