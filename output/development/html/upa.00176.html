   <p>I jaunted down here last evening, to spend a couple of days. I think of being over
      with you (in all probability) Sunday next, say to dinner about 2.

   <p>I am feeling about as usual.</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00176_n1">1. The year is established
      by the reference to Whitman's visit to the Staffords on January 18, 1877.
      Whitman did not return on January 21, Sunday, but he was with the Gilchrists on
      the following Sunday (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
