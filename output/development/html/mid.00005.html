   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07761_n3">2. <em>Giordano Bruno: Philosopher and Martyr</em> (1890) consisted of two
      speeches before the Philadelphia Contemporary Club by Daniel G. Brinton
      (1837-1899), a pioneer in the study of anthropology, and by Thomas Davidson. It
      included a prefatory note by Whitman dated 24 February 1890 (see <em>The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman: Prose Works 1892</em>,
      ed. by Floyd Stovall, 2 vols. (1963-1964), 676-677). In his essay Brinton links
      the poet with Bruno in his rejection of the "Christian notion of sin as a
      positive entity" (34). On April 4, Whitman sent copies of the book to Symonds,
      Tennyson, Sarrazin, Rolleston, and W. M. Rossetti (<em>The
         Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839-1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). See also Whitman's
       letter to Bucke. After the poet
      presented him with a copy of <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em>,
      Brinton expressed his thanks effusively on .<a href="#r2">[back]

      lecture in New York in 1879 and would deliver it at least eight other times over
      the succeeding years, delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He had
      published a version of the lecture as "Death of Abraham Lincoln" in <em>Specimen Days</em> (1882-83). For more on the lecture, see
