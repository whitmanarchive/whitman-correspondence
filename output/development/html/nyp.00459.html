   <p>Yours 
      rec'd—yes indeed it is a cheering &amp; very important victory<sup><a href="#nyp.00459_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—most important coming just at this nick of
      time—vivifies Rees Welsh much (as I saw yesterday) &amp; gives an absolute
      cement to what perhaps was not so entirely <em>set</em> as I could
      have wished—though as I get along with them, &amp; versed, I am well satisfied
      with R W &amp; Co. and my prospect with them—Though Thursday &amp; Friday last
      were pretty dark, big clouds, big enemies on the horizon, some bad letters sent them
      threats from the "Society," they did not flinch but went on getting out the new
      edition as fast as possible—<em>Now</em> of course they feel
      entrenched &amp; good heart<sup><a href="#nyp.00459_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—The printing is done
      at Sherman &amp; Co's.

       7th &amp; Cherry, the best printing office in
      Philadelphia. My L of G plates having been sent on there from Rand &amp; Avery's,
      Boston—&amp; I shall begin on "Specimen Days" there in about a week—

       emerged from the house to-day, (it is July heat, oppressive)—but I
      shouldn't wonder if <em>the L of G. officially ordered to pass
         unmolested through the mails</em> was itemized generally over the land
      everywhere to-day, as the Telegraphic Associated Press chargé here in 
      Phila
      
      
      told me yesterday afternoon he intended to send it generally—the 
      Phila:
      
       <em>Press</em> here is very friendly—it has three short pieces
      in to-day, a first-rate 
      acc't
      
       of the P O Dept. decision &amp; commending it
      editorially—Talcott Williams<sup><a href="#nyp.00459_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> on the P[ress] is an
      ardent friend—
   </p>
   
   <p>William, I wish you would get an authentic copy of the P. O. letter order &amp; send
      me <em>soon</em>, if you can—When you see Col. Ingersoll say he
      
      dont
      
       know how deeply he has served me, &amp; at a time when it told best—

   <p id="nyp.00459_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd July 10/82 | [Answ'd July] 12 [82]." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor |
      Life Saving Service Bureau | Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Camden | Jul |

   <p id="nyp.00459_n2">2. On July 7 O'Connor wrote
      jubilantly: "The Boston Postmaster's action on Chainey's lecture is reversed and
      disapproved! Furthermore in the letter to Tobey, the Postmaster General takes
      the ground <em>that your book must pass unmolested through the
         mails</em>—that a book, generally accepted by the public, admitted
      into libraries, and accepted by the literary class, cannot be brought under the
      operation of the statutes respecting taboo matter. This is cheering. We owe this
      victory to the tact, bonhomie, energy and gallantry of Ingersoll, who put the
      case to the Department in the best manner possible" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection, Library of Congress, Washington D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00459_n3">3. On  Rees Welsh &amp; Co. wrote to Whitman: "Much
      to our surprise are threatened with an action. Please call at your earliest
      convenience and we will talk over it."<a href="#r3">[back]

      (1849–1928), a journalist, worked for the New York <em>Sun</em> and <em>World</em>, and became an editorial writer
      on the Springfield <em>Republican</em> in 1879. He joined the
      staff of the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in 1881. In 1912 he
      became director of the School of Journalism at Columbia University. See also
      Elizabeth Dunbar's <em>Talcott Williams: Gentleman of the Fourth
         Estate</em> (1936) and Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906), 1:202. The Philadelphia <em>Press</em> vigorously supported the poet against the Boston
      censorship both in its news columns and in its editorials. A front-page story on
      July 15 quoted at length the defense of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      offered by the Reverend James Morrow, "a prominent Methodist."For more
