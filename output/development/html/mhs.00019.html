   </p>
   
   <p>I am back here in New York, stopping for a couple of days at this hotel<sup><a href="#mhs.00019_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—as Dr Bucke &amp; his sister<sup><a href="#mhs.00019_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> are here (she is in poor health, &amp; they are here to
      consult a special physician)—we wanted to be together till Monday or Tuesday,
      when they start back for Canada—Then I shall go up &amp; stay with Mr &amp;
      Mrs Johnston<sup><a href="#mhs.00019_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—so if you write (&amp; I wish you
      would soon after getting this—have you seen Eddy?) direct to me <u>Mott avenue &amp; 149th street—Station L, New York City</u>
      (same as before I went on to Boston)—I 
      havn't
      
       heard
      
      
      from you all now in a
      fortnight—
   </p>
   
   <p>I came on yesterday from Boston<sup><a href="#mhs.00019_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—As I told you in my
      last every thing went on there satisfactory<sup><a href="#mhs.00019_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—&amp;
      my treatment from Osgood has been of the best—the prospect for the book (sales
      &amp;c) seems to be fair—there are already quite a number of orders—it
      is all ready, &amp; will be delivered &amp; for sale 4th Nov.—There will come
      a box (or bundle) by express to me probably to-day or to-morrow from Osgood,
      contains some of the books—Lou dear you open &amp; take one out for yourself,
      as I suppose you would like to see how it looks—leave the bundle tied up in
      the dark stout paper, as it contains only some MSS and stuff—also there may
      come a roll of printed matter for me, to be put up in my room—it will be
      directed to you "for W W"—(as any thing directed to <u>me</u>
      is liable to be forwarded here from Camden p o)—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am well as usual—I shall stay here in N Y ten or twelve days &amp; then home
      for a while<sup><a href="#mhs.00019_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—Lou I expect to spend a good part of
      the winter up in London, as I quite like it, &amp; they have great plenty of room,
      grub, servants &amp; every thing—I am enjoying the day &amp; time (Sunday
      forenoon) here at this big hotel—&amp; it is a <u>rouser</u>,
      (as you will see by the picture)—Dr B. and the Sister have gone over to church
      to Brooklyn to hear Beecher<sup><a href="#mhs.00019_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—&amp; I have been
      &amp; am having a good nice time sitting here by myself reading the Sunday <u>Tribune</u>,
      &amp; writing this &amp; one or two more letters—affectionately—
   </p>

   </p>
   
   
   <p>—The books are <u>for sale</u> to any that want them—price
      $2—I will drop you a line a day or two before I come back

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="mhs.00019_n1">1. This letter was written
      on the stationery of the Grand Union Hotel, which was opposite the Grand Central
      Depot, between Forty-first and Forty-second Streets at Fourth Avenue.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="mhs.00019_n3">3. Apparently Whitman
      changed his mind later in the day, since, according to Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, he was at the Johnstons' on October 24 and 25.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="mhs.00019_n4">4. During Whitman's last
      weeks in Boston he had entertained himself to his own satisfaction. On October
      11, accompanied by Baxter, he attended a performance of <em>Romeo
         and Juliet</em> starring Ernesto Rossi, the Italian actor who was on an
      American tour (Whitman's Commonplace Book). On October 15 he held open house at
      Mrs. Moffitt's boarding house for the pressmen and friends. According to the
      report, undoubtedly written by Whitman, in the Boston <em>Daily
         Advertiser</em> on October 17, there were three hundred visitors. See also

      November 3 (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r6">[back]
