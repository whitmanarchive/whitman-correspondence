   <p>Your kind letter of Dec. 23, with the £81 over, has safely reached me.<sup><a href="#uva.00515_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> I thank you, dear <em>Pall Mall
         Gazette</em>, &amp; deeply thank the donors of the
      gift<sup><a href="#uva.00515_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—It is accepted, I am sure, in the same
      spirit in which it is conveyed—And I must add that (while I am not at all in
      actual want, and have generous and attentive friends here) a money aid like this
      comes most opportunely to me under the circumstances, and helps "keep the wolf from
      the door" indeed.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am almost entirely physically disabled, but remain in good spirits and fairish
      health. Almost every week I write a little for pay and publication. Winter is at its
      height and bitter cold here now, the earth hard and covered with ice and snow, as
      I
      sit by my window well blanketed, writing this offhand letter of acknowledgement.
   </p>
   
   <p>God bless my British friends assisters—(from the first they have come in when
      most wanted)—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sir Henry Norman
      (1858–1939) was a writer and liberal politican from England. After moving
      to the United States to study at Harvard, he wrote for the <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> and the <em>News
         Chronicle</em>.

   <p id="uva.00515_n1">2. According to Whitman's
      Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) the amount was
      £81.6.6 ($393.61), which Walt Whitman deposited in the bank on January 11.
      Norman was acting for the editor of the newspaper, William T. Stead (1849-1912);
      see <em>American Literature</em>, XXXIII (1961), 68-69, and also
      the letter from Whitman to William T. Stead, . On  Norman protested to
      Whitman the citation in the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> of the
      names of three donors: Sir Edward Malet, the English ambassador in Berlin; Lord
      Ronald Gower; and A. Gerstenberg. <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em>
      devoted a great deal of space to Whitman in 1887: January 10, excerpts from "My
      Book and I"; January 20, lengthy extracts from "A Word about Tennyson"; April
      27, a quotation from Whitman's "Additional Note" for the English edition of <em>Specimen Days</em>; May 6, an excerpt from a private
      correspondent about gifts of Americans to Walt Whitman (see 1597); June 2, an
      account of Walt Whitman's birthday with quotations from the Daily News; July 9,
      "The Dying Veteran"; July 30, a summary of Swinburne's attack upon Walt Whitman;
      August 3, 4, 6, and 11, comment, editorial and personal, on Swinburne's article;
      September 6, a defense of the American poet. In addition, letters from Walt
      Whitman were reproduced on January 25 and August 30 (see the letter from Whitman
      to Stead of ). The endorsement of
      the draft letter (Clifton Waller Barrett Literary Manuscripts Collection,
      University of Virginia) reads: "Sent to Henry Norman | Pall Mall Gazette |
      London | Jan 3 '87."<a href="#r2">[back]
