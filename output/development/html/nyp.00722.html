      November 15, 1888. He spoke of his review in letters to Whitman dated  and . Whitman commented to Horace Traubel: "The
      Transcript piece has as a trifle a certain air almost of apology: but for that
      feature I like it. We are forcing the enemy to listen to us" (see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.17.html">Saturday, November 17, 1888</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
