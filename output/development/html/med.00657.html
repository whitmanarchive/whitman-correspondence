   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00657_n1">1. The summary of the letter
      is drawn from Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931),
      246. The location of this manuscript is presently unknown. The letter must have
      been written shortly after Whitman left Ocean Grove on October 10 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/days/anc.00219.html"><em>The Scottish Review</em></a> discussed <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, <em>Specimen Days and
         Collect</em>, Rossetti's 1868 selection <em>Poems of Walt
         Whitman</em>, Burroughs's <em>Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet
         and Person</em>, and Bucke's biographical study <em>Walt
         Whitman</em>. In "A Salt Breeze," in <em>Outing and the
         Wheelman</em> 3 (January 1884), 275–279, Burroughs referred to Whitman
      as a poet of the sea.<a href="#r1">[back]
