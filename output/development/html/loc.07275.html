   <p>It is a stupid, dull, dark, sulky day—ground white with snow but nothing
      approaching sleighing. A mixture of mud &amp; snow (the worst possible mixture). But
      I have a good fire in my office, have just had a good dinner of roast turkey and
      potatoes boiled in their jackets, (which is the only way a potato should ever be
      cooked), and have a very middling book to read (Obiter Dicta, 2d Series, Augustine
      Birrell),<sup><a href="#loc.07275_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> so I feel that I
      can defy the Pope the Devil and the Pretender—(an old expression of my father's). In fact I am
      feeling first rate "and hope these few lines will find you enjoying the same
      blessing"—seriously I trust all is going well with you—and with the big
      book<sup><a href="#n6137" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I hope to get my <u>unbound</u> copy of that early
      this week. There is nothing further from Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r4">4</a></sup> and I feel my
      patience wearing thin again—all quiet and going well at the asylum—it is
      a year <u>today</u> since our fire—hope it will be a good
      many untill the <u>next</u>—I had a proof<sup><a href="#loc.07275_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> of my report from Toronto last week to correct it will
      not be published untill the house meets abt 10th January,
      shall send it to you then—it is quite elaborate—Remember me to Mrs
      Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r6">6</a></sup> and Ed. Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r7">7</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4284">4. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
