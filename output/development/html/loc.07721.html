      New York is to have a monument to Goethe. It is to be erected in Central Park, at
      an expense
      of $30,000. The sculptor is Henry Baerer, who designed the Beethoven monument in New
      York
      and the John Howard Payne statue in Brooklyn. The Goethe monument is to be twenty-four
      feet high, with a colossal bronze
      figure of the great German poet at the summit, and four lifesize sitting groups in
      bronze around the granite
      pedestal, viz., "Faust and Margaret," "Iphigenia and Orestes," "Hermann and Dorothea
      at the Well," "The Harpist and Mignon."
      The cost will be defrayed by the students and admirers of Goethe, with the cooperation
      of the Goethe Society.</span><br><br>

   EMIN BEY AND HIS WORK
   
   <br><br><span class="indent"> </span><span class="handshift">
      In person, Emin is a slender man, of medium height, and tough and wiry figure. He
      is swarthy,
      with black eyes and hair. His face is that of a studious professional man, and that
      impression is heightened
      by the glasses which he always wears. His attitudes and movements are, however, very
      alert. He stands erect and with his heels
      together, as if he had been trained as a soldier. He was always reticent about himself,
      and his history
      was knownt ot no one in the Soudan or the Provinces of the Equator. He was supposed
      to be a Mohammedan. I am not sure
      that he ever said that he was, but I am quite sure that he did not deny it when I
      knew him. I thas become known later
      that he is a German, of university education; but there were many at that time who
      thought that he was a Turk of extraordinary
      acquirements. He is certiany a man of great ability in many ways, and of strong character.
      Just why such a man should have gone where he has and stayed there is
      hard to see. Probably it was largely force of circumstances and a spirit of adventure.
      Certianly when he went there there was no prospect of much
      pay or distinction, and he was actuated by no great philanthropic ardor. Responsibilities
      gradnually came upon him, and he rose to them.
      It is easy to see how, in a character like Emin's—sympathetic, reflective and enthusiastic—noble
      purposes were developed
      with a noble example before him and great opportunities around him. Emin's uncertain
      power in a savage land is all tha remains of the late khedive's 
      central African Empire.</span><br><br>

   <p>I am immensely pleased (tickled) with the result of my little Wifekin Dame Kennedy's
      visit to
      you. She has read yr books &amp; Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r11">11</a></sup> ever since she has
      returned. She was <u>finally</u> converted by the impression made
      by your personal presence. Says she felt that strange thrill (caused by yr great
      magnetism) that so many others have felt. She wrote to=day a tremendous arraingment
      of the Leslie Nutter I told you of. She hauled him over the coals finely. I rubbed
      my hands in glee after quoting some of the good great fellows (in England &amp;
      America) who stand up for W. W. &amp; love him she says, "Thoreau<sup><a href="#hun.00052_n3" id="r12">12</a></sup> thinks he is a great fellow, &amp; I think so, too." She says, "I saw
      with my own eyes, his nobility &amp; manners," &amp;c. She thoroughly understands and
      approves yr Children of Adam poems, too! Sees their noble purpose.
   </p>
   
   <p>She doesn't <u>need</u> you so much as I did, though, for she has
      always been a liberated spirit. Her father &amp; grandfather were deists.
   </p>
   
   <p>I tell you she's a rare little soul, I wish you knew how keenly she pierces to the
      heart of shams &amp; humbugs.
      Yet generous enough to forgive everybody. Tears spring to her eyes at the recital
      of
      some noble heroic deed. All unfortunates flock to her.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0368">2. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842–1892), called
      "Loo" or "Lou," married Walt's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
      son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
      son was stillborn. Walt lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
      1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
      Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Walt had a warm relationship
      during the poet's final decades. For more, see Karen Wolfe, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_109.html">Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="loc.00668_n4">3. Frederick Warren Fritzinger
      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,

      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel (1856–1914), was
      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

      Thomas Biggs Harned, <em>Memoirs of Thomas B. Harned, Walt

   <p id="n4267">6. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert

      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
