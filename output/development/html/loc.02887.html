   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received the paper &amp; enclosed slip Saturday week—filling me so full of
      emotion I could not write—for I am too bitterly impatient of mere words. Soon,
      very soon I come my darling. I am not lingering, but held yet a little while by the
      firm grip of conscience—this is the last spring we shall be asunder—O I
      passionately believe there are years in store for us—  years of tranquil, tender
      happiness—me making your outward life serene &amp; sweet—you making my
      inward life so rich—me learning, growing, loving—we shedding benign
      influences round us out of our happiness and fulfilled life—Hold on but a
      little longer for me my Walt—I am straining every nerve to hasten the
      day—I have enough for us all—with the simple, unpretending ways we both
      love best. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Percy is battling slowly  doing as well as we could expect in the
      time. I think he will soon build the nest for his mate. I think he never in his
      heart believed I really should go to America and so it comes as a great blow to him
      now. You must be very indulgent towards him for my sake dear Friend.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am glad we know about those rascally book agents—for many of us are  wanting a goodish
      number of copies of the new edition &amp; it is important to understand we may have
      them straight from you—Rossetti is making a
      list of the friends &amp; the number, so that they may all come together—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Perhaps dearest friend you may be having a great difficulty in getting the books out
      for want of funds—if so let me help a little—show your trust in me and
      my love thus generously.
   </p>

      Your own loving
      <br></br>Annie.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
