      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Jeff,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you rec'd the letter<sup><a href="#mhs.00027_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> I wrote four or five days ago from Providence, R. I. 
      I came back Thursday night, &amp; was over home on Friday. I received your letter. 
      Matty has had an examination of her lungs,<sup><a href="#mhs.00027_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> by Dr. A. D. Wilson, 30 Gates Av. 
      near Clinton av. I had not seen Dr. W.—it was the Thursday before I returned—yesterday
      I went down to see Dr. Enos,<sup><a href="#mhs.00027_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> waited some time, but did not see him—I intended to make an appointment, &amp; go down
      with Mat but, as I say, came away 
      without seeing him—Then I went up to Gates av. &amp; found Dr. Wilson in, &amp; had a 
      long talk with him about Mat. The impression he made upon me was that he is a 
      man who knows his business thoroughly, very candid, &amp; probably a little disposed 
      to state things on the most unfavorable side, rather than the other—He said he could
      tell better in ten or twelve days—one of Mat's lungs is affected—thinks there is no
      imminent danger at all—thinks that the physician in St. Louis 
      who advised a change from there here, couldn't have had any knowledge of Brooklyn
      
      climate or situation—nevertheless thinks that the journey &amp; a temporary change 
      will be very salutary, &amp; do her good—advised whiskey, wine, condensed milk, &amp;c—did
      not advise any drug medicines—was evidently interested, &amp; took hold of the 
      case not merely as a matter of business—After seeing him &amp; talking [to] him, 
      I abandoned the idea of consulting Enos—at least for the present.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My idea is that Matty has the possibilities of consumption in her system—but that
      with ordinary good luck, she can &amp; will get over it. She has good spirits, 
      is very comfortably situated—has a good, cheerfull, warm room, with southern exposure—has
      a good stove, gas, &amp;c—Upon the whole, as to personal surroundings, &amp;c 
      she could not be happier in them—for Mother, &amp; George, &amp; Ed too, think &amp; do 
      every thing that the tenderest mother &amp; brothers could—George is very kind—Mat realizes
      it all perfectly, &amp; is herself very kind &amp; affectionate as indeed she always was.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother &amp; all wish you to arrange without fail to come on, on or before 1st December<sup><a href="#mhs.00027_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>—before, 
      if convenient—Mother is well, but shows her old age more &amp; more. I return to Washington
      to-morrow, 
      as my leave is up. The little girls are hearty as ever. Best love—
   </p>

   <p>It is certain that her cough is not near as bad here as it was in St. Louis, in that
      house.<sup><a href="#mhs.00027_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup>

   <p id="mhs.00027_n3">2. Martha Whitman's
      condition (mentioned in Walt Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman as "some cough") had not
      improved. On September 6, 1868, Jeff had informed George Washington Whitman that
      her doctor had recommended "a visit east," and on September 8, 1868, he wrote:
      "The doctors all unite in declaring that Mat has no disease of the
      lungs—it is all in the bronchial tubes of the throat" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). She remained in Brooklyn until the middle of December. By the
      writing of Walt Whitman's  letter
      to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, Martha's condition had not improved.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="mhs.00027_n5">4. Jeff arrived in Brooklyn
      about November 20, 1868; Walt Whitman inquired about Jeff's arrival in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor

   <p id="mhs.00027_n6">5. To George on September 8,
      1868, Jeff had complained that "the house is damp and I cannot seem to better
      it. I have spent abt $125 on it trying to fix it" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r5">[back]
