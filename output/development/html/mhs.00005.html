   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
