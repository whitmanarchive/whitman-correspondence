      <br></br><br></br>My dear Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I received your beautiful gift yesterday afternoon just in time for Xmas, and I
      cannot express how much it pleases me. Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r1">1</a></sup> brought it in to
      the Herald office for me and I was very sorry to be out at the time, for I have not
      seen him for some months, having been in Europe most of the Autumn. The book is a
      noble one<sup><a href="#loc.07104_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—a form 
      worthy of its contents, and to me, as to many, it will be an inestimable treasure.
      I
      think the friendly touches your hands have given it bestow an influence, real though
      impalpable, which may make itself felt more strongly than might be imagined by most
      men.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is interesting and instructive to me to watch the development of our dear
      country on the prophetic lines that your "Democratic Vistas" indicate. Evolutionary
      processes are rapid at certain stages, and bit by bit one may detect, if his eyes
      be
      clear,  the realization
      and the budding promises of realization—and in this sense even the black
      clouds are welcome for the sake of the clearer skies that follow.
   </p>
   
   <p>If you do any reading now a days you will find Edward Bellamy's <sup><a href="#n4272" id="r3">3</a></sup> "Looking Backward" a
      noble work, and delightful as well. It has made a profound impression and will do
      much towards realizing a grander future for our land.
   </p>
   
   <p>I enclose a photograph of myself with wishes that  the New Year may be kind to you.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3039">1. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
