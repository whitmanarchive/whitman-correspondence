   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      Actually the gift came from Carpenter and the Ford sisters (see the letter from
      Whitman to Carpenter of ). Bessie
      (d. 1919) and Isabella (1855–1924) Ford were sisters who lived together in
      Leeds. They were friends and disciples (as well as cousins) of Carpenter, and
      active social reformers, working for women's suffrage, trade unionism, and an
      independent labor party.<a href="#r3">[back]
