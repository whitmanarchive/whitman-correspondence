      Gray was a captain in the Twentieth New York Infantry and later held the same
      rank in the Assistant Adjutant General's Volunteers. He became a major on
      January 4, 1865, and resigned on December 6 of the same year; see Francis B.
      Heitman, <em>Historical Register and Dictionary of the United
         States Army</em>, 2 vols. (Washington D.C.: Government Publications Office,
      1903). In 1862 he fought in the battle at Antietam, and at Charles Pfaff's beer
      cellar located in lower Manhattan, he gave Whitman "a fearful account of the
      battlefield at Â½ past 9 the night following the engagement." (For discussion of
      Whitman's activity at Pfaff's, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/walt_whitman/index.html#bohemian">The Bohemian Years</a>.") In 1864, according to one of Whitman's
      notebooks (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of
      Congress, Notebook #103), Gray was stationed at New Orleans. He graduated from
      the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York in 1871, and briefly
      practiced medicine with his father in New York. Whitman referred to him during
      this period in a notebook (The Library of Congress, Notebook #109). Later he
      practiced in Paris, Nice, and Geneva. He died of Bright's disease at St. Clair
      Springs, Michigan, on April 18, 1891; obituaries appeared in the <em>New York Herald</em> and the <em>New York
         Tribune</em> on August 19, 1891.
