   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00866_n1">1. Traubel records the contents
      and aims of the letter: "The slip was about five inches solid of Herald print.
      The True Need of Fiction was the subject. Asked in effect: 'Shall we sound the
      alarm or ring the jubilee' over the prevailing tendencies of fiction?" See
      Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.57.html">Monday, March 18, 1889</a>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00866_n2">2. See also the letter from
      Frank H. Williams to Whitman on .
      Apparently, Walsh's request for the poet's assessment of the "prevailing
      tendencies" in current fiction, co-signed with James Gordon Bennett of the New
      York <em>Herald</em>, prompted a discussion with Williams about
      the distinction between mere sensationalism and progressive attitudes toward sex
      in literature. Traubel records Whitman saying: "No one would more rigidly keep
      in mind the difference between the simply erotic, the merely lascivious, and
      what is frank, free, modern, in sexual behaviour, than I would" (Horace Traubel,
      <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.59.html">Wednesday, March 20, 1889</a>).<a href="#r2">[back]
