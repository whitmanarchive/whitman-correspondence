      <br></br><br></br>My dear Friend
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You see I venture to salute you,<sup><a href="#n0905" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; to write to you in the same strain as that in
      which you so kindly addressed me in your letter of 26 May, &amp; which I was 
      vy
      
       glad to receive. I <u>did</u> get your Riddle Song,<sup><a href="#man.00035_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      &amp; was very pleased indeed to have it, &amp; now I have your tribute to Emerson,
      which is exceedingly interesting. It is pleasant to see you all rallying round the
      grand old man of letters, but more than of letters.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Alfred Tennyson<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r3">3</a></sup> left England about a week ago, for Venice, &amp;
      he will probably be absent for a month or more. but he shall have the paper on
      Emerson, &amp; anything else you forward me, [
      <span class="unclear">directly?</span>]
       he returns.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Tennyson has two country houses, &amp; some people might say "therefore <u>no home</u>"! One is "Farringford, Freshwater, Isle of Wight,"
      where he abides for about seven months in the year, the winter especially—&amp; the
      other is "Aldworth, Haslemere, Surrey", where he spends nearly four months of the
      summer, &amp; he is usually a month or five weeks in London, in the Early Spring.
   </p>
   
   <p>I think you must send me anything you would like him to have, &amp; I will make it
      a duty, as well as a pleasure, to send it on to him at once.
   </p>
   
   <p>His son, &amp; my son-in-law, Lionel Tennyson, lives in London for some ten months
      out of the twelve, at 4 Sussex Place, Regents Park, N.W.
   </p>
   
   <p>I <u>do</u> know Mrs. Gilchrist.<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r4">4</a></sup> She is re-editing the Life of
      Blake,<sup><a href="#loc.04050_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; I have a few of his letters, &amp; she has been once or twice in my house to
      copy them for her book. I am not surprised that you are attached to her. She seemed
      to me most interesting and intelligent—&amp; it is a great thing to be <u>intelligent</u>, is not it?
   </p>
   
   <p>I am much interested to hear how you live &amp; feel, taking life cheerfully. I wish we
      could clasp
      hands and talk of many matters. Spiritual as well as temporal. but there is a
      great callous
      Atlantic betwixt us. but I daresay you would hardly allow that the Atlantic was
      callous!

      Yours [

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0905">1. Frederick Locker-Lampson
      (1821–1895), an English poet, corresponded with Whitman in 1880.
      Locker-Lampson's daughter Eleanor married Lionel Tennyson, younger son of the
      poet Alfred Lord Tennyson.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="man.00035_n1">2. See the letter from Whitman
      to Locker-Lampson of . "A Riddle Song"
      appeared in the Tarrytown <em>Sunnyside Press</em> on April
      3.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0625">3. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0259">4. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
