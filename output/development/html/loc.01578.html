      <br></br><br></br>My dear Edmund Yates,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pardon me for my forgetfulness about the pictures. I send you three, to make it up.
      
      I have been putting off every thing—forgetting every thing—till I feel well again—for
      I am still in a pretty bad way—but shall come round again by-and-by, 
      with the blessing of God—And so, (as Mr. Philp's<sup><a href="#loc.01578_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> messenger is waiting) I shake hands across—&amp; abruptly bid you good bye, for this
      time.
      
   </p>

      Doyle's comments on Yates's meetings with Walt Whitman, in <em>The
         Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902],
