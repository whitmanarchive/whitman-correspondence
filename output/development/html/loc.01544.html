   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will just write you a line, as you may be looking for word from me Saturday. The
      weather has let up a little, 
      but it is cold enough yet—I have been to the Italian Opera twice, heard Nilsson both
      times,—she is <u>very fine</u>—One night <u>Trovatore</u> &amp; 
      one, <u>Robert</u>, with Brignoli—both good<sup><a href="#loc.01544_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I expect to return in about two weeks—I am writing this here in the kitchen home,—I
      have deserted my own room 
      this visit, as it is so cold, even with a fire—Mother had a bad spell three days,
      commencing Sunday last.—but is about as usual to-day &amp; yesterday—We have splendid
      buckwheat cakes for breakfast—sometimes I fry 
      them myself—I wish you could just be here &amp; eat breakfast—I think my mammy makes the
      best coffee in the 
      world, &amp; buckwheats ditto—mince-pies ditto—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—My new edition looks the best yet—it is from the same plates as the last, only in
      One Vol. bound handsomely 
      in green cloth—my books are beginning to do pretty well—I send you the publisher's
      slip—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well Pete I believe that is all this time—Remember me to any of the boys on the road
      that may inquire for me—also to Adrian Jones,<sup><a href="#loc.01544_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> that works in the theatre—it is now after 10, Friday forenoon, clear, cold, &amp; windy—&amp;
      I am going over to N.Y. to have a lot of my books sent to England by to-morrow's steamer—Dear
      son, I send 
      my best love, as always. We will soon be together again dear son.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
