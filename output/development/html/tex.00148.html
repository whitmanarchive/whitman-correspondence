      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I received your letter on Saturday—I am well as usual—shall write to Han to-day—Mother,
      write soon as convenient after you get this, as I shall want to know if it reached
      you all right—I have no doubt George will do well in his business—of course there
      will be slack times once in a while—I have seen the "Radical"<sup><a href="#tex.00148_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Mother, I sometimes think the old letter carrier you had, must be the thief<sup><a href="#tex.00148_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—We have fine weather, plenty of rain to keep down the dust. We had the greatest black
      procession here last Thursday—I didn't think there was so many darkeys, (especially
      wenches,) in the world—it was the anniversary of emancipation in this District—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, you must try to take the moving [cooly]<sup><a href="#tex.00148_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Well I believe that is all this time—Good bye, dearest mother—Love to sister Mat<sup><a href="#tex.00148_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; the little girls.<sup><a href="#tex.00148_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00148_n1">1. A favorable review of <em>Drum-Taps</em> appeared in <em>The Radical: A
         Monthly Magazine, Devoted to Religion</em>, 1 (April, 1866), 311–312:
      "The author of 'Leaves of Grass,' is as unquestionably a true poet, as the
      greatest of his contemporaries. He seems to us more purely permeated with the
      subtile essence of poetry than almost any other." Anne Gilchrist's "A Woman's
      Estimate of Walt Whitman" also appeared in this journal, 7 (1870),
      345–359.<a href="#r1">[back]
