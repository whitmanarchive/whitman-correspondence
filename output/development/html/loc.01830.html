   </p>
   
   
   <p>You have, I believe, in your hands certain charges against Judge Kelly of
      Idaho. His friends are <u>my</u> friends, and
      while I do not know much of him personally, I nevertheless know his accuser,
      Delegate
      Holbrook,
      to be a very bad man—one of the worst in the territory. It seems to me that
      nothing good or proper can come out of him. Do not misunderstand me, but if you can
      do anything for Judge K. to aid him, without compromising your duty, you will be
      doing me a 
       favor.
   </p>
   
   <p>I congratulate you, my dear fellow, on the great appreciation which [

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Hiram J. Ramsdell (1839–1887) was a clerk in
      Washington; in a hospital notebook (Henry E. Huntington Library), Walt Whitman
      called him "chief clerk."Ramsdell was the Washington correspondent for the New
      York <em>Tribune</em> and the Cincinnati <em>Commercial</em>. On , Ramsdell
      reported the high praise that George Townsend, the journalist (1841–1914),
      accorded to Walt Whitman—"a stupendous genius," "the song of a God." On
      , he asked Walt Whitman to do
      whatever he could for Judge Milton Kelly, of Idaho, against whom charges had
      been brought by "a very bad man," Congressman Edward Dexter Holbrook
      (1836–1870), a Democrat from the Idaho Territory. Actually, on July 12,
      1867, Walt Whitman had submitted to the Attorney General a "Report on the <em>Charges</em> submitted by <em>Hon. E. D.
         Holbrook</em>, Del[egate] from Idaho Terr[itory], <em>against</em>
      <em>Hon. Milton Kelly</em>, Asso[ciate] Just[ice] Supreme Court of
      Idaho" (National Archives). To this forty-one page summary of the evidence, all
      in Walt Whitman's hand, there is appended a letter signed by attorney general
      Henry Stanbery (1803–1881) but written by Walt Whitman, dated July 20,
      1867: "The Conclusion in the preceding Report is hereby adopted by me, &amp;
      ordered to stand as the decision of this Office in the Case, so far as now
      presented." On July 22, 1867, Ramsdell apologized for his "aggressiveness."
      (Ramsdell's letters are in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.) Judge Kelly
      wrote to Walt Whitman on June(?) 21, 1867 (National Archives), and again on  (Yale). On November 15, 1875,
      Ramsdell, among others, petitioned Benjamin H. Bristow (1832–1896),
      Secretary of the Treasury, that Walt Whitman "be appointed to a position in the
      Treasury Department" (National Archives).
