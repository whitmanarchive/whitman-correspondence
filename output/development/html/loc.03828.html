      <br></br><br></br>Dear W. Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This is rather late I am afraid to wish you a Merry Christmas—or even a happy
      New Year—but I had forgotten all about Christmas till it was on me. I have
      come here to Switzerland to have a little winter, such as one gets in America, the
      winter in England is a poor affair generally, but I see in the papers that it is
      cold enough there now. My family live happily in London, though it is always fog
      there when there is frost—I should think they would choke, but they seem to
      like it. But I don't, so I packed up my books and came here. In summer Grindewald is one
      of the most crowded of the Swiss places but now, in the winter there are only a few
      people, almost all English, who came here for the skating and courting. We are in
      a
      [
      <span class="unclear">hole?</span>]
      , surrounded
      by tremendous mountains, and the sun has not yet got high enough to shine in yet.
      The wind never blows, but we have day after day of clear cold weather, when one
      feels so well and strung. We have a very jolly party—five or six people from
      Oxford—a master from one of the great English schools with one of his boys, an
      English member of Parliament or two, and several ladies.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The Costelloes have gone to Italy and Alys<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> with them, and
      they write that they are having a most delightful time there among the churches and
      pictures. Alys is going to stay on a month &amp; learn Italian &amp; then in
      February she is going to Sicily with my mother.
   </p>
   
   <p>The "Parnell Crisis" has been the one great topic of late. At first we feared that
      Home Rule was dead, but now, since the election at Kilkenny, things are looking better, and it
      may not be so bad after all. But it has been most exciting—certainly the Irish
      make politics dramatic. It always seems to be the unexpected that occurs. Mrs.
      Costelloe<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> does a great deal of speaking, and is
      getting quite a name.
   </p>
   
   <p>How did you like the American elections? I was <u>delighted</u> it
      seems to me that the time has come for the Republicans to go. All my American
      friends—young men who have gone in for politics—are [
      <span class="unclear">washing?</span>]
       with the
      Democratic party.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your books were so much appreciated in Oxford, and that great one you sent my father
      is certainly a royal book. Are you writing anything else?
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish I had got this letter off in time to wish you a happy Christmans—but you
      must accept my somewhat tardy letter as if it had come earlier.
   </p>

      ever yours with love

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Logan Pearsall Smith
      (1865–1946) was an essayist and literary critic. He was the son of Robert
      Pearsall Smith, a minister and writer who befriended Whitman, and he was the
      brother of Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, one of Whitman's most avid followers.

   <p id="loc.05908_n1">1. Alys Smith
      (1867–1951) was a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith and eventually married

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">2. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
