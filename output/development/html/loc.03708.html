      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>You will remember my calling a few weeks back when I remember
      that I do so as a friend <u>of</u> Earl Russell's<sup><a href="#n6146" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; I [
      <span class="unclear">much?</span>]
       regret that before
      leaving Phila I could not get over to say good-bye, but I was called on business to
      New York &amp; so
      could not help it. I take the Herald in here pretty regularly &amp; am always delighted
      
      at the lines I find of yours there &amp; I trust you will long continue to [
      <span class="unclear">rejoice?</span>]
       our hearts
      with that that is so beautiful and good in Nature.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am as you know an Englishman
      &amp; am proud to be one of many thousands of my fellow countrymen who have received
      so much good cheer from your writings
   </p>
   
   <p>I am about to ask a favor from you, thinking that it is perhaps in your power to
      render it. I am anxious to make the acquaintance of Col Robert Ingersoll,<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r2">2</a></sup> a man whom I much admire for his outspoken attitude &amp; I
      wish to ask if you can give me a letter of introduction to him.
   </p>
    
   
   <p>I shall be greatly obliged if you can. I trust I am not asking what is out of your
      power to give.
   </p>
   
   <p>Again a great lady friend of mine &amp; a great admirer of yours has asked me if possible
      to get your
      autograph, &amp; so, I have taken the liberty of asking this double favor. I am about
      to go next door. I shall
      most likely call at Phila on my way where I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you
      again. With 
      best wishes for your health &amp; happiness
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n6146">1. John Francis Stanley Russell (1865–1931), also
      known as Earl Russell, 2nd Earl Russell, and Frank Russell, was a barrister and
      the brother of Bertrand Russell.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0839">2. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r2">[back]
