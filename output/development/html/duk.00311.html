      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The enclosed letter from George<sup><a href="#duk.00311_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I should have sent you before but have been so busy that I have neglected it &nbsp;There
      is nothing particularly new at home with the exception that Mother is not well. She
      has been very unwell for the last few days. She has a very steady and severe pain,
      she thinks a gathering or enlargement, in the right side of her chest. For a day or
      two she was almost helpless. Night before last Mat made her a poultice of elm and
      it seems to have done her good. I can not get her to allow herself to be taken care
      of or to take care of herself. She has been very foolish in house cleaning, she has
      done more work—whitewashing and cleaning—than any man ought to have done. Yet all
      the talking that Mat and I could do was no avail. I am really fearful that she has
      permanently hurt herself. If she does not get better by tomorrow I shall have the
      doctor to see her &nbsp;Its very provoking to have Mother kill herself so persistently.
      She is much worse I think than she used to be. She has an idea that she cannot afford
      to have anything hired. Im in hopes that you will make and carry out the idea of coming to New York.<sup><a href="#duk.00311_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I cannot imagine what it is that ails mother. I hope nothing serious
   </p>
   
   <p>In regard to the house I belive its settled that we all stay as we are. I sent for Brown<sup><a href="#duk.00311_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> to come up and see me the other evening. He said that if he had to pay more rent
      he would have to move. That he should like to stay but that he would move rather than
      pay more &nbsp;I thought the matter all over—I did not want to take the whole house—I did
      not want to move—it would not make but a difference of abt a $ per month so I told Brown he could stay and I would bear the increased rent.
      As it now stands it is as follows &nbsp;Mother pays $85 per year, I pay $147 per year and
      Brown $168 per year. I took out an agreement for Mothers and my names at $19 33 per
      month
   </p>
   
   <p>Did you get my letter enclosing $5 from Mr Lane.<sup><a href="#duk.00311_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> Why do you not write me? is there any reason? I was in hopes that I would hear from
      you sometime ago.
   </p>
   
   <p>I wrote you to write me a letter to show Mr Worthen<sup><a href="#duk.00311_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> of New York. I think we could get some money through him.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mattie and the babies are quite well. The children are both growing finely &nbsp;If Mother
      does not get better in a few days I will write you again
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00311_n1">1. Jeff Whitman's letter
      was written on the verso of George Whitman's letter to his mother of . See <em>Civil War
         Letters of George Washington Whitman</em>, ed. Jerome M. Loving (Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975), 111.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00311_n2">2. In his letter to Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman of , Walt Whitman
      indicated that he wanted to return to New York to see the family and to bring
      out his new book of poems, <em>Drum-Taps</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00311_n3">3. See Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman from .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00311_n4">4. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
      and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter of
      , and later various sums which
      Whitman acknowledged in letters from , , , and . In his letter of ,
      Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in the Henry W. and
      Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman wrote, obviously for
      publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of money, contributed for
      that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly through Moses
      Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there)." Lane assisted Whitman in other ways
      as well (see Whitman's letters from , and ). He was so
      solicitous of Whitman's personal welfare that on , he sent through Jeff $5 "for your own especial
      benefit."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00311_n5">5. See Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's letters to Walt Whitman from , and . Worthen sent
      twenty dollars to Whitman on , and
      expressed his hope "to send more from time to time." Whitman replied on May 24
      (?), 1864, and wrote Worthen again two years later on December 20, 1866; both of
      these letters are lost. See <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin
      Haviland Miller (New York: New York University Press, 1961–77), 1:368,
