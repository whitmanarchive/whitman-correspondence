   <p>Your dear letter came this morning, enclosing Dr Channing's<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n5" id="r2">2</a></sup> (herewith returned)<sup><a href="#nyp.00725_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      Thank you &amp; Dr. C. &amp; dear Grace<sup><a href="#n6143" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; Stedman<sup><a href="#n1043" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; all—all the
      movements are certainly <em>roseate</em> toward me &amp; I feel
      thankful &amp; responsive—&amp; all the confirmatory possible—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am still kept in my room, hoping each day to get firmer &amp; stronger &amp; get
      out—but no such day comes yet—or even the indication of it—&amp;
      to-day Saturday a fearful hot &amp; oppressive <em>baker &amp; prostrater</em>, the worst 
      to my feelings, as I sit here, of any yet—there is no set back, so far—but if a long
      spell of hot unhealthy
      August weather sets in "the second time of that man will be worse than the
      first"—
   </p>
   
   <p>The <em>November Boughs</em><sup><a href="#n3999" id="r6">6</a></sup> (did I tell you?) is all done 
      <em>in copy</em>—The printing office is now all diverged on a
      Harrison and Morton book,<sup><a href="#nyp.00725_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup> hurry is up—will take them a week—my <em>Boughs</em> will be at least two months before
      published—possibly longer—I remain in good spirits—It seems to be grow[ing] hotter
      &amp; melter—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00725_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd Aug 31/88." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service |
      Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | Aug 4 | 8 PM | 88;
      Washington, Rec'd | Aug 5 | 7 AM | 88 | 1.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00945_n5">2. William F. Channing
      (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
      Whitman stayed at his home in October, 1868.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00725_n2">3. On  O'Connor mentioned that Grace
      Channing's calendar (see Whitman's , letter to Charles W. Eldridge) had been sent to Stedman, who was to
      arrange for publication (see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.23.html">Monday, August 6, 1888</a>). On the same day O'Connor wrote to thank
      Stedman for his assistance in the projected work. On September 21 Stedman
      informed Traubel that three firms had rejected publication of the calendar
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.70.html">Saturday, September 22, 1888</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6143">4. Grace Ellery Channing
      (1862–1937) was a writer and editor. She was the niece of William D.
      O'Connor. In 1894 she married artist Charles Walter Stetson, soon after his
      divorce from Channing's lifelong friend, writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman. After
      her initial refusal to ever read Whitman's work, Channing became enthralled by
      the poet's words and, in 1887, had the idea of creating an illustrated calendar
      with excerpts from <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. The illustrations
      would be made by Walter Stetson. The project was never realized. For more on the
      calendar project, see see Joann Krieg, "Grace Ellery Channing and the Whitman
      Calendar," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 12:4 (1995),
      252–256. Channing published her own volume of Whitman-inspired poetry
      titled <em>Sea-Drift</em> in 1899.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1043">5. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">6. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00725_n3">7. Whitman is probably
      referring to Reverend G. L. Harney's <em>The Lives of Benjamin
         Harrison, and Levi P. Morton</em> (1888).<a href="#r7">[back]
