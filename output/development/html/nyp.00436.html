      "Forward all this budget 'A to L inclusive' to Dr. Bucke." It is addressed: Wm D
      O'Connor | Life Saving Service | Bureau | Washington D C. It is postmarked:
      Camden | May | 3 | 12 M | N.J.; Washington, D. C. | May | 4 | 4 AM | 1882 |

   <p id="nyp.00436_n2">2. It is unfortunate that
      Whitman's correspondence with Richard Maurice Bucke at this time is lost, for it
      would presumably reveal that after the poet informed Bucke of Osgood's decision
      on April 19, the latter suggested that O'Connor be enlisted to reply to the
      charges of obscenity. Since the poet and O'Connor had been estranged for ten
      years, Bucke undoubtedly wrote to O'Connor to obtain his consent. Probably
      Whitman discussed the matter frankly in a "long letter" to Bucke on April 27
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). At any
      rate their correspondence resumed without mention of their misunderstanding.
      Jottings in Whitman's Commonplace Book suggest that Whitman had attempted to
      heal the wounds for many years. He sent to O'Connor the following books and
      articles: <em>Memoranda During the War</em> in April, 1876; the
      Centennial Edition in March, 1879; his Emerson article in <em>The
         Literary World</em> in May, 1880; "Poetry of the Future" in December, 1880;
      <em>The Progress</em> of April 30, 1881; <em>The
         Critic</em> of May 9, 1881; the <em>New York Tribune</em> of
      August 4, 1881; and the Osgood edition on December 25, 1881.<a href="#r2">[back]
