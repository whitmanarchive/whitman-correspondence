      <br></br><br></br>Dear Whitman,—
      
   </p>            
   
   
   <p>If you will permit me to address you thus<sup><a href="#n1001" id="r2">2</a></sup>—for some time past I have been collecting Tales, and other prose sketches by you,
      and now want to edit them for a vol., if you see no objection? I need scarcely remark
      that you should receive a fair (—so far as publishers' fairness goes—) remuneration
      for the vol. If you do not disapprove of the project, perhaps, you would not mind
      cooperating with me in the production of the work, by pointing out the essays you
      wish rejected, revised, or included? Will you let me know your views? My <u>name</u> 
      
           
      
      is known to your friend Mr. O'Connor,<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r3">3</a></sup> of Washington, and, personally, I am well known to Mr. W.M. Rossetti,<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r4">4</a></sup> through whom I had the pleasure of subscribing for the "Two Rivulets." If you thought
      well of the idea you might like to take a part payment in sheets, or bound copies,
      from the publishers?  I would edit the work for England and prefix a short essay.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I enclose prospectus of my Editions of Poe's works. I have just published a new vindication
      "Memoir of Poe" in 2 vols. and am <u>always</u> desirous of gathering up information about him: Can you help me? Have you copies
      of <u>any</u>
      
           
      
      <u>any</u> correspondence with him you would permit me to see, or anything about him, or any
      reminiscences? He published some remarks of yours on "Music" in his <u>Broadway Journal</u>; with a few words of approval, in 1845.<sup><a href="#n1002" id="r5">5</a></sup> You may, therefore, have known him.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Have you had a good portrait of yourself etched, engraved, or made in any permanent
      form? If so, will you kindly favour me with a copy—will you kindly say cost &amp; will forward it you need not send till you get the money—or,
      if not any of this class, will you kindly send me another photo like that in the "Two
      Rivulets"? Only <u>not mounted</u> as I want it for mounting in my own fashion, safest way of sending is round a small
      wooden roller. Hoping your recent travel has done your health good, and to hear from
      you speedily,
   </p>

   <p id="n1001">2. John Henry Ingram
      (1842–1916), an English editor, collector, and biographer, wrote several
      memoirs about Edgar Allan Poe, largely in opposition to a Poe memoir written in
      1850 by Rufus W. Griswold, which Ingram believed was filled with lies. Ingram
      also wrote critical studies of Thomas Chatterton and Christopher Marlowe. For
      more on Ingram, see John Carl Miller, "John Henry Ingram: Editor, Biographer,
      and Collector of Poe Materials," in <em>A Guide to John Henry
         Ingram's Poe Collection at the University of Virginia</em> (Charlottesville:
      University of Virginia, 2007).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n2002">3. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">4. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1002">5. Whitman's piece was entitled
      "Art-Singing and Heart-Singing" and was published on November 29, 1845, in the
      <em> Broadway Journal</em>, which was then edited by Poe. The
      article argued for an American music which would distance itself from European
      influences.<a href="#r5">[back]
