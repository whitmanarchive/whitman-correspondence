      <br></br><br></br>Dear Abby,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have seen Major Saxton,<sup><a href="#pml.00030_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; handed him your note, &amp; the accompanying paper—he said he knew the 4th Auditor
      personally, &amp; would see him about it, &amp; would probably write to you within three or
      four days. So Arthur<sup><a href="#pml.00030_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> is home, &amp; you are all well—what with the baby<sup><a href="#pml.00030_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; all you women—what jolly times you must have—I wish I could just drop in and take
      part in them—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>With me, nothing very new or special—I am well &amp; hearty—feel first-rate the greater
      part of the time—and as to streaks of the other kind of feeling, I am thankful they
      are so few—for you know I am getting to be an old fellow—though my temperament for
      buoyancy &amp; fun I believe increases instead of diminishes—I shall take my vacation
      considerably earlier than usual, this summer—so it wont be long before I shall see
      you all.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Love to all—not forgetting the baby.
      <br></br>Walt.

   <p>Abby, Willard Saxton's address is 1st Comptroler's office Treasury Dep't.</p>
