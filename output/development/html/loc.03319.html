      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Back here again last night—after a fine time of it at Mrs. Nordhoff's,<sup><a href="#n4141" id="r1">1</a></sup> where everyone was so kind &amp; the fun so continued all day long, that I did not find
      time to write you even a line.
   </p> 
   
   <p>There were some jolly young fellows there, &amp; some splendid girls, but among the last
      
      I think Alys Smith<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> may be said to have "taken the cake." Dressed as Portia, when a Shakespeare masquerade
      (in which everyone took some part from the plays) was being enacted, it would have
      delighted your eyes to see her dance,—"A wild Bacchante passionate of foot!"—The house
      itself stands on the Palisades of the Hudson, about 500 feet or so above 
      the river on a steep cliff, commanding a superb view right over to the sea &amp; far away
      up &amp; down the Hudson. The place [
      <span class="unclear">would?</span>]
       
      
      have thoroughly suited you for a camping spot.
   </p>
   
   <p>Passing through New York yesterday, in a bright, splendid sunlight, the rush of life
      in Broadway made me wish you could have been with me there.
   </p>            
   
   <p>After the stupid, half-&amp;-half pretence of Philadelphia, the reckless, go-ahead life
      in New York is very refreshing. Tell this not to the Philadelphians!
   </p>                
   
   <p>No letters arrived at Alpine Bergen for me,—so I suppose none have reached you! If
      there are any waiting now, will you mail them on here. I expect to go to Boston on
      Friday or Saturday—after which my address will be to the care of Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r3">3</a></sup> at Belmont.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you are feeling well these bright days. I am trying to persuade myself that
      from this New Year forward everything is to be first-rate with me &amp; with all my friends—in
      the higher, eternal sense, if not always &amp; altogether in the other!
   </p>

      With much love,

   <p>Best rememberances to Mrs. Davies!<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4141">1. Lida Nordhoff was the wife of
      author and New York <em>Evening Post</em> and <em>Herald </em>newspaper correspondent and editor Charles Nordhoff
      (1830–1901); they were among the first of the wealthy families to build
      vacation estates on the New Jersey Palisades in the late 1800s.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05908_n1">2. Alys Smith
      (1867–1951) was a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith and eventually married
      the philosopher Bertrand Russell.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">3. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n6113">4. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
