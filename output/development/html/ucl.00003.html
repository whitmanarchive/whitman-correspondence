   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="ucl.00003_n1">1. This letter may have been
      sent to L. O. Bliss of Iowa Falls, Iowa, to whom Whitman sent a "gilt-top L of
      G" on December 18 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="ucl.00003_n2">2. Whitman was inaccurate,
      perhaps deliberately: he was with the Staffords at Glendale from November 18 to
      27 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). See Whitman's letter to William Sloane Kennedy
      of .<a href="#r2">[back]
