   <p>I have your note of last Saturday and Sunday enclosing M<u>c</u>Kenzie's
      note<sup><a href="#loc.07331_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and Carpenter's<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r3">3</a></sup> photo. The
      latter is good and very welcome. That piece on "Old Poets &amp;c"<sup><a href="#loc.07745_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> ought to be good. There is one "old poet", at least,
      whom you sh<u>d</u> know about by this time. I fear you are not having a good time, old
      friend, with that miserable stupid feeling all the time. We too here are having
      quite a time of our own. Something like 60 or 70 per cent of the (so called) sane
      people about the institution more or less sick. 2 out of the 4 doctors in bed nearly
      every one at my house sick. (But nothing dangerous about the disease so we can afford
      to laugh at it). W<u>m</u> Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r5">5</a></sup> has been here a week sick all the
      time, still quite sick tho out of bed and on the mend. If "La Grippe" attacks the
      patients (a few of them have it now) in the same percentage as the employees we
      have a cheerful time ahead of us

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0141b">3. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n4284">5. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
