   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02239_n1">1. This is a draft letter.
      On May 2, in a lost letter, Whitman asked Green to give him an estimate, which
      Green supplied on May 3 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Probably
      Whitman accepted the offer on the following day. Green evidently delivered 600
      copies to the binders on May 24, for in the Feinberg Collection, there is a
      check for $157 made out to Green on May 31. Green had printed some of Whitman's
      earlier works; see the letter from Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02239_n2">2. In the second printing of
      the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> intercalations included: "As in
      a Swoon," "The Beauty of the Ship," "When the Full-Grown Poet Came," and "After
      an Interval."<a href="#r2">[back]
