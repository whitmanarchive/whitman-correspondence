      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>William O'Connor has returned, &amp; has brought me news from you all, &amp;
      about Jeff's offer to go to St. Louis.<sup><a href="#hyb.00001_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> I don't know what to advise
      about it—but feel as if I was rather in favor of accepting the offer. Jeff
      must take it cool, &amp; not get excited about it—&amp; after he has <em>decided</em> which to do, must go ahead for good, &amp; not
      doubt his decision, or fear he has done wrong, &amp;c—I believe that's
      about all I wish to say on it, at present. Wm. O'Connor was much pleased with
      his visit, &amp; speaks about you &amp; all—he is a good fellow, &amp;
      has been a good friend to me. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I send you the Harper's Weekly, with the picture of Abraham Lincoln &amp;
      the Drummer Boy<sup><a href="#hyb.00001_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I think it is tip top—We are having warm weather
      here—I am feeling very well indeed—I was down at the hospital
      Sunday afternoon—the young man that had delirium tremens, that prayed so
      long, has got quite well<sup><a href="#hyb.00001_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>—his
      prayers seemed to be answered—at any rate, he is well &amp; gone back to
      duty—while several others with the same complaint, are lying there not yet
      recovered—One soldier, 12th Infantry, was dying while I was there—he had pneumonia—it
      was a very sudden &amp; dangerous attack, only taken
      two or three days before—he had been in the war, &amp; had been wounded
      badly—but sickness took him off at last—I sat by him about half an
      hour—breathing was very oppressive indeed—It was a fine afternoon,
      &amp; very still in the ward—&amp; off a block or so there is a big
      Catholic church, St. Aloysius Church—they were ringing a chime of bells,
      three or four bells playing a sort of tune, sounded loud &amp; joyful—I
      sat and listened for a long while—the poor dying man kept looking at me
      with such a look—

   <p>Since the other sheet was written &amp; just as I was going to enclose, your
      letter of Saturday came. You must not be uneasy about a place—there will
      be some way provided—If not one way, it will be another, I hope—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So mother, keep a good heart—I guess I must try to come on to Brooklyn
      &amp; set you all right—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="hyb.00001_n2">1. Jeff's offer was to cause
      excitement and confusion in the Whitman household. Martha bustled about; Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman did not know where she was to live, and complained about
      Martha and the general turmoil.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00001_n3">2. The issue of April 27, 1867
      contained Thomas Nast's (1840–1902) illustration "Abraham Lincoln and the
      Drummer-Boy."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00001_n4">3. Walt Whitman first wrote of
      this soldier in his  letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r3">[back]
