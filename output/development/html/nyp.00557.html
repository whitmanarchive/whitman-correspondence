      <br xmlns="" class="opener">March 2, 1884.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Just a line to give you my changed address. I have been here
      since October last—very busy all last summer getting a little homestead built,
      and this winter digging and planting—have about seven acres
      altogether—we are gardening about two acres; fruit, flowers and vegetables;
      have about two and a half acres grass and about the same quantity part wheat for
      ourselves and part oats for the horse. My friends the Fearnehoughs<sup><a href="#n3063" id="r1">1</a></sup> have come with me, and we are employing one or two extra hands
      beside, just now. It is a beautiful valley right up against the Derbyshire moors,
      but warm; we are about eight miles form Sheffield and five and a half from
      Chesterfield—three and a half from the nearest station. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I got your bit about the American aborigines.<sup><a href="#uva.00452_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> Thanks. 
   </p>
   
   <p> There is a quite old flour mill here, from which the place no doubt takes its name;
      very quaint old wooden wheels and cogs—the stream which feeds it runs at the
      bottom of my three fields—lots of wood and water all about the valley.
      Millthorpe itself is a small hamlet of a dozen houses or so. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Have not seen the Gilchrists<sup><a href="#n3001" id="r3">3</a></sup> for some time, but I heard from
      Grace the other day. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I was reading Rolleston's<sup><a href="#n1027" id="r4">4</a></sup> translation into German of your
      Answerer this morning. It is as far as I can judge very exact and natural. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I hope you are well and enjoying yourself. I often think about you. Best
      remembrances to the Staffords<sup><a href="#n1009" id="r5">5</a></sup> when you see them. 
   </p>

      Your affectionate
      <br></br>Edward Carpenter.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3063">1. Albert Fearnehough was a scythe
      maker from Bradway, Sheffield. Edward Carpenter describes him as "a muscular,
      powerful man [...], quite 'uneducated' in the ordinary sense... but well-grown
      and finely built" (Edward Carpenter, <em>My Days and Dreams</em>
      [London: George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1916], 102).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00452_n1">2. Whitman sent "An Indian
      Bureau Reminiscence" to <em>Baldwin's Monthly</em>, published by
      "Baldwin, the Clothier"; it was printed in February, 1884, and was reprinted in
      <em>To-Day</em> in May, 1884.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n3001">3. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885), widow to Alexander Gilchrist, and her four children Beatrice,
      Grace, Percy and Herbert. Anne Gilchrist wrote one of the first significant
      pieces of criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's
      Estimate of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M.
      Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59.
      Gilchrist's long correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in
      love with the poet after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she
      visited Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. Anne's son Herbert (1857–1914) was
      a painter and shared his mother's fascination for Whitman. For more on Whitman
      and the Gilchrists, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n1027">4. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.

         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

      young man who Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's parents, George and
      Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near Kirkwood, New
      Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. For more on Whitman and
