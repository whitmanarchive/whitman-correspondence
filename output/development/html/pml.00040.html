   </p>
   
   
   <p>your letter has come, &amp; is welcome. Dear Abby, &amp; dear friends all, 
      the doctors say I will get well, &amp; I say so too—but which ever way it goes, 
      it will be all right—the little Philadelphia paper piece was about the right 
      statement of my case from a favorable point of view—I shall remain here 
      for the present—I get around middling well—the worst is bad spells in the head 
      which persistently return—if I get a little better I may like to come on 
      &amp; pay you a visit—upstairs will do just as well for me, as I get up &amp; down 
      better than you would think. I will write to you beforehand should I come.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My brother Jeff has come on from St. Louis for a while—stopt here yesterday 
      though only a few hours—has gone on to N.Y. to a good sailing excursion, 
      a week on a yacht voyage—I told him to call on you, if possible—&amp; he will if he can
      work it—My brother &amp; sister here are well as usual—Eddy the same—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Helen, if you see Miss Hillard tell her I rec'd her letter &amp; thank her for it—I have not felt to write to her, or any one but my
      sisters, about mother's death—the great dark cloud of my life—the only staggering,
      staying blow &amp; trouble I have had—but <em>unspeakable</em>—my physical sickness, bad as it is, is nothing to it—
   </p>
