   <p>'Specimen Days' safely arrived, a really beautiful book externally.<sup><a href="#n1027" id="r1">1</a></sup> Many, many thanks for the gift. I have been looking through it
      and find much that I had not seen anywhere before. I see you have put in your letter
      about the Russian translation, to Lee.<sup><a href="#loc.05144_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Did I tell
      you—(or was it in the letter that went astray?) that Lee has got an
      appointment in England which will take up all his time except in vacations, for the present at any rate? I
      haven't heard from him now for months, though I wrote twice. I know he meant to go
      into Servia and Bosnia early this year &amp; hope he hasn't got into any trouble
      there—he &amp; a friend had a rather narrow escape for 
      there
      
       lives in those parts year before last. He is a great enthusiast for
      Panslavism, but brigands wouldn't respect that. My translation I hope to get finished by
      Spring. When it approaches completion I will lecture on it in the Literarischer
      Verein<sup><a href="#loc.05119_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; see if I cannot induce any of the
      members of it to join me in preparing it for the press, revising, etc. Or do you
      know, by correspondence or otherwise, any competent German with whom you could put
      me in communication? Not yet however; it is best, I think, that I should have it all
      turned into literal effective German, the sense of leading words penetrated, etc.
      before we go at it together. It will much facilitate the work.
   </p>
   
   <p>To find one who will really cooperate with energy in giving a faithful presentment
      of
      your book will be difficult, for German literature (and art and all mental products)
      of this day is cramped by formalities and proprieties to an inconceivable
      extent—far more so than in England. Art in all branches is thought of as a
      technique—anything like strong individuality is despised—or if it
      happens to escape that fate is overtaken by a still worse one, in being lauded as
      if
      it were a piece of correct conventionalism like everything else. —I have known this with the L of
      G. This is the tone among those who take the lead in aesthetic matters,
      but there is a silent mass in the background whom I reckon on.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1027">1. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05144_n2">2. John Fitzgerald Lee was a
      student at Trinity College, Dublin, and a friend of Thomas W. H. Rolleston. On
      , Lee wrote to Whitman
      requesting permission to translate <em>Leaves of Grass</em> into
      Russian (see <em>Whitman and Rolleston—A Correspondence</em>, ed.
      Horst Frenz [Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1951],
      48–50). Nothing came of Lee's projected translation.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05119_n3">3. Rolleston read a lecture
      on Whitman before the Literarischer Verein of Dresden on September 25, 1883. The
      lecture was published in <em>Ueber Wordsworth und Walt
         Whitman</em>; Zwei Vorträge von H. B. Cotterill und T. W. Rolleston
      (Dresden, 1883). Rolleston gave a humorous account of the Dresden society in
      "The Literarischer Verein of Augustusstadt," <em>The Dublin
         University Review</em>, 1 (April 1885), 50–52. The article, which is
      signed "T.W.R.," contains some interesting reflections on German poetry and
      criticism. Rolleston also commented on the lectures on Wordsworth and Whitman
      which he and Cotterill had given before the society and claimed that "Walt
      Whitman got, on the whole, a rather more encouraging reception, perhaps because
      he was treated from a more exlusively philosophical point of view." After the
      joint publication, in pamphlet form, of <em>Ueber Wordsworth und
         Walt Whitman</em>, a good part of it was translated into English by Horace
      Traubel and appeared in the Camden <em>Post</em> on Feburary 13,
      1884.<a href="#r3">[back]
