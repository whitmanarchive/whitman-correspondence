      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your two Bolton friends and admirers, J. Johnston<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; J. W.
      Wallace,<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r2">2</a></sup> again write in sending you their love and best wishes on your Birthday.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are very thankful to have within our power the means of again communicating with
      you and of sending you a small token of our deep and continued reverence &amp;
      affection.
   </p>
   
   <p>Since our last letter your <u>November Boughs</u><sup><a href="#n3999" id="r3">3</a></sup> has appeared—of which
      we each immediately procured a copy. And not the least of the pleasures it gave us
      was the admirable portrait of yourself on the frontispiece. Every line of the book
      has been carefully read—most of it again &amp; again—&amp; has increased the
      heavy debt we owe you. We feel, too, in reading its closing lines that besides your
      other great services to humanity, <u>you</u>, too, like Elias
      Hicks,<sup><a href="#n4265" id="r4">4</a></sup> like George Fox,<sup><a href="#n4326" id="r5">5</a></sup> have "laboured", and "made
      contributions" to, and, "best of all set an incarnated example" of, life spent in
      the constant "thought of God, merged in the thoughts of moral right and the immortality of
      identity."—But <u>your</u> contributions have been far
      greater, and of immeasurably wider scope than theirs, inasmuch as they go along with
      a vastly increased intellectual power and range, and are "consistent with the
      Hegelian formulas, and consistent with modern science." By these immense services
      in
      these our times, and especially in your contributions to the "thought of the
      immortality of identity," you have enrolled yourself for ever amongst those who, you
      justly say, are "<u>dearest</u> to humanity,"—and are
      inexpressibly dear to <u>us</u>.
   </p>
   
   <p>We hope that the remainder of your life may be serene and calm, and cheered by the
      ardent love and gratitude of those who, like <u>us</u>, are so
      deeply indebted to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>We each send you <u>£5</u> which we should like you to expend
      in some visible token of our good will.
   </p>
   
   <p>We also enclose <u>2 photos</u>. <u>1st</u>—one of <u>J.
         Johnston</u>—taken for presentation to the members of an ambulance class,
      of which he was the teacher, and who gave him the writing cabinet shown on the
      table. <u>2nd</u>
      <u>J. W. Wallace</u> in his own little room, photographed by J.
      Johnston some months ago. It isn't a good portrait, but it may<sup><a href="#loc.04405_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the

      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
