      <br></br><br></br>My Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you will pardon me for not acknowledging the books sooner, I did not write
      for
      reasons I will not stop to inumerate here.
   </p>
   
   <p>They came safely, and in good condition, and I am happy in the possession of them.
      You sent me more than I expected. I thank you for that, also for the picture.
   </p>
   
   <p>Christmas brought me a new photograph album, and I dedicated it with this you sent
      me.
   </p>
   
   <p>"If you come to Boston," Does this imply a doubt? So it seems to me.
      Come if you can. Come when you can. I suppose Boston in winter has fewer attractions than some other
      Cities, but from Spring to Autumn, I know her temples for miles around, are as varied,
      and beautiful, as
      the grand old architect could make them.
   </p>
   
   <p>Of course "Jack Frost" holds the key to many of these now. Still there's always
      something everywhere to make this old world a beatitude.
   </p>
   
   <p>No doubt your friend has returned to Cambridge, tho' I have not seen her; I shall
      try to do so
      sometime soon.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad you are in good spirits, and fair health. I wish your powers of locomotion
      was as good. For such let us pray.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Your friend very truly,
      <br></br>A.B. Drake.
