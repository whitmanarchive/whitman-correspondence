   </p>
   
   <p>If things go on as they have for the past week, you will have to think yourself lucky
      if you get even a postal in ten days. You must remember that I am housekeeper,
      nurse, marketer, &amp; have to see that the house is decent, if
      
      possible, besides being interrupted at every 
      ten minutes to answer some one who calls from a good motive to ask how Wm. is, but
      would do better not to come often.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So far I am the <u>only</u> nurse, &amp; if you have been as
      badly
      
      off as he is, you may have some idea of what it means, in this case it means that
      I
      wash &amp; dress him so far as he can be dressed,—wash his urinals, for he has
      to be protected night &amp; day, from the constant dripping,—&amp; to keep
      
      him at all clean is nearly impossible. Some nights I get not more than four hours
      sleep &amp; that very broken, &amp; some days not one moment to rest at all. To-day
      I am nearly blind from loss of sleep. We have some very bad nights since the
      
      attack four weeks ago, &amp; one of the very bad and troublesome developments is the nausea
      
      and throwing up, so you see that I am not very idle, &amp; I some days could not write
      a postal 
      card to save you.  You will ask <u>why</u> we don't have a nurse &amp; the
      
      answer is William does not want one, &amp; is not ready yet, [illegible] sends love to you &amp; says tell you he would write if he could.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4137">2. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n1027">4. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.

   <p id="n4195">5. Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), a volume Whitman often referred to
      as the "big book," was published by Philadelphia publisher David McKay in
      December 1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, he made the presswork and
      binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the book, which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more information on
      the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">7. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

      volume—not that I am overwhelmed or even entirely satisfied by it, but as
      I had not put my calculations high &amp; was even expecting to be disappointed,
      I shall accept it."<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="n3105">10. James Russell Lowell
      (1819–1891) was an American critic, poet and editor of <em>The Atlantic</em>. One Whitman's famous poetic contemporaries, Lowell was
      committed to conventional poetic form, which was clearly at odds with Whitman's
      more experimental form. Still, as editor of the <em>Atlantic
         Monthly</em>, he published Whitman's "Bardic Symbols," probably at Ralph
      Waldo Emerson's suggestion. Lowell later wrote a tribute to Abraham Lincoln
      titled "Commemoration Ode," which has often, since its publication, been
      contrasted with Whitman's own tribute, "O Captain! My Captain!" For further
