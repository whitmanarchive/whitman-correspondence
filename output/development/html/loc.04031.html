   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04031_n1">1. Henry Festing Jones
      (1851–1928) was the author of <em>Samuel Butler</em> (1919)
      and the editor of many of Butler's manuscripts. Whitman evidently forgot that he
      had promised to mail the two books. See the letters from Whitman to Jones on
       and . In his <em>Commonplace Book</em>, Whitman
      noted that he had sent an advertising circular (Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.). The inscription in <em>Leaves of Grass</em> was dated by
      Jones "July 1878." Both volumes are now in the Feinberg Collection.<a href="#r1">[back]
