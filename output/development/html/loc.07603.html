      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman, 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just been reading your lines in the "Herald"<sup><a href="#loc.07603_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> for this morning, which hold in them
      a message full of meaning for all of us who know you well. We think of your
      approaching birthday with sorrowful, &amp; yet glad, remembrance of the years that you
      have lived so well.
   </p>
   
   <p>My adventures since leaving you have not been very startling, but they have been full
      of everyday life and energy. Here in 5th Avenue, or more often in Broadway &amp; the
      less-known haunts, I have been seeing all sorts of memorable things &amp; men &amp;
      women. Yesterday my good friend Cyrus Butler,<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r2">2</a></sup> a kind &amp; wealthy old gentleman, took
      me quite a round of studios, &amp;c. We began by breakfasting sumptuously here,
      (fried shad, omelettes, tomatoes, buckwheat cakes, strawberries, coffee, &amp;c.)
      &amp; then turned in to see Col. Bob Ingersoll,<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r3">3</a></sup> meeting there
      Lawrence Barrett<sup><a href="#loc.07603_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> the actor, &amp; others. Then onto Beard's studios, &amp;c. Over to
      Brooklyn to see a crazy rhymester,—winding up again by having supper near
      midnight.
   </p>
   
   <p>To-day promises to be even more memorable, I expect to start up the Hudson River 
      by the Mary Powell (fastest boat in 
      the world, they say!) &amp; then to catch a late train up at Newburgh on to Buffalo, &amp;c.
      Thence to Dr. Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      place on Wednesday, where I will look to send you a further note on my doings.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have good news of my brother at last, &amp; so am free to sail for England in a
      fortnight.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07603_n1">1. Rhys is referring to
      Whitman's poem "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00091.html">A Carol Closing Sixty-Nine</a>," which was published in the <em>New York Herald</em> on May 21, 1888.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n5001">2. As yet we have no information about
      this person.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0839">3. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07603_n2">4. Lawrence Barrett
      (1838–1891) was an American stage actor who acted in the repertory company
      of the Boston Museum and later on the London stage. He played numerous parts
      during his career, including taking on a number of Shakespearean roles,
      sometimes acting alongside the well-known stage actor Edwin Booth.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
