      <br></br>Washington,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Tuesday morning | June 9th 1863.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Jeff's letter came yesterday &amp; was very welcome, as I wanted to hear about you all—I
      wrote to George yesterday &amp; sent Jeff's letter enclosed. It looks from some accounts
      as though the 9th Army corps might be going down into East Tennessee, (Cumberland
      Gap or perhaps bound for Knoxville.) It is an important region, &amp; has many southern
      unionists —the staunchest union man I have ever met is a young southerner in the 2d
      Tennessee (union reg't)—he was ten months in southern prisons, came up from Richmond
      paroled about ten weeks ago, &amp; has been in hospital here sick until lately—he suffered
      every thing but death, he is the one they hung up by the heels, head downwards, &amp;
      indeed worse than death, but stuck to his convictions like a hero—John Barker,<sup><a href="#loc.00773_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> a real manly fellow, I saw much of him &amp; heard much of that country that can be relied
      on. He is now gone home to his reg't.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I am feeling very well these days—my head that was stopt up so &amp; hard of hearing seems to be all right. I only hope you have had similar good
      fortune with your rheumatism, &amp; that it will continue so—I wish I could come in for
      a couple of days &amp; see you—if I should succeed in getting a transportation ticket
      that would take me to New York &amp; back, I should be tempted to come home for two or
      three days, as I want some MSS &amp; books, &amp; the trunk, &amp;c. But I will see—Mother, your
      letter week before last was very good—whenever you feel like it, you write me, dear mother, &amp; tell me every thing about the neighborhood,
      &amp; all the items of our family. And sister Mat, how is she getting along—I believe
      I will have to write a letter especially to her &amp; Sis, one of these times.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is awful dry weather here, no rain of any consequence for five or six weeks—we
      have strawberries good &amp; plenty, 15 cents a quart, with the hulls on—I go down to
      market sometimes of a morning &amp; buy two or three quarts, for the folks I take my meals
      with—Mother, do you know I have not paid, as you may say, a cent of board since I
      have been in Washington, that is for meals—four or five times I have made a rush to leave the folks &amp; find a moderate priced
      boarding house, but every time they have made such a time about it, that I have kept
      on—it is Mr. &amp; Mrs. O'Connor, (he is the author of "Harrington")<sup><a href="#loc.00773_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—he has a $1600 office in the Treasury, &amp; she is a first rate woman, a Massachusetts
      girl—they keep house in a moderate way—they have one little girl, (lost a fine boy
      about a year ago)—they have two rooms in the same house where I hire my room, &amp; I
      take breakfast (½ past 8) &amp; dinner (½ past 4) with them, as they will have it so—that's
      the way it has gone on now over five months, &amp; as I say they won't listen to my leaving—but
      I shall do so, I think—I can never forget their kindness &amp; real friendship &amp; it appears as though they would continue just the same, if it were for all our lives.
      But I have insisted on going to market, (it is pleasant in the cool of the morning,)
      and getting the things, at my own expense, two or three times a week lately—I pay
      for the room I occupy now $7 a month—the landlord is a mixture of booby, miser &amp; hog,
      his name is Gwin<sup><a href="#loc.00773_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—the landlady is a good woman, Washington raised—they are quite rich—he is Irish of
      the worst kind—has had a good office for ten years until Lincoln came in—They have
      bought another house, smaller, to live in, &amp; are going to move (were to have moved
      1st of June)—they had an auction of the house we live in yesterday, but nobody came
      to buy, so it was ridiculous—we had a red flag out, &amp; a nigger walked up &amp; down ringing
      a big bell, which is the fashion here for auctions.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, mother, the war still goes on, &amp; every thing as much in a fog as ever—&amp; the
      battles as bloody, &amp; the wounded &amp; sick getting worse &amp; plentier all the time. I see a letter in the Tribune from Lexington, Ky., June 5th, headed
      "the 9th Army Corps departing for Vicksburgh"<sup><a href="#loc.00773_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—but I cannot exactly make it out, on reading the letter carefully—I don't see any
      thing in the letter about the 9th corps moving for Vicksburgh—at any rate I think
      the 2d division is more likely to be needed in Kentucky (or as I said, in Eastern
      Tennessee) as the secesh are expected to make trouble there—But one can hardly tell—the
      only thing is to resign onesself to events as they occur—it is a sad &amp; dreary time, for so many thousands of parents
      &amp; relatives, not knowing what will occur next—Mother, I told you I think last week that I had wrote
      to Han, &amp; enclosed George's last letter to me—I wrote a week ago last Sunday—I wonder
      if she got the letter—About the pictures, I should like Jeff to send them, as soon
      as convenient—might send 20 of the big head, 10 or 12 of the standing figure, &amp; 3
      of the carte visite.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am writing this in Major Hapgood's office—it is bright &amp; pleasant, only the dust
      here in Washington is a great nuisance. Mother, your shirts do first rate. I am wearing
      them—the one I have on today suits me better than any I have ever yet had. I have
      not worn the thin coat the last week or so, as it has not been very hot lately.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I think something of commencing a series of lectures &amp; readings &amp;c.<sup><a href="#loc.00773_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> through different cities of the north, to supply myself with funds for my Hospital
      &amp; Soldiers visits—as I do not like to be beholden to the medium of others—I need a
      pretty large supply of money &amp;c. to do the good I would like to—&amp; the work grows upon
      me, &amp; fascinates me—it is the most affecting thing you ever see, the lots of poor
      sick &amp; wounded young men that depend so much, in one ward or another, upon my petting
      or soothing or feeding, sitting by them &amp; feeding them their dinner or supper, some
      are quite helpless—some wounded in both arms—or giving some trifle (for a novelty
      or a change, it isn't for the value of it,) or stopping a little while with them—nobody
      will do but me—So, mother, I feel as though I would like to inaugurate a plan by which
      I could raise means on my own hook, &amp; perhaps quite plenty too. Best love to you,
      dearest mother, &amp; to sister Mat &amp; Jeff.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00773_n1">1. John "Jack" Barker was a
      soldier in the Second Tennessee Volunteer Regiment, whom Whitman greatly admired
      for remaining loyal to the Union even while in captivity among the Confederates.
      He became sick and was transferred to a hospital, where Whitman met him for the
      first time. Barker's career is detailed in a letter from 
      . After Barker left
      the hospital, he wrote to Whitman from Camp Summerset, Kentucky, on June 5 and
      19, 1863 (T. E. Hanley Collection, University of Texas).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00773_n2">2. For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
      John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
      years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an intelligent man who
      deserved something better than the various governmental clerical posts he was to
      hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship, however, was relieved by the
      presence of Whitman whom he was to love and venerate—and defend with a
      single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of vituperation and eulogy that have
      seldom been equaled, most notably in his pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was
      the first, and in many ways the most important, of the adulators who divided
      people arbitrarily into two categories: those who were for and those who were
      against Walt Whitman. The poet praised O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous
      collection of his tales: "He was a born sample here in the 19th century of the
      flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his
      memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton,
      1910] pp. 513). For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>. Of the O'Connors, Jeff
      wrote on : "I am real glad, my dear
      Walt, that you are among such good people. I hope it will be in the power of
      some of our family to return their kindness some day. I'm sure twould be done
      with a heartfelt gratitude. Tis pleasant, too, to think, that there are still
      people of that kind left."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00773_n3">3. Carey Gwynne. Mrs.
      O'Connor, in a letter on , related with malice Gwynne's
      failure to rent an unfurnished house for $100 a month, but, like Whitman, spoke
      sympathetically of his wife. Gwynne was listed in the 1866 Directory as a clerk
      in the Treasury Department.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00773_n4">4. A dispatch with this
      heading appeared in the <em>New York Times</em> on June 8,
      1863.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00773_n5">5. In his letter of , Jeff had reservations about
      Whitman's lecture plans: "I fear that you would not meet with that success that
      you deserve. Mr Lane and I talked about the matter and both came to the
      conclusion that it would be much better if you could be appointed dispensing
      agent, or something of that kind, for some of the numerous aid
      societies." Probably about this time,
      Whitman wrote in his "Hospital Note Book" (Henry E. Huntington Library):
      "Lectures—pieces must not be dry opinions &amp; prosy doctrines, &amp;c—must be
      animated life-blood, descriptions, full of movement—with
      questions—apostrophes—declamatory passages, &amp;c (a little ad captandum is
      allowable)."Except for the concluding sentences, this paragraph appeared in <em>November Boughs</em> from (<em>The Complete
         Writings of Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Richard Maurice Bucke [New York: G. P.
      Putnam's Sons, 1902], 6:232), erroneously dated May 26, 1863.<a href="#r5">[back]
