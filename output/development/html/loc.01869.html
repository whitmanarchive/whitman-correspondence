   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John (Jack) M. Rogers was a
      Brooklyn driver with whom Whitman presumably had a loving relationship. Whitman
      first met him in Brooklyn on September 21, 1870. For more on this, see Charley
      Shively (ed) <em>Calamus Lovers. Walt Whitman's Working Class
         Camerados</em> (San Francisco: Gay Sunshine Press, 1987, pp.
      122-135).
