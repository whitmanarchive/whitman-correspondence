   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Philip Hale (1854–1934), a music critic and
      program annotator for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, wrote to Walt Whitman for
      the first time on  (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1906–1996], 3:533). Hale wrote again on October 7, 1875
       (The Library of
      Congress), to praise the "Calamus" poems and to enclose a copy of "Walt
      Whitman," which he published in the <em>Yale Literary
         Magazine</em> in November 1874, 96–104. Walt Whitman sent <em>Two Rivulets</em> to Hale on September 3, 1876 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book).
