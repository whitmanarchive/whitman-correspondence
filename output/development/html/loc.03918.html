   <p>Thanks my dear friend for the nice chicken—I have just had a part of it for
      my dinner—&amp; the <u>honey in the comb</u> just like that
      is something I like—I had a very pleasant visit out in Germantown—I went
      partly at the request of a fine jolly young Englishman who is visiting there for a
      few days, &amp; told me much about my friends in England (of whom I find I have far
      more than I knew of)—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am about as usual—feel considerably better, more able to get around since the cool
      weather has set in—had rather a bad summer—my walking power gives out
      more this year, &amp; I am afraid is destined to be worse, instead of
      better—otherwise I am about the same—appetite good—spirits
      ditto—
   </p>
   
   <p>—I am sorry I wasn't in when you stopped this forenoon—have been hoping you
      would stop this afternoon—Does George keep well this fall?—Ruth how do you
      like married life?<sup><a href="#loc.03918_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I rec'd <u>the
         cake</u>—very nice—Well Ed, how are you about Cleveland?<sup><a href="#loc.03918_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I am just as well satisfied—
   </p>
   
   <p>—I have rec'd a long letter from Herbert<sup><a href="#loc.03918_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—nothing
      very new. The Lord bless you &amp; be with you all—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).
