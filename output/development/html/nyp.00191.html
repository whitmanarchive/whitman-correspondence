      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Since I last wrote to you my illness has been gradually alleviated, until now I go
      about pretty much the same as usual—I keep pretty old-fashioned hours, rise early,
      dine at 1, &amp; go to bed before 10—My head feels clear &amp; comfortable, &amp; my strength
      has returned almost, but not quite up to what it was. I rec'd Nelly's letter, I could
      not get over to New York that afternoon—Nelly, my dear friend, you must excuse me—I
      wished much to see you, too<sup><a href="#nyp.00191_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I hope you are having a good time &amp; feeling well physically &amp; in good spirits—&amp; the
      little one, little Jenny, this line is for you, my dear. I hope you too are well—William,
      I rec'd the volume of Navy Reports, transactions of iron clads, fights, &amp;c. for '62
      &amp; '3<sup><a href="#nyp.00191_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—it will probably give me material for some pieces, thumb-nail sketches, for my "<em>Drum Taps</em>"—I take it you had that in view in sending it to me—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am trying to make arrangements to publish my volume—I shall probably try to bring
      [it] out myself, stereotype it, &amp; print an edition of 500—I could sell that number
      by my own exertions in Brooklyn &amp; New York in three weeks.
   </p>
   
   <p>I rec'd Charles Eldridge's last letter—so he is to go down to front again —how I wish
      I was in Washington to go with him &amp; Major—I should try it as I am, &amp; be glad of the
      chance—O I almost forgot the big raid—it is already a thing of the past, I find by
      my own thoughts &amp; memory, but I suppose it would not do to write a letter to Washington
      so soon &amp; not mention it—
   </p>
   
   <p>We have heard from my brother George up to the 18th inst.<sup><a href="#nyp.00191_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—he was living &amp; well up to that time—At home here all well as usual—Mother's age
      I think begins to just show—in a few weeks, she will commence her 70th year—still
      she does most of her light housework—My sister &amp; her children are well—(Nelly, I write
      these particulars for you)—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, William, about the war I have to inform you that I remain hopeful &amp; confident
      yet<sup><a href="#nyp.00191_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I still think Grant will go into Richmond—My brother describes the spirit of the
      troops as confident &amp; sanguine under all their trials—I wish you to enclose this in
      your next letter to Nelly—I wish you to give my remembrance &amp; love to the Howells,<sup><a href="#nyp.00191_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> to Miss Howard<sup><a href="#nyp.00191_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> &amp; to Arnold Johnson<sup><a href="#nyp.00191_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>—Write soon &amp; tell me all the news—tell me how is Ashton—Good bye &amp; God bless you,
      my dear friend—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived with
      William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later John
      Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington years.
      William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor often complained about the
      various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his death. However, his
      government work was relieved by the presence of Whitman, whom he was to love and
      venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
      vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
      pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
      important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
      those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
      O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
      sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
      first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910], 513). For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see Deshae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00191_n100">1. The letter is endorsed,
      "Answ'd." &nbsp;The envelope for this letter bears the address: William D O'Connor |
      Treasury Dep't <em>Light house bureau</em> | Washington | D C. It
      is postmarked: Brooklyn N. Y. | Jul | 25 | 1864.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00191_n2">2. On , Ellen O'Connor had informed Whitman
      that she would be in New York on July 20, 1864, and that she wanted to see
      him.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00191_n3">3. Whitman refers here to
      the <em>Report of the Secretary of the Navy in Relation to Armored
         Vessels</em> (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1864). Of this volume
      O'Connor wrote on : "I thought it
      might yield hints for poems. At all events, it gives one a good idea of what the
      Monitors are and can do. They are . . . an upheld finger of warning to all
      despotocracy."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00191_n5">5. On , O'Connor, who never emulated
      Whitman's calm faith in the outcome of the war, wrote: "Alas, Walt! There is no
      hope of Richmond. The campaign has proved a failure. . . . It is sad to think of
      the eighty thousand men, veterans, lost so
      fruitlessly."<a href="#r5">[back]
