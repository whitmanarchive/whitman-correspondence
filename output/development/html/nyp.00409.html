      <br></br><br></br>Dear Hank
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hear from you indirectly once in a while by Hoag,<sup><a href="#nyp.00409_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      (&amp; saw Debbie &amp; Jo<sup><a href="#nyp.00409_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> some days since)—I
      suppose you got the postal I sent you about 12 days ago<sup><a href="#nyp.00409_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—the weather has been so bad, or I should have come down—I have had
      quite a good deal to do writing—have finished quite a piece for a big magazine
      in N. Y.—the <em>North American Review</em>—it was
      ordered—I get $100 for it—I read the proof last night &amp; sent it
      off<sup><a href="#nyp.00409_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—then I have a little poem <em>the Patrol at Barnegat</em> probably in next Harper's<sup><a href="#nyp.00409_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—(but I think I told you about it)—then
      to-day I am busy on another order<sup><a href="#nyp.00409_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—So you see I
      have something to do—I will send you the <em>Review</em> piece
      when printed—I am feeling better and <em>sassier</em> this
      winter so far than for some years, am very comfortable here, plain &amp; quiet
      though—eat my allowance every time—&amp; have a little jug of <em>good Jamaica rum</em> from which I take a sip now &amp;
      then—(but not very often)—came in chill'd &amp; dumpy late yesterday
      afternoon—made myself a good mug of hot rum, &amp; felt better—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Hank, I hope you are having fair times on the road—I am glad you stick to
      it—perseverance will conquer. Horner<sup><a href="#nyp.00409_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> was here
      again a few evenings ago, an hour—How do you get on with Col: Ingersoll's
      book?<sup><a href="#nyp.00409_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> (You mustn't take too much stock in
      him)—If there is any book particular you want, you tell me, &amp; I will try
      to get it—Lots of sleighs out, good sleighing—my brother was out day
      before yesterday, &amp; got overturned—I wanted to go yesterday, but he was
      afraid for me to venture it—his nag is pretty lively, (but I should have liked
      that all the better)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>1½—just had dinner, hot soup, cold roast beef, apple pie—all
      good—the sun is out real warm, &amp; I shall go at my piece for the N Y
      order—it is for a lady, a friend of mine—she has been for years
      principal literary editor of the <em>Herald</em>, &amp; now she is
      going to start a paper of her own—pays me<sup><a href="#nyp.00409_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Is Ed<sup><a href="#nyp.00409_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> home? I should just like to have a ten mile ride
      behind his nag with the sleigh bells—Dear boy, I send you my best love &amp;
      dont you forget it—
   </p>

   <p id="nyp.00409_n4">4. "The Poetry of the
      Future" appeared in <em>The North American Review</em> in February
      (195–210). It was later called "Poetry To-day In America" (see Whitman's
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html"><em>Complete Prose Works</em></a>, 288). On January 15,
      Whitman received $100 in payment for the article (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00409_n5">5. "Patroling Barnegat" was
      sent to <em>Harper's Monthly</em> on October 9, 1880 and published
      in the April issue (Whitman's Commonplace Book). The poem had appeared in <em>The American</em> in June, 1880 (<em>The
         Cambridge History of American Literature</em>, ed. A. W. Ward and A. R.
      Waller [New York: Putnam, 1907–1921]). On May 20, 1881, Whitman sent <em>Harper's Monthly</em> "A Summer's Invocation," which was
      returned (Whitman's Commonplace Book). It appeared, however, in <em>The American</em> (see Whitman's letter to Harry Stafford on
      ).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00409_n7">7. As evidenced by an
      address mounted in Whitman's Commonplace Book, Horner was the nickname of Jacob
      H. Stafford (1850–1890), Harry's cousin, whose mother was Mary
      Horner.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00409_n8">8. Apparently Whitman gave
      Harry one of the books which Robert G. Ingersoll sent on March 25, 1880 (see the
