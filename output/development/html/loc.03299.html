      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>  
   
   <p>I got yours of the 4th instant, written on the back of Kennedy's,<sup><a href="#loc.03299_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> and meant to have written you long before, as well as after, but have been in a
      wretched condition with the "misery in my back," as the colored brother calls it.
      I don't improve in my back and legs as rapidly as I
      ought, and am nearly as lame and heavy as you are, but keep hoping.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have wanted to hear how you are, especially your eyes, which you don't mention.
      The
      state of your eyes worries  me more than anything else about you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Did you see the enclosed, cut from the <u>Nation</u>, from the
      great Italian fortnightly? The article must be a splendid one to bear such
      excerpting by the <u>Nation</u>!<sup><a href="#loc.03299_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> We
      tried to get the magazine through Brentano, but failed. It must make these fellows
      gnash their teeth to see this growing foreign appreciation.—Send the slip back
      some time when you are writing.
   </p>
   
   <p>I got a copy of Kennedy's pamphlet<sup><a href="#loc.03299_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> from him, and but for
      my bad condition would have written to him, which I will do yet. I cant help
      feeling that he skates on pretty thin ice sometimes, though he says many
      things which are quite undeniable.
   </p>
   
   <p>I had a letter from Grace Channing<sup><a href="#loc.03299_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> recently in which she
      says: "By the way, there is in the latest edition of Leaves of Grass a
      poem—'The City Dead-House'—which affects me I cannot tell you how
      powerfully. I never saw it before, and I think Walt has never written anything more
      divinely beautiful. Often as I have read it, I can't keep the tears out of my
      eyes."
   </p>
   
   <p>The Channings are all very happy in their new home at Pasadena in California. It
      appears to be a perfect Paradise
   </p>
   
   <p>Up to date, the New York publishers have uniformly refused to publish my Baconian reply to R.
      G. White, even at my expense!<sup><a href="#loc.03299_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Reason, Shakespearean
      hostility to the subject. This is a pretty note! I am now going to try Boston.
   </p>
   
   <p>The death of Mrs. Gilchrist deeply stirred me.<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r6">6</a></sup> I was just about
      to try to write to her when I saw the news of her decease.
   </p>
   
   <p>When you next write, tell me how your eyes are. I am really anxious to know.
      
   </p>

      Good bye.
      <br></br>Faithfully yours
      <br></br>W. D. O'Connor.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03299_n1">1. See Whitman's letter to
      O'Connor of . Kennedy's letter is
      undated.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03299_n2">2. The excerpt is not extant.
      Over the years, <em>The Nation</em> had published a number of
      negative comments on Whitman's poetry, most famously perhaps Henry James's
      scathing remarks on <em>Drum-Taps</em> (16 November 1865),
      625–626. Especially O'Connor had chosen the British periodical as his
      personal enemy, authoring rebuttals to a number of <em>Nation</em>
      reviews that he felt misrepresented the poet or his disciples.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03299_n3">3. William Sloane Kennedy's <em>The Poet as Craftsman</em>, a twenty-page pamphlet, was
      published by David McKay in 1885.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03299_n4">4. Grace Ellery Channing
      (1862–1937) was the daughter of William F. Channing and the niece of
      William D. O'Connor. After her initial refusal to ever read Whitman's work,
      Channing became enthralled by the poet's words and even published her own volume
      of Whitman-inspired poetry titled <em>Sea-Drift</em> in
      1899.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03299_n5">5. <em>Hamlet's
         Note-Book</em>. O'Connor understood his book as a "Baconian reply to R. G.
      White," a literary critic and scholar, who argued that Shakespeare was not a
      pseudonym of Francis Bacon but indeed a seperate, historic figure and author.
      After numerous publishers had declined O'Connor's manuscript, it was finally
      published in 1886 by Houghton, Mifflin and Company (Boston and New York).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0259">6. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
