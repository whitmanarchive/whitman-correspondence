      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd the $50 to-day all right,<sup><a href="#loc.01539_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> and a real help to me—I
      have money, but cannot have the use of it just now—so this comes first rate—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I spent yesterday down on the sea-shore—was all by myself—had a splendid good
      day—took my dinner with me—went down in the boat 12 miles in the morning, &amp;
      back in a big open horse car, toward evening, through the fields &amp; woods—very
      pleasant indeed—staid a long while in the water—weather perfect—Mother<sup><a href="#n0705" id="r2">2</a></sup> is
      better to-day—she has been pretty sick, with several ups &amp; downs—I am as
      well as a fellow can be—eat &amp; sleep tremendous—Shall stay here a week or so
      longer—shall be back first part of next week if nothing happens—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, Pete, I believe that is all this morning—Good bye, my darling son, and a long,
      long kiss from your loving father 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <p id="n0705">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
