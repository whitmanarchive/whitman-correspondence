   <p>I have sent to you the "Galaxy"; It contains two articles, one on Whitman and one
      on Swinburne,<sup><a href="#med.00330_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I have read both criticisms, with great satisfaction. Richard Grant White has but
      paid just sympathy to a true poet "Swinburne"; The criticism is a "Poem," in itself.
      It has the comprehensiveness, and the fearless recognition of the divine idea, or
      sentiment of "Love," as expressed by the Poet, he writes upon—Swinburne electrifies
      me. I read one verse of his "Laus Veneris," in a store, and bought the book—When critics
      or ordinary readers, or writers scribble him down, the Sun will cease to procreate
      and vitalize the earth. He is cultivated, and "passion" is his subject—"St Dorothy"
      is saddening, and the "Leper" oh how passionately full of piteous Love—and the "Orchard"
      oh! the night is all starrd by it, and earth burdend with dewy fragrancies—
   </p>  
   
   <p>There is enough beauty in your "Leaves" to make a rare book, and not cast out sensuous
      extravagance either. But you are wonderfully, woefully mistaken in the privileage you take of being merely savagely material, and consequently offensively vulgar—
      Han is much better than usual, and is continualy promising to write to her Mother.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a French-born
      landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman (1823–1890), Walt
      Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_96.html">Heyde, Charles Louis (1822–1892)</a>," <em>Walt
