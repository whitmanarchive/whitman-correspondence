      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am sitting in my room with my dear little grandson, the sweetest little fellow you
      ever saw, asleep beside me.<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r1">1</a></sup> Giddy<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r2">2</a></sup> and Norah<sup><a href="#n3006" id="r3">3</a></sup> (my 3d daughter) are gone into Durham to do some shopping. Bee is up in London on her way
      to Berne in Switzerland, where she has finally decided to complete her medical studies.
      Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r4">4</a></sup> is, I think, staying with Eustace Conway<sup><a href="#n3007" id="r5">5</a></sup> at Hammersmith just now. He has been spending a week at Brighton with Edward Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; his family—but I will leave him to tell his own news. We are lodging in this little
      village with its red-tiled roofs &amp; gray stone walls, lying among wooded hills, corn
      fields, meadows, and collieries on the banks of the Weir, for the sake of being near
      Percy &amp; his wife. He is superintending here the erection of some kilns for making
      the peculiar kind of basic firebricks needed in his dephosphorization process. Durham
      Cathedral, which was mainly built soon after the Norman conquest, is in sight, crowning
      a wooded hill that rises abruptly from the river-side. It looks as solid, majestic,
      venerable as the rocks &amp; hills—the interior is of wonderful grandeur &amp; beauty. When
      you enter one of these cathedrals you are tempted to say architecture is a lost art
      with us moderns so far as sublimity is concerned—except in vast engineering works.
      You would not dignify the Weir with the name of a river in America—it is no bigger
      than Timber Creek—but it winds about so capriciously through the picturesque little
      city as to make almost an island of the hill on which the castle &amp; cathedral stand
      &amp; to need three great solid stone bridges within a quarter of a mile of each other,
      &amp; with its steep wooded sides carrying nature right into the heart of the old town.
      But the rainy season (we have scarcely seen the sun since we have been in England
      &amp; I believe it is the same in France &amp; Italy) and the great depression in trade, especially
      the coal &amp; iron, which chiefly concerns this district, seem to cast a gloom over everything.
      There are whole rows of colliers' cottages in this village empty. Where they go to
      no one knows, but as soon as the collieries reopen they will all reappear. We often
      meet Colliers returning from work—they look as if they had just emerged from Hades,
      poor fellows—their faces black as soot—their lean, bowed legs bare—I believe the mines
      are hot here; they work with little on—but they are really the cleanest of all workmen,
      as they take a bath every night on their return before supping. The speech here is
      almost like a foreign tongue to any one from the south or middle of England. I wonder
      if you have yet read Dr. Bucke's book.<sup><a href="#loc.04211_n1" id="r7">7</a></sup> It is about the only thing I have read since my return. It suggests deeply interesting
      trains of thought.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wonder if you are at Camden, taking your daily trips across the ferry &amp; strolls
      up Chestnut St. I hardly realized till I left it how dearly I love America—great sunny
      land of hope and progress—or how my whole life has been enriched with the human intercourse
      I had there. Give my love to those of our friends whom you know &amp; tell them not to
      forget us. I have had a long letter from Emma Lazarus.<sup><a href="#n1052" id="r8">8</a></sup> I suppose Hattie<sup><a href="#n0911" id="r9">9</a></sup> and Jessie<sup><a href="#n1055" id="r10">10</a></sup> are spending their holidays at Camden &amp; that Hattie has pretty well done with school.
      We have been chiefly busy with needlework since we came—preparing dear Bee for Berne.
      I miss her sadly—had quite hoped we should have all been together at Paris this winter—but
      it seems the course is much longer &amp; more arduous [there]. We spent a week in Edinburgh
      before we came on here. It is by far the most beautiful city I have ever seen. The
      journey between it and Berwick-on-Tweed lies through the richest &amp; best cultivated
      farm land in Britain—the sea sparkling on one side of us &amp; these fertile fields dotted
      with splendid flocks &amp; herds—with large comfortable-looking farmhouses, &amp; here &amp; there
      an old castle; it was singularly enjoyable. How I have wished everywhere that you
      were with us to share the sight—and the best is that you would return home more than
      ever proud &amp; rejoicing in America. It is a land where humanity is having, and is going
      to have, such chances as never before. Giddy sends her love. Mine also &amp; to your brother
      &amp; sister. Good-bye, dear Friend.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0259">1. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0890">2. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r2">[back]

      Fitzmaurice, was the wife of Anne Gilchrist's son Percy Carlyle
      Gilchrist.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">4. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0141b">6. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="n1052">8. Emma Lazarus (1849–1887) was
      a writer and editor best known for "The New Colossus," a sonnet that appears on
      the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty. A two-volume collection of her poems was
      published in 1888, titled <em>The Poems of Emma Lazarus</em>
      (Boston; New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1888). Lazarus also advocated
      on behalf of Jewish refugees in New York. See Esther Schor, <em>Emma Lazarus</em> (New York: Schocken Books, 2006).<a href="#r8">[back]
