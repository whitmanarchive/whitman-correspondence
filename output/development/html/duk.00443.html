   <p>She walks better, about the house—cooked some potatoes for herself, shared with
      me. Mrs Church<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r2">2</a></sup> takes her a small piece of beef, twice a week, which strengthens her
      very much. I am quite poorly—grippe—attacks my stomach—yet I
      succeed in managing the
