   <p>Enclosed I send my piece in Thorndike Rice's just issued <u>Lincoln Reminiscences</u><sup><a href="#loc.04874_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I don't
      know whether you will want it—but I do know you like to have earliest copies
      of any thing. Should you print it, I leave the head-lines &amp; introductory to
      you—&amp; dont forget to give Rice's book the due credit. Should you print, I
      wish you would send me here 25 copies paper.
   </p>
   
   <p>—I am ab't as usual—just going to drive down 12 miles to visit a poor young
      fellow, Walter Borton,<sup><a href="#loc.04874_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> very low with consumption.
   </p> 
   <p>Love
      to Mrs. W. and the sister.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Talcott Williams
      (1849–1928) was associated with the New York <em>Sun</em>
      and <em>World</em> as well as the Springfield <em>Republican</em> before he became the editor of the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in 1879. His newspaper vigorously defended Whitman
      in news articles and editorials after the Boston censorship of 1882. For more
      information about Williams, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_108.html">Williams, Talcott (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
