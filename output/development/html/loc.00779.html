   <p>My honest thanks to you, Hugo,<sup><a href="#loc.00779_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> for your letter posting me up not only about yourself but about my dear boys, Fred,
      Nat Bloom<sup><a href="#loc.00779_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—always so welcome to me to hear personally or in any way any &amp; every item about them.
      Dear friend, the same evening I rec'd your letter, I saw in the New York papers (which
      get here about 5 every evening) the announcement of Charles Chauncey's death.<sup><a href="#loc.00779_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> When I went up to my room that night towards 11 I took a seat by the open window
      in the splendid soft moonlit night, and, there alone by myself, (as is my custom sometimes
      under such circumstances), I devoted to the dead boy the silent cheerful tribute of
      an hour or so of floating thought about him, &amp; whatever rose up from the thought of
      him, &amp; his looks, his handsome face, his hilarious fresh ways, his sunny smile, his
      voice, his blonde hair, his talk, his caprices—the way he &amp; I first met—how we spoke
      together impromptu, no introduction—then our easy falling into intimacy—he with his
      affectionate heart thought so well of me, &amp; I loved him then, &amp; love him now—I thought
      over our meetings together, our drinks &amp; groups so friendly, our suppers with Fred
      &amp; Charley Russell<sup><a href="#loc.00779_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp;c. off by ourselves at some table, at Pfaff's<sup><a href="#loc.00779_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> off the other end—O how charming those early times, adjusting our friendship, I to
      the three others, although it needed little adjustment—for I believe we all loved each other more than we supposed—Chauncey was frequently
      the life &amp; soul of these gatherings—was full of sparkle, &amp; so good, really witty—then
      for an exception he would have a mood come upon him &amp; right after the outset of our
      party, he would grow still &amp; cloudy &amp; up &amp; unaccountably depart—but these were seldom—then
      I got to having occasionally quite a long walk with him, only us two, &amp; then he would
      talk well &amp; freely about himself, his experiences, feelings, quite confidential, &amp;c.
      All these I resumed, sitting by myself.
   </p>
   
   <p>Hugo, that's the way I sat there Wednesday night till after midnight (the pleasant
      Virginia breeze coming up the Potomac) and certainly without what they call mourning
      thought of the boy.
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Hugo, you speak of your all remembering me and wish to see me, it would be happiness
      for me to be with you all, at one of your friendly meetings, especially at Fred's
      room,<sup><a href="#loc.00779_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> so pleasant, with its effect I remember of pictures, fine color, &amp;c. to have the
      delight of my dear boys' company &amp; their gayety &amp; electricity, their precious friendship,
      the talk &amp; laughter, the drinks, me surrounded by you all, (so I will for a moment
      fancy myself,) tumbled upon by you all, with all sorts of kindness, smothered with
      you all in your hasty thoughtless, magnificent way, overwhelmed with questions, Walt
      this, Walt that, &amp; Walt every thing. Ah, if one could float off to New York this afternoon.
      It is Sunday afternoon now, &amp; perhaps you are at this moment gathered at Fred's or
      at your house, &amp; having a good time.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you were at Charles Chauncey's funeral—tell me about it, &amp; all particulars
      about his death. When you write, tell.<sup><a href="#loc.00779_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00779_n1">1. See Whitman's letter from
      
      . Until the date of
      Chauncey's death is established, this letter cannot be dated precisely. In the
      absence of this information we have placed it next to the dated letter to
      Fritsch.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00779_n2">2. For "Fred" Gray and
      Nathaniel Bloom, see the letter from 
      .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00779_n3">3. See the letter from 
      . Since at this point
      Whitman noted in the draft: "reserve for Fred Gray," he probably intended to
      include the material in another letter.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>

   <p id="loc.00779_n5">5. Charles Pfaff had
      opened—about 1854—a restaurant on Broadway near Bleecker Street which shortly
      became a famed meeting place for literary and theatrical people. In "Pfaff's
      privy," as the wits described it, in the late 1850s, Henry Clapp was king and
      Ada Clare was queen of the bohemians(see "Letter from Walt Whitman to William D.
      O'Connor, 5 May 1867" and "Letter from Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 15
      September 1867," Miller, ed., <em> The Correspondence</em>,
      1:327–329 and 338–340). Here Whitman met writers like Howells,
      Stoddard, and Aldrich, editors like Garrison (see "Letter from Walt Whitman to
      William D. O'Connor, 15 September 1867," <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, 1:338–340) and John Swinton (see Whitman's letter
      from ), and eccentrics like Count
      Adam Gurowski (see his letter from ).
      "My own greatest pleasure at Pfaff's was to look on—to see, talk little,
      absorb," Whitman observed to Horace Traubel (<em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [New York: Rowman and Littlefield, 1961], 1:417). Here too
      his nonliterary friends like Fritsch also assembled for their "orgies."For
      accounts of the Pfaffian days, see William Winter, <em>Old
         Friends, Being Recollections of Other Days</em> (New York: Moffat, Yard,
      1909), 63–106; W. L. Alden, "Some Phases of Literary New York in the
      Sixties," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em>, 111, (1907–8),
      554–558; and Albert Parry, <em>Garrets and Pretenders: A
         History of Bohemianism in America</em> (New York: Covici, Friede, 1933),
      3–48.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00779_n6">6. Gray's father, Dr. John
      F. Gray, lived at 1 East Twenty-sixth Street.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00779_n7">7. Horace Traubel notes his
      difficulties in deciphering this draft letter—"it was so criss-crossed and
      interlined." Whitman could not remember the date: "I think it was in '63—about
      the same time as the other." When Horace Traubel finished reading this letter
      aloud, "Walt's eyes were full of tears. He wiped the tears away with the sleeve
      of his coat. Put on a make-believe chuckle" (<em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [New York: Rowman and Littlefield, 1961], 3:388).<a href="#r7">[back]
