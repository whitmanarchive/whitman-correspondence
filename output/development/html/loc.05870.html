      <br></br><br></br>My dear Friend —
      
   </p>
   
   <p>It was with much regret that we felt compelled to leave you in your sickness last
      week. We hold you in affectionate remembrance as we pass over the waters to England
      where once we hoped to have had your company. We beg that you will send us from  time to time as
      you feel able accounts of your health and of all that nearly concerns you concerns
      us also who love you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Our passage across the whole way has been nearly as smooth as a duck pond, and my
      health has been very much benefited by it.
   </p>
   
   <p>I bear your messages of love and remembrance to your many many friends in  London, who
      without my privileges of personal fellowship with you, honour and love you. I hope
      that the knowledge of this may often cheer and console you in hours of pain and
      weariness. Alys,<sup><a href="#loc.05908_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> my faithful secretary, joins me in the
      expression of the hearty affection with which I am always
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Your loving friend
      <br></br>R. Pearsall Smith

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
