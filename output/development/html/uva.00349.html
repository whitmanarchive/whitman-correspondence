      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I got Jeff's letter sending the money toward the soldiers' dinner—it was more than
      I asked for, &amp; was very good of them all<sup><a href="#uva.00349_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I have not had any trouble myself, worth mentioning—the dinner has been got up at
      my instigation—I have contributed handsomely—but they, (the Hospital steward, &amp;c.)
      have done the work.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I sent Han a handsome little volume of "Florence Percy's Poems,"<sup><a href="#uva.00349_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; $5 for a Christmas present. Sent it to-day. Poor Han—I suppose every such thing
      does her so much good—
   </p>
   
   <p>Don't you believe that fool Heyde lately wrote a long letter to Mr. Raymond,<sup><a href="#uva.00349_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> editor of the N. Y. Times—in it he said "Walt was a good fellow <em>enough</em>—<em>but</em>"—&amp; then he went on to run down Leaves of Grass, like the rest of 'em—
   </p>
   
   <p>The way I know is, Wm. O'Connor was invited by Raymond to come &amp; see him—&amp; he told
      O'Connor he had received a number of letters about that piece in the <em>Times</em> of Dec. 2, which I sent you. He said they all praised the piece, &amp; thanked him (Raymond)
      for printing it, except one he got from a fellow in Vermont who called himself Walt
      Whitman's relation—a brother in law, he believed—quite a good deal of stuff. Raymond
      seemed to think the man was either crazy or a fool, &amp; he treated the letter with contempt.
   </p>
   
   <p>I dont want you to write any thing about it, to Han, of course—only if she was here, we
      would tell her. The puppy thought I suppose that he could get his letter printed,
      &amp; injure me &amp; my book.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are likely to have a pleasant day for Christmas—when I next write I will tell you
      about the dinner—I must inform you that I have had a present of a beautiful knife,
      a real Rogers' steel, to-day from the Attorney General—Mother, $2 is for Nance<sup><a href="#uva.00349_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—you can give it to her in money, or any way you like—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, dear mother, this is Christmas eve, &amp; I am writing it in the office by gas light,
      so as it will be ready to go to-morrow—I have not heard since from Mrs. Grayson. Good
      night, mother dear.
   </p>

   <p id="uva.00349_n1">1. On , Jeff had sent $31 collected from
      employees at the Water Works: "Hope you wont be disappointed in the smallness of
      the amount." Evidently Walt Whitman had also written to William E. Worthen for
      funds (see Whitman's letter to his brother Jeff of 
      ), since Jeff
      noted that he had "sent letter to Worthen." See also Whitman's letter of , and "Letter
      from Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 1 January 1867" (Edwin Haviland
      Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–69], 1:305).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="uva.00349_n2">2. Elizabeth Chase Allen
      (1832–1911), one of the favorite nineteenth-century household poets, used
      the pseudonym Florence Percy. <em>Poems</em>, published in 1866 by
      Ticknor and Fields, includes her most famous poem, "Rock Me to Sleep." She
      married John Burroughs's friend, E. M. Allen, in October, 1866; she heartily
      disliked Walt Whitman (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931], 12). Hannah
      acknowledged receipt of the book in her letter to her mother on March 20, 1867
      (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and
      Special Collections Library).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="uva.00349_n3">3. Henry Jarvis Raymond
      (1820–1869) established the New York <em>Daily Times</em> on
      September 18, 1851. Raymond termed <em>The Good Gray Poet</em>
      "the most brilliant monograph in our literature" (Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs</em>, 35), and invited O'Connor to review <em>Leaves of Grass</em> on December 2 (see the letter from 
      . He later asked
      O'Connor to write for the <em>Times</em>; see "Letter from Walt
      Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 16 April 1867" (Miller, <em>Correspondence</em>, 1:324–325).<a href="#r3">[back]
