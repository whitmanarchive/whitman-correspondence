   <p>I have come up from White Horse, &amp; think of visiting you tomorrow Wednesday—towards
      the latter part of the afternoon. Will be then to supper. Have met Edward Carpenter
      of Brighton, England, &amp; have taken the liberty of inviting up to your house to spend
      a couple of hours—to be there at 6—I am keeping up well in health for me.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00168_n1">1. Walt Whitman had been
      with the Staffords from April 24 to 30, and Edward Carpenter was in Camden on
      May 1 (<em>The Commonplace Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). This was Whitman's first meeting with his fervid English
      admirer (see the letter from Whitman to Edward Carpenter of ). On , Carpenter wrote to Whitman about his intended visit: "I think
      there are reasons <em>why we should meet</em>. . . . What must be
      done—and what you have largely (for a foundation <em>entirely</em>) done—is to form a new organic centre for the thought
      growth of this age. All seemed clear to me at times, so simple, so luminously
      clear—I have no more doubt or trouble for myself—but then to <em>express</em> it: that is an endless business—a thing
      never finished." In <em>Days with Walt Whitman</em>, Carpenter
      erred in dating his visit May 2 ([New York: The Macmillan Company, 1908],
      3–4). A few days later he followed Whitman to Kirkwood, where he was
      charmed by the poet's naturalness among the earthy Staffords.<a href="#r1">[back]
