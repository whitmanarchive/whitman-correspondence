      <br></br><br></br>Dear Son Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Here I sit again by the heater in the parlor, writing my weekly letter—I have just
      had my dinner, some cold turkey &amp; glass of Missouri wine &amp;c.—had been out to the P.O.
      some five or six squares distant—but have to take my time—Am still getting along very
      satisfactorily (for I am now satisfied with things not 
      being <u>very</u> bad with me)—&amp; my strength is undoubtedly better, which, I hope
      will in time bring improvement in my walking, &amp; in my head, &amp;c &amp;c—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—The letter you spoke of about Penn. av. in the paper was not by me—In the Graphic
      of Tuesday last, Nov. 25, they print a portrait of my beautiful phiz. 
      &amp; a criticism on my books, one of the best &amp; friendliest I have seen yet<sup><a href="#loc.01624_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—if you can get one in Wash. you will like it—if not you may see it at Graphic office, 
      in Wash—I have not rec'd any.—Also Monday's, Nov. 24, <u>Graphic</u> prints my letter 
      about the Capitol<sup><a href="#loc.01624_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Your letter came Tuesday—As I said before, you seem to have done what was unavoidable
      
      in the Rives muss—but I have a horror of bar room fracases &amp; fights—&amp; I know you have
      too—As a general thing, I don't think it necessary to resent 
      the insults of drunkards or fools, (unless there is something unavoidable in the case)—
   </p>
   
   <p>—Did you get the <u>Scottish Chiefs</u><sup><a href="#loc.01624_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I sent? Good bye, my dear, loving boy—I am doing quite well—I hope this will find
      you feeling well in health &amp; jolly in spirits.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
