   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00613_n4">1. Walt Whitman wrote that he
      "had a slight stroke of paralysis" and was "not able to get up," but he added
      that he had "some very attentive friends" (see his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00613_n1">2. Walt befriended Peter Doyle
      (1843–1907), a horsecar conductor in Washington, around 1865. Though
      Whitman informed Doyle of his flirtations with women in their correspondence,
      Martin G. Murray affirms that "Whitman and Doyle were 'lovers' in the
      contemporary sense of the word." Doyle assisted in caring for Whitman after his
      stroke in January 1873. See Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00155.html">"Pete the Great: A Biography of Peter Doyle."</a><a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00613_n6">3. Walt Whitman visited Camden,
      New Jersey, from January 7–10, 1873 (see Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:191, n. 2).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00613_n5">4. Walt Whitman assured his
      mother that he would convey "the <em>exact truth—neither
         better nor worse</em>" (see his  letter). A week later he wrote that despite the doctor's
      assurance and his own confidence that he was improving he had to remain in bed
      because he could "not move yet without great difficulty" (see his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00613_n3">5. This letter dates to January
      30, 1873, which is consistent with the day of week, Thursday, and day of month,
      30, in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand at the end of the letter. Richard
      Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1873, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with
      Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:370). Louisa's letter acknowledges
      one from Walt Whitman, in which he wrote that he was confined to his room,
      unable to walk, and had "attentive friends" (see Walt's  letter to Louisa).<a href="#r5">[back]
