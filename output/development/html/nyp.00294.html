      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I write a line just to give an account of myself. I am well as usual, &amp; in good spirits.
      
      My Mother, brother George, &amp; all, are well. I came through finely on the RR. last
      Wednesday—&amp; found myself received very agreebly just as I crossed Jersey flats, approaching
      New York, 
      by an entire <em>change in the weather</em>—the distressing heat gone—&amp; in its place summer atmosphere, 
      of course, but moderate enough—which has continued every day since. I enjoy it all,
      home here, 
      day &amp; night—especially the nights—which are fine.
      
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hear that Wm Swinton<sup><a href="#nyp.00294_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> is here, from California. Your name was just mentioned on the editorial page 
      of last Saturday's (I believe Saturday's) <em>Tribune</em>.<sup><a href="#nyp.00294_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I have seen Mrs. Price, she is ill with asthma. 
      Her daughter Emily<sup><a href="#nyp.00294_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> has had a fine little baby boy, now about a month resident in this mad world—(I write
      about the baby for Nelly and Jenny)—My sister Martha &amp; the children have migrated
      from St. Louis 
      to St. Paul, (Iowa) for a few weeks. They are as well as usual.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am quite busy flying around—the printers &amp; stereotypers commence on my <em>immortal work</em> to-morrow—My dear, dear friend, I hope you are well &amp; in good spirits—I send you
      my love—also to Charles Eldridge, 
      if he is there—the package of letters &amp; paper came promptly—&amp; I will heartily thank
      you to continue 
      watching the letters &amp;c. and forwarding them to me in same manner—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Please enclose this in your next letter to Nelly—Nelly, my darling, I hope you are
      having comfortable times, 
      &amp; that all goes well—&amp; Jeannie too—I think often about you both—&amp; send you my best
      love—in which I am joined by my Mother.
      
   </p>
