      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:  
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was very glad to hear from this morning and hope to be able to write you soon <u>in extenso</u>. I have been very sick and feeble for a month
      past, but am a little better. My eye got open at last, but is still bleary and bad.
      My present woe is a festered pen finger, sore as death, and preventing me writing.
      Altogether, I am pretty used up. Tell Traubel.<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I feel dejected at your
      illness, but am comforted to know you are better. The bladder trouble is worst to
      think of. It is one of <u>my</u> afflictions, though without
      pain.—I will try to write soon.
   </p>
   
   <p>I deeply enjoyed your reminiscence of the elder Booth<sup><a href="#loc.03374_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> in <u>November
         Boughs</u>,<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r4">4</a></sup> and wish you had made it longer. He and Rachel<sup><a href="#loc.03374_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> were the only vast
      actors I ever saw.
   </p>

      Always affectionately

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="loc.03374_n2">3. The chapter "The Old Bowery"
      in <em>November Boughs</em> reminisces about the British actor
      Junius Brutus Booth (1796–1852), who rose to fame performing Shakespeare
      in New York. He was also the father of Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth
      (1838–1865).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">4. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="loc.03374_n3">5. Rachel Felix (1821–1858), known simply as "Mademoiselle Rachel," was a French actor
      who 
      joined the famous Comédie-Française theater in Paris when she was seventeen years
      old and quickly became 
      celebrated, as much for her scandalous love life as for her brilliant acting. She
      has been called the first international theater star. 
      O'Connor may have seen her on her tour of the United States in 1855. She was known
      for her remarkable ability to inhabit classical 
      roles (in plays by Voltaire, Corneille, and Racine) as fully living women, conveying
      their passions with great conviction. For further information, 
      see Rachel Brownstein, Tragic Muse: Rachel of the Comédie-Française (New York: Knopf,
      1993).<a href="#r5">[back]
