      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hardly know through what a malign series of crooked events—absence chiefly on my
      part in Italy &amp; Switzerland, pressure of studious work, &amp; miscarriage of letters—I
      should have failed to make earlier application to you for your new books.<sup><a href="#loc.04208_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> I do so now, however, begging you to send me copies of <u>Leaves of Grass</u> &amp; <u>Two Rivulets</u>,
      &amp; enclosing a Cheque on my bankers for £5. I see by Mr. Rossetti's<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r3">3</a></sup> Circular that the price of each volume is £1. If you will send me 2 copies of each,
      the other £1 will serve for postage. I shall then have copies for myself &amp; copies
      to give to a friend.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>May I ask that in one of
      
      the volumes at any rate your loved &amp; revered autograph may be found?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Some time since, my friend Roden Noel<sup><a href="#n0815" id="r4">4</a></sup> gave me by token of comradeship one of two photographs signed with your own name,
      wch you gave him. This is now framed &amp; hangs in my bedroom. I see it daily—opposite the
      similar signed photograph of Alfred Tennyson, 
      
      from whom as a boy I learned much. To me as a man your poems—yourself in your poems—has
      been a constant teacher &amp; loved companion.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I do not know whether you are likely to have heard that I make literature my daily
      work. I wait the time when I shall be able here in England to raise my voice with
      more authority than I yet have in bidding men to know you: for I feel that you have
      for us
      
      here in the old country a message no less valuable to us than to your own people.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I seem to know you as a friend &amp; father; &amp; those who love me best, make me gifts recalling
      you—like Roden Noel's I have mentioned, &amp; like that of a lady who some time since
      sent me a copy of Leaves of Grass
      
      Boston<sup><a href="#loc.04208_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> 1855.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>More than this I need not now write: unless it be to ask you whether, by way of remembrance,
      you would care to receive any works printed by me—echoes of my studies in the history
      of Greece &amp; Italy for the most part?<sup><a href="#n0816" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>

      I am with all love &amp; reverence yours
      <br></br>John Addington Symonds.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04208_n3">1. This letter is endorsed, in
      Whitman's hand: from J Addington Symonds | Jan 23 '77 | books sent April &amp;
      May, '77.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04208_n1">2. John Addington Symonds, a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was in his
      time most famous as the author of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>. But in the smaller circles of the emerging
      upper-class English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of
      homoerotic poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual
      inversion as it was then known (<em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 701).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">3. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0815">4. Roden Noel (1834–1894) was an
      English poet. Noel came from an aristocratic English family, and in his youth
      developed socialist sympathies. He was a close friend of the poet and
      influential critic Robert Buchanan, and it may have been through Buchanan that
      Noel first encountered <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In 1871 (the same
      year that he first wrote to Whitman). Noel published an essay entitled "A Study
      of Walt Whitman" in <em>The Dark Blue</em> (Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in England</em> [Ithaca, NY: Cornell University
      Press, 1934], 147–149).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04208_n2">5. The first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> was published not in Boston but in
      Brooklyn (1855). Whitman notes this error in his discussion of Symonds's letter
      with Horace Traubel (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906], 1: 459-460).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0816">6. Symonds is likely referring to his
      <em>Studies of the Greek Poets</em> (London: Smith, Elder,
      1876, 2 vols.) and <em>Renaissance in Italy</em> (London: Smith,
      Elder, 1886, 7 vols.)<a href="#r6">[back]
