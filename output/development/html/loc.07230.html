   <p>I am thinking of you a great deal in this lovely September weather, wondering how
      it
      is with you, dreaming of that September eight years ago when you were here. In
      another month I suppose we shall have the two books the "N.B."<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r2">2</a></sup> 
      and the "C.W."<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      Before that time or soon after it I may see you—all looks well for the meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      so far and I may be east a good deal looking after it. I wonder how it is we (at
      least, I) hear nothing these times of Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r5">5</a></sup> and his "Walt
      Whitman." I fear publishers are not smiling upon him—fifty years from now they would be glad
      enough to get it. I am hard at work on a paper or pamphlet or something or other on
      the same subject but goodness knows when it will see type—however nothing like
      pegging away—our turn will come some time I suppose since "every dog has his
      day"
   </p>
   
   <p>Let me hear from you when you feel up to it—it seems a long time since I saw
      your handwriting or the envelope of a letter
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all well and we all send love to you</p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      I am always affectionately yours

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07230_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: LONDON | AM | SP 3 | 88 | CANADA; CAMDEN, N.J. | SEP | 5 | 6AM |

         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">2. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">3. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07230_n2">4. Bucke and his brother-in-law
      William John Gurd were designing a gas and fluid meter to be patented in Canada
      and sold in England.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">5. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
