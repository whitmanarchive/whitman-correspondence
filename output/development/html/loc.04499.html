   <p>Am glad to see by a morning journal that you are well enough to undertake a visit
      to
      New York, and the delivery of your address on Lincoln.<sup><a href="#loc.02589_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      If you have no better place to go, I shall be happy to give you shelter under my
      roof no 15, East Seventy-fourth St, where I think you spent an hour some years ago.
      In any event, I hope to hear your address, and to see you at my office. I am anxious
      to have one or more contributions from you for my Cyclopedia for which we pay ten
      dollars, per printed page. Will you suggest some that you would like to write?
      Prospectus enclosed.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02589_n2">1. Whitman gave his Lincoln
      lecture at Madison Square Theatre in New York on April 14, 1887. James B. Pond
      recounts it as follows: "It was indeed a picturesque spectacle at Walt's last
      appearance in the Madison Square Theatre, on Lincoln's birthday. Just as he was
      about to recite 'My Captain,' a little girl, the granddaughter of Edmund
      Clarence Stedman, walked out upon the stage and presented him with a beautiful
      bouquet of roses" (<em>Eccentricities of Genius</em> [New York: G.
      W. Dillingham Co.], 497).<a href="#r1">[back]
