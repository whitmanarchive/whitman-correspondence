      Dr. Mitchell jr.<sup><a href="#loc.07644_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> to Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r3">3</a></sup> and
      forwarded me by the latter. This letter gives an acct of the analysis of your water
      and according to it your kidneys are <u>absolutely sound</u>.
      There is nothing at all wrong with your water works except the enlarged prostate and
      the irritation consequent upon it. Your main difficulty is that on account of the
      enlargement of the prostate the bladder is not entirely emptied at any
      time—the urine retained undergoes decomposition and causes
      irritation—now what is wanted is that a catheter should be passed morning and
      evening and <u>all</u> the water drawn
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>off (in this way) twice a day. This would have to be done by a doctor for a time but
      there is no reason whatever that 
      Warran
      
      <sup><a href="#loc.00668_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> should not learn to do it as well as any
      doctor after being instructed and provided with a proper catheter. I shall hope to
      hear that this matter is put upon a proper footing <u>at once</u>
      and after this is done I have every confidence that I shall hear of your being more
      comfortable than for a long time back.

   <p>All well here—glorious weather—but alas! our snow is gone and we have to
      use wheels again.

   <p>All quiet with the meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup>—too quiet! We do not get
      on nearly as fast as I should like but if we go slow I have 
      confidance
      
       that we are going <u>sure</u> and now that I am
      relieved about your kidneys I have good hopes you will be with us to have the "good
      time coming"

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07644_n2">2. During Dr. William
      Osler's absence, beginning on July 8, Whitman was attended by Dr. J. K.
      Mitchell, son of S. Weir Mitchell (see Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.102.html">Sunday, July 8, 1888</a>). For Whitman's opinion of the young man, see

   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="loc.00668_n4">4. Frederick Warren Fritzinger
      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,
      535).<a href="#r4">[back]
