   </p>
   
   <p>The long MS you sent me some months since is all right &amp; I will return it to you
      forthwith—The whole drift of it is lofty, subtle &amp; true—I would not
      put it <u>out by itself</u>—Such things never strike in so well in the
      abstract as in illustration, of <u>some definite
         personal, critical concrete thing.</u>—I suggest to you a criticism on <u>Tennyson and Walt Whitman</u> (or if you prefer on <u>Victor Hugo, T and WW</u>) where
      they should be work'd in—What think you?<sup><a href="#rut.00005_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="rut.00005_n1">1. On  Kennedy sent the manuscript of "The New
      Ars Poetica," in which he attempted to defend Whitman's poetic style. On  he accepted Whitman's suggestion of
      expanding his article. This essay became part of <em>The Poet as A
         Craftsman</em> (see the letter from Whitman to Kennedy of ).<a href="#r1">[back]
