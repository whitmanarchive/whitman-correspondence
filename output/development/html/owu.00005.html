      <br></br><br></br>Dear Brother Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We received your letter today and I feel as if you could not get me a room without
      a
      great deal of trouble I suppose as Congress is in session that every place is taken
      up. I was thinking perhaps I could stay the first night with Mrs O Conner<sup><a href="#duk.00436_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> as they have invited me to come, I could sleep with
      Jennie and the next day I will visit Masons<sup><a href="#loc.00445_n5" id="r2">2</a></sup> and if they
      should seem clever and ask me to stay with them I will do so. anyway dont bother
      about it for we will get some place after I get there. the only reason I would like
      to stop one night with Mr O Conner is that  I will get there in the evening and I
      have no doubt when I call on Masons they will insist on my staying with them
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother says she will not write this week. the draft came all right and when you write
      again send her some 
      envolopes
      
       she is about as well as usual some days quite lame.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I cant say the day I will come but will write again it will be some time next
      week
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Martha Mitchell Whitman (d. 1873) known as "Mattie,"
      was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and
      Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
      the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat
      ailment that would lead to her death in 1873.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00436_n3">1. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor
      was the wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Walt Whitman's
      staunchest defenders. Walt may have mentioned a potential visit by Nelly and her
      daughter during his May visit to Brooklyn, though whether a visit came near this
      time is not known from his or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters. Walt Whitman
      dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington years, and he spoke
      often in his letters of their daughter Jean (called "Jenny" or "Jeannie").
      Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break off their friendship in late
      1872 over a disagreement about Reconstruction policies and the role of
      emancipated slaves, Nelly would remain friendly with Whitman. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
