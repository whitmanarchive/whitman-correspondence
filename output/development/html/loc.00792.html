   <p>The noble gift of your brother Joseph P Davis of [$20?] for the aid of the wounded,
      sick, dying soldiers
      here came safe to hand—it is being sacredly distributed to
      them—part of it has been so already—I may another time give
      you special cases—I go every day or night in the hospitals a few
      hours—<sup><a href="#loc.00792_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>As to physical comforts, I attempt to have something—generally
      a lot of—something harmless &amp; not too expensive to go round to
      each man, even if it is nothing but a good home-made biscuit to each
      man, or a couple of spoonfuls of blackberry preserve, I take a ward or
      two of an evening &amp; two more next evening &amp;c—as an
      addition to his supper—sometimes one thing, sometimes another,
      (judgment of course has to be carefully used)—then, after such
      general round, I fall back upon the main thing, after all, the special
      cases, alas, too common—those that need special attention, some
      little delicacy, some trifle—very often, far above all else,
      soothing kindness wanted—personal magnetism—poor boys, their
      sick hearts &amp; wearied &amp; exhausted bodies hunger for the
      sustenance of love or their deprest spirits must be cheered up—I
      find often young men, some hardly more than children in age yet—so
      good, so sweet, so brave, so decorous, I could not feel them nearer to
      me if my own sons or young brothers—Some cases even I could not
      tell any one, how near to me, from their yearning ways &amp; their
      sufferings—it is comfort &amp; delight to me to minister to them,
      to sit by them—some so wind themselves around one's heart, &amp;
      will be kissed at parting at night just like children—though
      veterans of two years of battles &amp; camp life—
   </p>
   
   <p>I always carry a haversack with some articles most
      wanted—physical comforts are a sort of basis—I distribute
      nice large biscuit, sweet-crackers, sometimes cut up a lot of peaches
      with sugar, give preserves of all kinds, jellies, &amp;c. tea, oysters,
      butter, condensed milk, plugs of tobacco, (I am the only one that doles
      out this last, &amp; the men have grown to look to me)—wine,
      brandy, sugar, pickles, letter-stamps, envelopes &amp; note-paper, the
      morning papers, common handkerchiefs &amp; napkins, undershirts, socks,
      dressing gowns, &amp; fifty other things<sup><a href="#loc.00792_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I have lots of special little requests. Frequently I
      give small sums of money—shall do so with your brother's
      contribution—the wounded are very frequently brought &amp; lay
      here a long while without a cent. I have been here &amp; in front 9
      months doing this thing, &amp; have learned much—two-thirds of the
      soldiers are from 15 to 25 or 6 years of age—lads of 15 or 16 more
      frequent than you have any idea—seven-eighths of the Army are
      Americans, our own stock—the foreign element in the army is much
      overrated, &amp; is of not much account anyhow—As to these
      hospitals, (there are dozens of them in [&amp;] around Washington)
      [there] are no hospitals you must understand like the diseased
      half-foreign collections under that name common at all times in
      cities—in these here, the noblest, cleanest stock I think of the
      world, &amp; the most precious.<sup><a href="#loc.00792_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William S. Davis, a
      lawyer in Worcester, Massachusetts, acting upon instructions from his brother
      Joseph, who was in Peru, sent Jeff $50 for Walt Whitman's hospital work. On , Jeff advised Whitman to
      acknowledge the gift and to describe his hospital work: "I consider it an
      opportunity for you to make this $50 the father of 100's without in the least
      seeming like one asking for it." Joseph returned from Peru in 1865, and he went
      with Jeff later to St. Louis; see Walt Whitman's letter to William D. O'Connor
      from May 5, 1867 (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:327–329). The brothers were descendants of a distinguished Massachusetts
      family. See also John Davis Estabrook, <em>Three Generations of
         Northboro Davises, 1781–1894</em> (Westboro, Massachusetts:
      Chronotype, 1908), 35–36; and E. A. Davis, <em>Eager-Davis
         Genealogy</em> (1859).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00792_n100">1. The letter is endorsed,
      "Sent Oct 1 1863 | to W S Davis | Worcester | Massachusetts." Draft
      Letter.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00792_n3">2. According to Whitman's
      notations, the material in this paragraph up to this point was to have been
      incorporated into the preceding paragraph. Since there are no indications in the
      manuscript as to where he intended to place it, the document has been
      transcribed literally.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00792_n4">3. When Horace Traubel read
      this letter aloud on May 23, 1888, Whitman commented: "Sometimes I am myself
      almost afraid of myself—afraid to read such a letter over again: it carries me
      too painfully back into old days—into the fearful scenes of the war. I don't
      think the war seemed so horrible to me at the time, when I was busy in the midst
      of its barbarism, as it does now, in retrospect" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Rowman and
      Littlefield, 1961], 1:198).<a href="#r3">[back]
