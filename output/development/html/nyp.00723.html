   <p>I have had a pretty good week so far—am either throwing off (or easying) some of the
      worst bad subjections and <em>grips</em>—
   </p>
   
   <p>My big book<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r2">2</a></sup> (collection of all) is all printed, &amp; paid for &amp; at the binders delaying for one
      or two little things—it is nothing more than 
      you have seen—but I had a great desire for <em>all</em> to be combined, comprehended at one glance—and here it is—of course I shall
      send you a copy—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am sitting yet in my sick room now in my usual big chair by the oak wood fire, &amp;
      alone. I have plenty visitors enough &amp; good ones—my appetite
      &amp; sleep are fair—I have a new helper<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; nurse, a clean strong kind hearted young Kanuck man<sup><a href="#nyp.00723_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r5">5</a></sup> sent me—All indeed goes as well &amp; 
      comfortable as could be expected with me—And how with you? I think of you every day—&amp;
      most all my friends coming here ask ab't you—I rec'd the letter 
      last week<sup><a href="#nyp.00723_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; thankful &amp; ask for more—I cannot say I enthuse on H[arrison]'s election<sup><a href="#nyp.00723_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup>—but I accept it—all right for what it goes—Dr. B. is probably
      coming this way in a week—Best love to you &amp; to Nelly.<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r8">8</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00723_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Wm D O'Connor | 1015 O Street | Washington D C. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. |
      Nov 9 | 8 PM | 88; Washington, Rec'd. | Nov 10 | 7 30 AM | 88 | 3.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">2. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">3. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r3">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]

      Whitman of .<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00723_n3">7. Whitman was referring to the
      recent election of the Republican lawyer and politician Benjamin Harrison
      (1833–1901) as the 23rd President of the United States. Harrison defeated
      the Democratic incumbent Grover Cleveland in the 1888 election, and served as
      President from 1889 to 1893.<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="n4137">8. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
