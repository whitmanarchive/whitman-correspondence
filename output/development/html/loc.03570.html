      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I got your second letter yesterday, forwarded here from Dresden.<sup><a href="#loc.03570_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Don't be uneasy
      about the English text in the translation. I <u>fully</u> see the
      advantages of it. I have mentioned it in my preface. Only as I had had no opinion
      on
      the subject from anyone in the publishing line I didn't know what they might not  have to advance
      so did not like to speak too decisively about it. I should not have given you to
      understand that a publisher's mere <u>opinion</u> would weigh with me, for it would not. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Now as to progress made—I have met with difficulties more serious than I expected.
      The
      work is ready, &amp; could go to the printer any day. But the printer is not equally
      ready for the work. I offered it to four publishers before I left Germany, agreeing
       to pay all
      expenses myself, &amp; all refused to take it up. I sent with my M.S. a copy of
      Freiligrath's article,<sup><a href="#n0248" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; did all I could to secure a favourable hearing, but in
      vain. I am told there would probably be difficulties with the police, who in Germany
      exercise a most despotic power. Then other publishers I thought of trying are, I have
      been informed, rogues; and others again are dependent in various ways on court or
      official patronage—others would'nt touch it with it the end of a poker. So finally
      I
      came to a resolution a good deal  confirmed by what you said of the probable circle of readers of
      the first edn—namely, to let the book appear in America, &amp; <u>thence</u> make its way into German circulation. Once in print
      &amp; fairly before the public it will of course weather every storm, but the thing
      is to get it fairly started. Had I been living in Germany longer I should have tried
      selling the book myself—but that I can't do from here. Now in America, where
      your position is assured, I suppose some German publisher would take it up readily
      enough. 
      
      I am going then to ask you to take what steps can be taken toward finding a willing
      publisher with some German connection. No doubt Dr Karl Knortz<sup><a href="#uva.00476_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> would a useful person to
      apply to. (If you know him, &amp; could get him to glance through my proof sheets I
      don't doubt that the work would be considerably improved.) 
   </p>
   
   <p> As to terms, of course if any enterprising
      publisher would give me 100 dollars or so for the book I would let him have it (it
      being understood that you &amp; I should have our way about the form of the book,
      English version, &amp;c). But I would  be willing also to bear the expenses &amp; keep the copyright, if the
      former were not out of the way large—I suppose it would cost a good deal more in
      America than in Germany, where everything is very cheap, &amp; I have not much ready
      money to spare now. But I think I can rely on my father's helping me to the extent
      needed. If the book is printed in America you will be able to oversee technical
      matters connected with the printing to your own satisfaction. 
   </p>
   
   <p> So the upshot of this is that I will
      send you my M.S. as soon as it  reaches me (it is coming in a box which was sent after me via
      Hamburg with other heavy luggage), &amp; you can do as you think well with it. Let me
      say again that I should greatly like the proofsheets, before coming here, to pass
      through the hands of some German scholar <u>who knows the L. of
         G.</u> &amp; should be grateful for any annotations he might wish to make. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I was grieved to hear of your increased illness. It is very hard to be persecuted
      by
      such things when you ought to have peace and freedom. But I  know how you are 'armed with
      patience' Silence is a great comforter. 
   </p>
   
   <p> We are now back in our own country for good, &amp; are greatly delighted to be so.
      The people are much more congenial to me than Germans, though these latter are more
      so than English. I was born in this house &amp; know every field &amp; nearly every tree since
      my
      childhood, it is wonderfully beautiful to me—a rich, undulating wooded
      land—deep grass &amp; crops, blue mountains of Slieve Bloom on the horizon,
      &amp; the stateliest trees, mostly ash &amp; beech, I ever saw. I have a great love
      for ash trees—such sinewy strength, &amp; a free, powerful method of branching,
      showing through the light foliage. What a country  this is! or would be but for
      savage misgovernment, and Protestant bigotry. The Orangemen in the north are a source
      of much
      evil, &amp; will be of more, unless some miracle should turn them into human
      sympathetic Irishmen. There was a time when I thought that Ireland could never be
      set free from English rule because the Catholic Church would instantly become
      dominant and inaugurate a system of religious tyranny which would crush liberties
      more important than <u>national</u> liberties. Now I begin to see
      that this would not be so for long. The Irish are much less Catholic than they were—dogmatic
      religion is loosening its hold
      upon them in a very remarkable way, &amp; hatred for  Protestant England as Irelands ruler is a most potent cause at
      present in supporting the Catholic religion here. This is felt even by the more
      cultivated &amp; farseeing of the clergy, who consequently oppose the national
      movement as far as they dare. I have no doubt that in a free Ireland the Church would
      persecute as naturally as a 
      wasp stings, but I am equally certain that a revulsion of feeling would come which
      (though attended
      perhaps with terrible struggles) would mark a real moral &amp; intellectual advance
      such as seems out of our reach at present. The people about us here are very poor,
       reckless,
      friendly "full of reminiscences" both of good &amp; evil. My father is greatly loved
      far &amp; wide because when County Court Judge of Tipperary he protected the tenants
      as far as the laws allowed against the rapacity of the landlord class. He is a man
      you would like to see! He is over 70 now, more than average height even for our
      family, where the men grow very tall—(about 6 ft 4 inches)—&amp; still sturdy. At
      present he is suffering form a strain got a few days ago while riding a restive
      horse. They tell me that a few days before I came there was a storm, and a fine
      sycamore  he was
      fond of, near being blown down—they saw the roots heaving through the loosened
      earth—and my father sat down upon them until heavy weights could be brought to keep
      them down till the storm blew out, a device which was perfectly successful. 
      He &amp; my mother are greatly delighted with the two grandchildren we have brought
      them home. I'll send you a photograph of them soon, which has been done in Dresden
      just before we left. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I will leave the poems arranged in the order I find best but you of course may wish
      to alter my arrangement, in which case I shall have nothing to object. 
   </p>
   
   <p> —I couldn't make out what '<u>teff wheat</u>' is—(Salut au Monde)—is there a German
      equivalent? I have written Teff-Weizen.<sup><a href="#loc.03570_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="n0248">2. Ferdinand Freiligrath (1810–1876) was a German
      poet and translator and friend of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In his  letter to Rudolf Schmidt, Whitman
      wrote that Freiligrath "translates &amp; commends my poems." His review in the
      Augsburg <em>Allgemeinen Zeitung</em> on April 24, 1868 (reprinted
      in his <em>Gesammelte Dichtungen</em> [Stuttgart: G. J. Göschen,
      1871], 4:86–89), was among the first notices of Whitman's poetry on the
      continent. A translation of the article appeared in the <em>New
         Eclectic Magazine</em>, 2 (July 1868), 325–329; see also Gay Wilson
      Allen, <em>Walt Whitman Abroad</em> (Syracuse: Syracuse University
      Press, 1955), 3–7. A digital version is available in Walter Grünzweig's
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/german/introduction.html">Whitman in the German-Speaking Countries</a>," which collects several
      examples of German reception of Whitman's poetry. Freiligrath had promised his
      readers "some translated specimens of the poet's productions," not a complete
      translation. William D. O'Connor and Whitman were applying pressure. A
      sympathetic article on Whitman in the New York <em>Sontagsblatt</em> of November 1, 1868, mentioned Freiligrath's admiration
      for the American poet. A translation of this article, which Whitman had a
      Washington friend prepare, is now in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="uva.00476_n1">3. Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
