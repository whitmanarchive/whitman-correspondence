   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of yesterday rec'd—Also the previous ones<sup><a href="#upa.00188_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I keep well—no attack of the neuralgia-rheumatism so far this spring—So I fancy it
      has skipp'd me—havn't been down to Kirkwood since early in Dec: last—the Staffords have no doubt moved—Harry
      comes up about once a month to see me—I expect to come on to N Y to lecture (Death
      of Abraham Lincoln) the middle of April—Do you know of my friend Mr Johnston, jeweler,
      150 Bowery? he is sort of engineering it—in conjunction [with] John Burroughs, (now
      in Washington)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My brother &amp; sister well—her sister<sup><a href="#upa.00188_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; two children staying with us this spring—the charmingest, fattest, lovingest, cunningest
      little five year old girl, with the sweet name of Amy<sup><a href="#upa.00188_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I dont know where I shall go this summer, but must strike off somewhere—Well pleased with
      the prospect of seeing you &amp; all, in Phila:—Love to Herb and to Giddy—I shall now
      go over the ferry, &amp; post this in the Phil: Office—return leisurely to C[amden] before
      dark—
   </p>

      So long, dear friend—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00188_n1">1. The year is established
      by the reference to the Lincoln lecture on April 14.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00188_n2">2. Anne Gilchrist wrote five
      letters to Whitman in 1879 before he replied: on January 5, 14, and 27, and on
      March 18 and 26. After moving from Massachusetts to New York, Gilchrist wrote
      frequently and impatiently to Whitman. She wanted him to come to see her. "Are
      you never coming?" she asked on .
      "I do long &amp; long to see you" (<em>The Letters of Anne
         Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Thomas B. Harned [New York: Doubleday,
      Page &amp; Company, 1918], 171). Whitman did not hurry—he never did when
      he was importuned—and he arrived in New York on April 9.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00188_n3">3. Emma Dowe (see the letter
      from Whitman to Emma Dowe of ). Her
      arrival in Camden was noted in Whitman's Commonplace Book on March 6 (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00188_n4">4. Whitman sent Amy H. Dowe
      a valentine on February 14 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Amy taught school in
      Norwich, Connecticut, from 1912 until 1918, when she moved to Philadelphia with
      her father.<a href="#r4">[back]
