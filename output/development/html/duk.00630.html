   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

<div class="editorial_notes">
   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00630_n4">1. This letter dates to April
      3, 1873. Richard Maurice Bucke dated this letter only to spring 1873. Edwin
      Haviland Miller dated it April 3?, 1873 (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:210, n. 52; 2:370). Miller's date is correct. Walt Whitman enclosed a <em>New York Graphic</em> with his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Louisa's letter
      acknowledges Walt's letter and "the graphic," and she responds to Walt's query
      about the names of two sisters of his maternal grandmother. In Walt's  reply to this letter, he acknowledged
      Louisa's suggestion on the "galvanic battery for panalasis [<em>sic</em>]" by conveying his conversations with his physician Dr.
      Drinkard.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00630_n1">2. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's word "lillies" probably refers to a letter, i.e., Lillie's letter,
      that Walt Whitman enclosed from the cousin.<br><br>
      Louisa received Walt Whitman's  letter. Walt enclosed a copy of the <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_titles/per.00107.html"><em>New York Daily Graphic</em></a>, a tabloid
      newspaper published from 1873 to 1889. Walt published four poems in the
      periodical during March 1873, and he may have enclosed the March 24, 1873
      issue, which included his poem  with his  letter.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00630_n8">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      April 1, 1873 letter to Walt Whitman is not extant, but he acknowledged
      receiving her letter (see Walt's 
      letter to Louisa).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00630_n9">4. Priscilla or Lillie (Mead)
      Townsend was probably Walt Whitman's second cousin, the daughter of Sally
      (Williams) Mead, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's aunt. Priscilla's husband James H.
      Townsend was a clerk in the New York "Hall of Records." Sally (Williams) Mead
      and Phoebe (Williams) Pintard were sisters of Walt Whitman's maternal
      grandmother Naomi or Amy Williams (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:210, n. 52; Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 596).
      Louisa was responding to a question from Walt, "What is Aunt Sally's
      name—is it <em>Sarah Pintard</em>"? (see his  letter to Louisa). These
      letters from relatives were probably prompted by the report of Walt's stroke in
      the <em>New York Herald</em> (see Louisa's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00630_n14">5. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      appears to name Maggy/Maggie (Mead?) Tripp as Priscilla (Mead) Townsend's
      sister. Maggie Tripp is otherwise unknown. Walt also mentioned the letters he
      had received from relatives, including Maggie Tripp, Priscilla Townsend, and
      Sally Pintard, in his  letter to
      Louisa.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00615_n6">6. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
      Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
      Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
      frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
      the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00628_n15">7. The "aunt" who was engaged
      to assist Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, George Washington Whitman's wife, has not
      been identified but is probably named Elizabeth. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      described her daughter-in-law Louisa Orr's aunt as English and was not fond of
      the aunt's company. She is named "aunt Lib" and "aunt Libby" in Louisa's  and  letters to Walt.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00630_n5">8. Nineteenth-century cookbooks
      name a wide variety of recipes Indian Cakes, usually to designate a pan-fried
      cake with a high proportion of finely ground corn meal or seeds to wheat flour.
      It is unlikely that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman refers to a pure cornmeal batter
      (called "johnnycakes" when fried) because George Washington Whitman returned
      from his imprisonment at Andersonville with a sample of "corn bread" as an
      oddity (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">9. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00630_n13">10. The following week Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman was more forthright about the possibility that Louisa Orr
      Haslam was pregnant, though Louisa Van Velsor Whitman doubted Louisa Orr was
      pregnant in fact. Her daughter-in-law, she wrote, is "in the family way they
      think so still," and she continued, "they wont let her hardly move yesterday she
      dident come down stairs all day monday)" (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n6">11. Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975), 10–11.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00630_n16">12. The "letter of tuesday"
      refers to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's April 1, 1873 letter to Walt Whitman. Her
      letter is not extant, but Walt acknowledged receipt of the letter (see his  letter to Louisa).<a href="#r12">[back]
