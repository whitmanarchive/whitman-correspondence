      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>According to announcement in my last, I have made a movement &amp; change of base,
      from tumultuous, close-packed, world-like N. Y., to this half-rural, brisk,
      handsome, New England, third-class town. I came on here last Thursday. I came as
      guest of Thomas Davis, formerly M. C. from this city—arrived between 8 and 9
      o'clock at night—found his carriage at the depot waiting for me—at the
      house (a sort of castle built of stone, on fine grounds, a mile &amp; a half from
      the town) a hearty welcome from his hospitable wife, &amp; a family of young ladies
      &amp; children—a hot supper, a tip-top room &amp;c. &amp;c.—so you see,
      Pete, your old man is in clover. I have since been round the city &amp; suburbs
      considerably. I am going down to Newport before I return. Invitations &amp;c. are
      numerous. I am, in fact, already dividing myself between two hospitalities, part of
      the time with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Davis, and part with Dr. &amp; Mrs. Channing, old
      acquaintances of mine in another part of the city. I stopt last night at the house
      of the latter. It is on a high &amp; pleasant hill at the side of the city, which it
      entirely overlooks. From the window of my room, I can look down across the city, the
      river, and off miles upon miles in the distance. The woods are a real spectacle,
      colored with all the rich colors of autumn. Yesterday it was beautiful &amp; balmy
      beyond description, like the finest Indian summer. I wandered around, partly
      walking, partly in a carriage, a good part of the day. To-day there is an entire
      change of scene—As I sit writing this—what do you think,
      Pete?—great flakes of <em>snow</em> are falling, quite a thick
      flurry—sometimes the wind blows gusts—in fact a real snow storm has been
      going on all the forenoon, though without the look or feeling of actual winter as
      the grass &amp; foliage are autumnal, &amp; the cold is not severe yet. Still it
      [is] disagreeable &amp; wet &amp; damp &amp; prevents me from going out. So I will
      make it up by writing a couple of letters—one to mother,<sup><a href="#loc.01591_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; one to you,
      telling you about things. Providence is a handsome city of about 70,000
      inhabitants—has numerous manufactories in full operation—every thing
      looks lively. From the house up here, I can hear almost any time, night or day, the
      sound of factory bells &amp; the steam whistles of locomotives half a mile distant.
      Then the lights at night seen from here make a curious exhibition. At both places
      I
      stop, we have plenty of ripe fresh fruit and lots of flowers. Pete, I could now send
      you a bouquet every morning, far better than I used to, of much choicer flowers. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And how are you getting along, dearest comrade? I hope you are well, &amp; that every
      thing is going on right with you. I have not heard from you for a good while, it
      seems.<sup><a href="#loc.01591_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I suppose
      you got my last letter, 14th, from N. Y. I expect to return to N. Y. about the 22d.
      Should you feel to write after receiving this, you might direct to 331 East 55th st.
      as before. I am well as usual. I am luxuriating on excellent grapes. I wish I could
      send you a basket. At both places I stop they have vineyards, &amp; the grapes are
      very good &amp; plenty this year. Last night, when I went up at 11 o'clock to my
      room, I took up three great bunches, each as big as my fist, &amp; sat down and eat
      them before I turned in. I like to eat them this way, &amp; it agrees with me. It is
      quite a change here from my associations &amp; surroundings either in Washington or
      New York. Evenings &amp; meal times I find myself thrown amidst a mild, pleasant
      society, really intellectual, composed largely of educated women, some young, some
      not so young, every thing refined &amp; polite, <em>not</em> disposed
      to small talk, conversing in earnest on profound subjects, but with a moderate
      rather slow tone, &amp; in a kind &amp; conciliatory manner—delighting in this
      sort of conversation, &amp; spending their evenings till late in it. I take a hand
      in, for a change. I find it entertaining, as I say, for novelty's sake, for a week
      or two—but I know very well that would be enough for me. It is all first-rate,
      good &amp; smart, but too constrained &amp; bookish for a free old hawk like me. I
      send you my love, dear Pete. <em>So long</em>. Will write from N. Y.
      soon as I return there.

   <p>P.S. Just after 12 o'clock—noon—as I am just finishing, the storm
      lightens up—I am sure I see a bit of blue sky in the clouds—yes,
      the sun is certainly breaking out.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
