      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been wishing to write you for some days, but I have been away so much lately
      that it did seem as if I never would get time<sup><a href="#yal.00087_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Walt, I wrote Mother a long, long letter giving as near as I could the particulars
      about dear Matties death<sup><a href="#yal.00087_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I hope and suppose that they sent it to you and that it is not necessary therefore
      for me to re-state it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Walt this has been and is a heavy blow to me &nbsp;I was so much with her and we were
      so in each others confidences that it leaves me very lonly
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think Hattie has written to you about how we have broken up and are now living at
      Mr Bulkleys<sup><a href="#yal.00087_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &nbsp;It is by far the best thing for us all—Mrs Bulkly was a particular friend of Matties
      and liked her much—she likes the children and takes good care of them—I could not
      very well continue to keep house without stopping Hattie's schools and I did not wish
      to do that—but I shall not sell my things but pack them away as I best may and hope
      as soon as Hattie gets a couple of years older we will try again
   </p>
   
   <p>Well my dear Walt how is it with you—you have been and I fear are yet—sick &nbsp;I hope—sincerely
      hope that you are getting better now—you must take good care of yourself and not attempt over exertion
      &nbsp;From what I have heard it is a terrible sickness—and one that is apt to discourage—Dear
      Walt I hope you will get all right again soon
   </p>
   
   <p>I have had to go to Jefferson City—for some three or four days—and last week was at
      Kansas City<sup><a href="#yal.00087_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—. I have been engaged to make a plan of water works for Kansas City<sup><a href="#yal.00087_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> and shall have to go up there again in eight or ten days
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr Lane<sup><a href="#yal.00087_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> came down from Millwaukee to the funeral—I was exceeding glad to see him as he was so kind and sympathetic
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When you can Dear Walt write to me—you must not accuse me of not thinking or wondering
      about you—I have often thought how I would like to see you and if I can so arrange
      my work shall come on to do so
   </p>
   
   <p>For a few days before her death Mattie talked a great deal about you and Mother &nbsp;She
      wanted to see you both once more and at one time thought she would try to do so &nbsp;poor
      child she little knew how soon she would be free from her pains
   </p>
   
   <p>Love to you dear brother and I hope you will be able to come out and see me soon—do
      you not think it would do you good.
   </p>
   
   <p>I think I could make you enjoy yourself.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00087_n1">1. On March 9 hattie wrote
      to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman that "Papa will never write a letter &nbsp;he makes me
      write all the letters" (Walt Whitman Papers [Walt Whitman Papers], Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00087_n2">2. See Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00087_n3">3. For the Bulkleys, see
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from . The specific letter Jeff refers
      to is not known; however, on March 14 Hattie wrote to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      that the family had moved to Bulkley's on Saturday, March 8, and that "Papa has
      a very nice room but I sleep with Minnie Bulkley a young lady about sixteen
      years old" (Walt Whitman Papers). Hattie does not mention what arrangements were
      made for Jessie.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00087_n4">4. Jeff disliked having to
      leave his daughers so soon after Mattie's death. Hattie's letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman of March 14 notes that "Papa gave me a present of a most
      beautiful diamond ring &nbsp;it is perfectly elegant &nbsp;it has 4 splendid diamonds and
      five emeralds and he gave me a git [gilt?] necklace and cross and a black locket
      with six pearls and he gave Jessie a plain gold ring. &nbsp;I told him that I never
      got so many presents at once before &nbsp;I dont know what he did it for but I
      suppose he gave them to me because he was sorry he was going away" (Walt Whitman
      Papers).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00087_n5">5. Kansas City, Missouri,
      was planning a new waterworks at this time. Jeff may have submitted one of the
      two propositions the city rejected in the spring of 1873.<a href="#r5">[back]
