   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00548_n14">1. This letter dates to July
      15, 1868. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter only "wensday," and Richard
      Maurice Bucke assigned the date July 15, 1868. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with
      Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–75], 2:361). July 15, 1868, was a
      Wednesday, and the date assigned by Bucke is correct because it corresponds with
      stories about politics in the newspaper and because Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      replied directly to a query in Walt Whitman's most recent letter. The letter
      refers to the Democratic presidential candidate Horatio Seymour, and Louisa drew
      from an article in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, which
      appeared on July 7. She responded to Walt Whitman's request for her (and George
      Washington Whitman's) opinion of the Democratic ticket in Walt's  letter.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00548_n17">3. The house was probably the
      one on 1149 Atlantic Avenue. Louisa had discussed George Washington Whitman's
      difficulty in locating a surveyor and his progress on the cellar in her  letter. George purchased the property
      outright from his partner—a man named Smith—and Louisa and her son
      Edward moved there in late September (see her  letter to Walt Whitman and his  letter to Peter Doyle).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00548_n1">4. George Washington Whitman
      started a business building houses on speculation with a man named Smith in
      1865, and they were joined by a mason named French the following year. Walt
      Whitman described Smith as "a natural builder and carpenter (practically and in
      effect) architect," and he advised John Burroughs that Smith was an "honest,
      conscientious, old-fashioned man, a man of family . . . . youngish middle age"
      (see Walt's  letter to
      Burroughs). See also Jerome F. Loving, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> (Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975), 3–35.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00548_n2">5. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26. Mattie's June 8, 1868 letter may be the
      most recent one that Louisa has received (see Waldron, 54–56).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n5">6. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided
      in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a
      French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for
      his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00548_n15">7. Horatio Seymour
      (1810–1886), former governor of New York, was the Democratic Party nominee
      and opponent of Republican candidate Ulysses S. Grant in the presidential
      election of 1868. "Seymour among the People" reported enthusiastic crowds for
      the candidate along the train route for his return to Utica, New York (<em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, July 14, 1868, 2). The term
      "Radical" was the Democratic-leaning <em>Eagle</em>'s party
      designation for Republican candidates and voters, and it reserved terms like
      "respectable" and "respectful" for moderate Republicans who advocated generous
      terms for the southern states and so would consider voting for Seymour. For more
      on Seymour, see Joel H. Silbey, "Seymour, Horatio," <em>American
         National Biography Online</em>.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00548_n3">8. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's support for Ulysses S. Grant and the Republican presidential
      ticket was genuine. Walt Whitman had been employed in the office of the
      attorney general for a Republican president, and his brother George
      Washington Whitman served in the Union Army. Louisa read against the grain
      of the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>. Louisa replied to Walt's
      query in his  letter,
      "How do you all like the nomination of Seymour and Blair?" Despite her
      annoyance with the daily paper's political orientation, she continued to
      subscribe to it out of habit and familiarity (see her  letter to Walt).<br><br>
      "Copperhead" is a derisive term for an antiwar Democrat.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00548_n4">9. Salmon P. Chase
      (1808–1873) was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He sought the 1868
      presidential nomination of the Democratic Party, but his support for African
      American suffrage undermined his candidacy. Horatio Seymour was selected as the
      party's nominee. Also see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's response to a Thomas Nast
      cartoon on Chase's politics in her 
      letter to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r9">[back]
