      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I got yours of the 24th ult. &amp; also the 
      pamphlets of mine I lent you, therein mentioned—for which thanks.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I enclose a copy of the selections you made from my journal, and also an account of
      the information Miss Harris gave me as to what she knew of Mr. Lincoln's
      assassination.<sup><a href="#loc.05585_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Since seeing you I have been all the time intending, but have never yet found leisure
      to hunt thoroughly for those loose sheets which I used sometimes to resort to,
      partly because I was accustomed to write my journal in a hurry—leaving spaces
      to be filled up at the first opportunity thereafter, &amp; then found I had not left
      myself enough room; and partly as a matter of
      precaution, Washington being most of the war-time virtually, &amp; now &amp; then
      literally, a besieged city; and during the war I wrote a good deal that would not
      have been pleasant to some readers, who might have made things uncomfortable for
      me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>What has added to my delay in forwarding, is that having an invitation the week
      before last to a morning reception  at the house of a lady in
      town—an old Washington friend of both of us—I thought it possible I might
      meet the former Miss H. there (though she lives in Albany) &amp; get the whole story
      over again from her own lips. It did not happen so however.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Once written, it was not worth while to amend what I said about the actors, which
      I
      see you really thought it worth while to print. It was written, like everything else
      of mine, outside of my professional work, (&amp; some of that,) hurriedly, &amp; it
      strikes me I have in my portfolios much that is better than that, unprinted.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As might be expected, your "May Afternoons" makes excellent reading. (By the way,
      I
      had my hand somewhat in the making of the Central Park—having been appointed on
      its architectural staff in 1859 &amp; professionally connected with it until the war).
      But why,
      studying the Park equipages, should you count on seeing anything in the way of
      "'style' that fully justified itself"?—and why
      should your "top-loftical" friends, perched up
      on the barouche seats, be otherwise than "ill at ease." Nineteen out of twenty of
      the equipages in the Avenue &amp; Park 
      (those that are not owned by livery stable
      keepers—horses, drivers, military cockades &amp;
      all—though a civilian feels just as happy with one on the coachman's hat)
      belong to men who have made all their money by  less or more—generally
      more—questionable coups d'affaires within a decade—who know the chances
      are they will lose it within a year—and who are brothers or cousins of more or
      less remote degree, of the journeymen who made their carriages &amp; of the coachman
      who sits on the box. Just as fast (with of course many honorable exceptions) as they
      have made their money, the men have lost their true manliness &amp; the women have
      smothered their real graces in millinery &amp; pearl powder. There is neither an
      aristocracy nor a peasantry in this country—nothing but a bourgeoisie,
      connected from top to bottom by blood &amp; marriage. The nearest approach to the Old
      World's "higher classes"—in the sense of the possessors of the culture that
      is likely to come <u>with</u> birth or <u>to</u> genius—consists of men
      of letters, art &amp; other
      professions, &amp; of the descendants of colonial families of importance—and
      few if any of these have money enough to compete with the shifting wealth that comes
      &amp; goes in the hands of commerce &amp; finance. I have had a little to say on
      these matters in a paper recently published, which I read before the N.Y. Municipal
      Society. I will try to spare you a copy if you would like to see it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I dare say your correspondence is heavy enough; but I should like to know, at least
      by a postal card, that you have  received the within. In the summer I run away from office
      interruptions to write—but it makes no difference whether you address as above,
      or to my office in the city, as my letters are forwarded every day. I suppose however
      I will be apt to get anything a few
      hours earlier if addressed to this place, for I am at present not going to the
      office more than twice a week.
   </p>
