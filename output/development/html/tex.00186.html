      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wrote to Han last Saturday. I hope you manage to keep comfortable this cold
      winter—it must be pretty tough up there on that bleak hill—It has been
      very cold here, but I have not minded it—My thick overcoat that Nelson<sup><a href="#tex.00186_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> made comes in first-rate this winter—it is
      quite good yet—I have not bought any new clothes for a long
      while—suppose I must get some next spring.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is a Bill before Congress to give extra pay to the clerks—if it passes I
      shall have something extra, too—but I make no calculations on it, for I think
      it quite uncertain. The debates in Congress now are quite exciting—sometimes
      they hold their sessions quite late in the night, &amp; things get to be quite
      stormy. William Hunter (who is in the House, from Brooklyn, to fill out James
      Humphrey's term)<sup><a href="#tex.00186_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      called a Republican member "a liar"—so the Speaker had Mr. Hunter up before
      him &amp; gave him a formal reprimand—it was last Saturday. Mrs. Mix<sup><a href="#tex.00186_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> went that cold Friday night, twelve days ago—I have
      not heard from her. It was a bad night for a journey, &amp; the track was blocked
      with snow.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I receive letters from the soldiers every now &amp; then. Within a week I have had
      two invitations—one is from a young fellow named Alfred Pratt.<sup><a href="#tex.00186_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I knew him in one of the hospitals two years ago,
      &amp; more. His folks are farming people out in northwestern New York, near the
      shores of Lake Erie—he writes half the letter, &amp; his father &amp; mother
      write the other half, inviting me to come there &amp; pay them a visit—the
      parents say they "will do every thing they can to make a country visit
      agreeable"—the letter is very old fashioned, but very good. Then I had
      another invitation, from a Michigan boy. He has got married, &amp; has a small farm,
      not far from Detroit.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Do you remember Lewis Brown,<sup><a href="#tex.00186_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> the Maryland boy, who had such a time
      with his leg, &amp; had it amputated at last in Armory Square hospital? He is quite
      well otherwise, &amp; has got a place in the Treasury Dep't. I send the
      advertisement of the new book about the Ninth Corps—if George wants it, I
      think he can find it at the American News Co. 121 Nassau st. New York<sup><a href="#tex.00186_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—We have ill luck among the clerks &amp;c in
      our office—I send a little slip from the Washington <em>Star</em><sup><a href="#tex.00186_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—then another
      clerk, Mr. Rowland,<sup><a href="#tex.00186_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> is lying very sick. It is doubtful if he recovers. Wm. O'Connor has just
      been in to see me—He is well &amp; flourishing.

   <p>Mother, no letter from you the past week—</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00186_n1">1. There were two tailors by
      this name in the Brooklyn Directory of 1865–1866: Andrew, 372 Myrtle
      Avenue, and N., 739 Atlantic Avenue.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00186_n2">2. John Ward Hunter
      (1807–1900), not William, was elected to complete the term of James
      Humphrey (1811–1866), who was a Congressman from 1859 to 1861, and, after
      two unsuccessful attempts, was elected for the second time in 1864.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00186_n3">3. Mary Mix lived with her
      daughter, Juliet Grayson, who operated the boardinghouse at 468 M North, where
      Walt Whitman lived between late January 1865 and February 1866. After her
      daughter's death on January 7, 1867 (which Whitman reported to his mother on
      ), Whitman wrote in a  letter to his mother that Mix
      would be leaving Washington to live with her granddaughter, Mrs. Samuel S.
      Haskell, Jr.<a href="#r3">[back]

      Alfred Pratt is contained in this letter and those of , , , , , , , and .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00186_n5">5. Lewis Kirke Brown
      (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
      August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
      transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in
      February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on
      February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come
      and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on
      January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary
      (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was employed in the
      Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's letter of . The following September he
      became a clerk in the Treasury Department and was appointed Chief of the
      Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until his retirement in 1915.
      (This material draws upon a memorandum which was prepared by Brown's family and
      is now held in the Library of Congress.)<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00186_n6">6. The book in question is
      Augustus Woodbury, <em>Burnside and the Ninth Army Corps: A
         Narrative of Operations in North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio,
         Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee</em> (Sidney S. Rider &amp; Bros.,
      Publishers, Providence, R.I.). Walt Whitman pasted on the advertisement of the
      book. He had previously written of Jeff's potential interest in the book in his
       letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00186_n7">7. The clipping from the <em>Star</em> read: "Accidents.—On Tuesday morning, as Mr.
      J. Hubley Ashton, Assistant Attorney General, was leaving his residence, corner
      of 14th and F streets, he fell and cut his face so badly as to confine him to
      his room for a few days. On the following day, Mr. F. U. Stitt, the pardon clerk
      of the same office, received a fall, by which his left arm was badly injured."
      Ashton actively interested himself in Walt Whitman's affairs and obtained a
      position for the poet in his office after the Harlan fracas.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00186_n8">8. John A. Rowland, a clerk
      in the Attorney General's office, substituted for Walt Whitman when he was on
      leave in 1870.<a href="#r8">[back]
