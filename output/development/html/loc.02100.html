      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The second copy of "November Boughs" reached me by post this morning; and a few lines
      are due to you to let you know its safe arrival. It is a great pleasure to me to
      receive it. I did particularly want it with your writing in it, and shall always
      read
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>from this copy and value it highly. I did not say anything of its absence from the
      big parcel<sup><a href="#loc.02100_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>, because I supposed there was some good
      reason, &amp; knew I had much more anyway than I deserved. I shall keep the extra
      phototype portrait when you have placed it in the "Sands."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Miss Louisa Drewry,</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>the lady whose paper I told you of in my last<sup><a href="#loc.02100_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>, called
      here yesterday to see the various editions of your books, and the portraits I have
      of you. She is a thoroughly intelligent appreciator &amp; sees something of the
      magnitude of L. of G. She has carried off Mrs. Gilchrist's<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      papers on you to read (Herbert's<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r4">4</a></sup> book).
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>You will probably hear from her, as she fancies to get some books you distribute
      yourself.
   </p>

      Yours always in affectionate respect

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Henry "Harry" Buxton
      Forman (1842–1917) was a British man-of-letters, an editor of and
      authority on the works of Keats and Shelley, and, starting in 1887, a
      conspirator in literary forgeries that were exposed after his death. The
      correspondence at this time between Bucke and Forman makes it clear that Bucke
      was also building up Forman's collection of Whitman (D. B. Weldon Library,
      University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario).

   <p id="n0259">3. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
