      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:  
      
   </p>
   
   <p>All echoes are delightful, especially such as this one: I was sitting at breakfast
      yesterday morning, when the lines came into my head which someone has written of
      Milton:
   </p>
   
   <p>
      "Chief of organic numbers,  
      <br>Old poet of the spheres—"<sup><a href="#med.00824_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>And I thought how much more applicable they were to you than to Milton. Just then
      the
      postman rang and left me your letter of the 12th!<sup><a href="#med.00824_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> This
      may have been an Irish echo, but all the same an echo.
   </p>
   
   <p>I was very glad to hear from you. I have been longing to send you a word, but you
      can't imagine how hard it is for me to rouse myself to write, in my condition of
      lameness and lethargy. I have lately been undergoing <em>massage</em>,
      and it certainly was doing me good, but about the first of the month my poor
      massager, a sturdy young German, fell ill with typhoid fever, and I am now sliding
      backward.
   </p>  
   
   <p>Today is your day for talking about Mr. Lincoln, but I suppose you will not.</p>
   
   <p>April 16.—I was interrupted here, and could not resume until now. I must
      certainly try to write to Dr. Bucke.<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r3">3</a></sup> His visit here en route to
      Florida was very pleasant. I am glad to hear that Kennedy's<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      book is to come out. I tried to get him some subscribers here, but, alas! my
      wretched lameness prevents me from exerting myself as I want to. Stedman<sup><a href="#n1043" id="r5">5</a></sup> was here during the Authors' week, and told me he had
      subscribed, which was good of him. He spent an evening with us and spoke of you with
      enthusiasm. I read over lately, for the first time, his article on you as it appears
      in the book, and find he has greatly improved it, making many excisions and
      modifications. It gratified me to see that my talk with him after the magazine
      article came out had impressed him. His face is Zionward, and he will be a credit
      to
      the family yet. He gave me a beautiful account of your last reading of the Lincoln
      Memorial—the look at the theater, the magic scene of you on the stage
      inorbed by the light of the lamp on the table, the little girl coming up to you with
      the basket of flowers, &amp;c., &amp;c. It must all have been very charming.
   </p>
   
   <p>I did not even know that you were writing little pieces for the Herald<sup><a href="#n4133" id="r6">6</a></sup> until some
      time after you had begun; then I got the back numbers as far as I could, and cut out
      the pieces, but could not get them all. So I shall be glad to see them in November
      Boughs. I should like to know what arrangement Bennett made with you, whether it
      still continues, &amp;c. I am all in the dark about it. And what is the meaning of
      this onslaught that Tucker<sup><a href="#nyp.00496_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup> makes on you in Liberty—Tucker, who did such
      yeoman's service for us in the fight with Oliver Stevens and Company? I don't
      understand it at all. I hope you have not been writing anything in praise of that
      old dead werewolf, Emperor William. It would be an awful mistake. His was a black
      record. I cannot help thinking that Tucker has made some egregious blunder, but I
      have no light on the matter at all.
   </p>
   
   <p>Donnelly's<sup><a href="#n4108" id="r8">8</a></sup> book is announced for May, the printer's strike in
      Chicago having delayed it. All is blooming for him. He is now in England, and there
      is a good deal of excitement about him. The delay in publication has enabled him to
      translate about fifty pages more of the cipher for his volume, which is a decided
      gain for the true believer. Despite my illness and inanition, I am all agog for the
      result.
   </p>
   
   <p>
      "O for the light of another sun,
      <br>With my Bazra sword in my hand!"<sup><a href="#med.00824_n3" id="r9">9</a></sup> 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Donnelly has made lately a remarkable discovery—that the two folio editions of
      the play following the edition of 1623, at intervals of nine and twelve years
      respectively, long after Bacon's<sup><a href="#n4261" id="r10">10</a></sup> death, are absolute facsimiles
      of the first, even the same number of words on each page being preserved. As
      stereotype did not then exist, these editions were manifestly in each case reset,
      which could only have been done in this way with great painstaking: and it proves
      that somebody in the interest of Bacon was alive and busy in preserving carefully
      the form of the original folio! This is a swashing blow for the Shakespeareans!
   </p>
   
   <p>What an idyl of your room you opened to me in your flash of description—you in
      the big chair, the window open to the sunset, the Easter lilies on the sill, and the
      little bird singing his furious carol! It was quite divine. How I wish you could get
      active and well!
   </p> 
   
   <p>If Nelly<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r11">11</a></sup> knew I were writing she would surely send you her love.
      She has not been very well this spring—colds being rampant with everyone.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good-bye, dear Walt—that is, au revoir. I hope you will keep fairly well at any
      rate, and that I shall see you before long.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Always affectionately,
      <br></br>W. D. O'Connor.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="n3039">4. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n1043">5. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4133">6. In late 1887, James Gordon Bennett,
      Jr., editor of the <em>New York Herald</em>, invited Whitman to
      contribute a series of poems and prose pieces for the paper. From December 1887
      through August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems appeared.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00496_n4">7. Benjamin R. Tucker was a
      translator and friend of Ruskin as well as an editor. On , Tucker offered to act as Whitman's publisher in order
      to test the Boston banning of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1992], 9
      vols., 2:253–254). As editor of <em>Liberty</em>, he
      followed the Boston controversy closely in editorial comments on May 27, June
      10, and July 22. In the July issue he printed an advertisement in which he
      offered to sell and mail <em>Leaves of Grass</em> to any
      purchaser, and informed Stevens, Marston, Tobey, and Comstock, all of whom were
      mentioned by name, that he was willing to have his offer tested in the courts.
      On August 19 he commented: "We have offered to meet the enemy, but the enemy
      declines to be met. . . . We still advertise the book for sale, and sell it
      openly and rapidly." The advertisement appeared again on September 16. For more
      information on the controversy, see Joseph P. Hammond, "Stevens, Oliver (b.
      1825)" and "Comstock, Anthony (1844–1919)," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4108">8. Ignatius Loyola Donnelly
      (1831–1901) was a politician and writer, well known for his notions of
      Atlantis as an antediluvian civilization and for his belief that Shakespeare's
      plays had been written by Francis Bacon, an idea he argued in his book <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in Shakespeare's
         Plays</em>, published in 1888.<a href="#r8">[back]

      translation of Friedrick August von Heyden's "The Last Words of Al-Hassan"
      contains the lines "O Allah, for the light of another sun, / With my Bazra sword

         University Magazine</em> in 1845 and frequently reprinted during the
      nineteenth century.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4261">10. Francis Bacon (1561–1626) was
      an English philosopher, scientist, statesman, and author. Bacon's personal
      notebooks and works came under scrutiny during the nineteenth-century because of
      suspicions that he had written plays under the pen-name William Shakespeare in
      order to protect his political office from material some might find
      objectionable. For more on the Baconian theory, see Henry William Smith, <em>Was Lord Bacon The Author of Shakespeare's Plays?: A Letter to
         Lord Ellesmere</em> (London: William Skeffington, 1856).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">11. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
