   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The editor of the <em>Critic</em> at this time was Jeannette Gilder (1849–1916), who wrote
      that "one of the things of which I am most proud is that the <em>Critic</em> was the first publication of its class to invite Walt Whitman
      to contribute to its pages" (see Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt
         Whitman as Man, Poet, and Friend</em> [1915], 97); she was assisted in her
      editorial tasks by her brother Joseph. For more, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_94.html">Gilder, Jeannette L. (1849–1916)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01414_n1">1. The anonymous lead article
      of <em>The Critic</em> stated that "Walt Whitman has many
      characteristics of Hugo. Like him Whitman began with very simple rhymes in
      ordinary metres and in later life broke through all the rules. About 1850 Hugo
      seems to have learned in the school of adversity the beauty of democratic
      principles which came to Whitman naturally through his birth and education."
      Whitman had always liked being compared to Hugo and even urged William Sloane
      Kennedy to include a comparison to the French writer in his essay on Whitman. On
      the latter, see Whitman's letter to Kennedy of .<a href="#r1">[back]
