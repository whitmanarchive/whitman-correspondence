   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Samuel Clemens
      (1835–1910), better know by his pen name, Mark Twain, had attended
      Whitman's New York lecture in April. He also contributed to Thomas Donaldson's
      fund for the purchase of a horse and buggy for Whitman (see Whitman's  letter [note 4]), as well as to
      the fund to build Whitman a private cottage (see Whitman's  letter to Sylvester Baxter). Twain
      was reported in the Boston <em>Herald</em> of May 24, 1887 to have
      said: "What we want to do is to make the splendid old soul comfortable" (Clara
      Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs: Comrades</em> [1931],
      268).
