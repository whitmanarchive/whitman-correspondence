   <p>Your post card of 22<u>d</u> reached me yesterday afternoon. There
      is nothing new as to my plans since I wrote you last some two or three days ago,
      have not heard from W<u>m</u> Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r2">2</a></sup> since. I
      expect he will be here before the week is out. That he will soon after he gets here,
      proceed to Ottawa to attend to the Canadian and European patents—I do not know
      how long this will take but I hope he will be through there by Xmas time and that
      quite early in the year he &amp; I will go East to "float" the meter in the States.
      It is a weary, almost an endless, business but there is nothing for it but to keep
      pegging away. The weather here has made a decided turn for the better within the last week, today is
      clear, bright, cool and very bracing and delightfull. We are all well and all goes
      quietly and pleasantly with us. I am not too well pleased at this postponement of
      my
      trip East as I am anxious to see you and was counting on it in the immediate future
      but I hope I shall not fail to get East early in January (at latest) and that you
      will then be as well or better than now.— Did your little piece come out in
      the "Critic" yesterday?<sup><a href="#loc.07272_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> if so I hope you will send me a
      copy

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4284">2. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
