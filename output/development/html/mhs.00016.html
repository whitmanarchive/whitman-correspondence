      <br></br><br></br>My dear girls (for this letter is for you both)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will just write you a few lines without formality—</p>
   
   <p>It is evening—has just struck 8—I am sitting up in my room alone—I still feel pretty
      well for me—went over to Phila: &amp; took a long pleasant ride out to the Park in the open car, this afternoon—return'd about an hour ago, &amp; had my supper—Lou is well—she went over to Phila: this forenoon, &amp; this afternoon &amp; evening she has had company, (Aunt Libby, &amp; her
      daughter &amp; daughter's husband—they are down stairs now)—George is well,—he has been
      to New York to-day, &amp; has just return'd, &amp; is down stairs eating his supper—
      
      
      
      Eddy is well &amp; hearty—Tip ditto—We all get along pretty much in the old way—To-day I rec'd an order for five full sets of my books from England, <u>accompanied by the money</u><sup><a href="#mhs.00016_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—(which of course doesn't hurt my feelings a bit)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I havn't been over to the Gilchrists' for about two weeks, as they are all deeply absorbed
      in Mrs. G's illness (from the operation)—but Lou was there a few minutes to-day—didn't see Mrs G, she is doing well, &amp; will probably be up in a couple of weeks,
      or so—Lou saw Beatrice—Herbert is in New York, (up the Hudson) visiting at Mr Burroughs's—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have rec'd a good letter from your father, dated Sept 24<sup><a href="#mhs.00016_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—he was well, &amp; busy in his new office—So, my darlings, you see I have just rattled
      off all the domestic gossip &amp; have now only room to send love from
   </p>

   <p id="mhs.00016_n1">1. The envelope for this letter
      bears the address: Miss Mannahatta Whitman | Care of Mrs Archer | Patapsco
      Seminary | Ellicott City | Maryland. It is postmarked: Camden | Oct | 3 |
      N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="mhs.00016_n3">3. This letter is apparently
      lost. However, on , Jeff had written to
      inform Whitman that he was about to lose his position at the St. Louis Water
      Works because of political pressures, but that he was actively engaged in
      consultation work for Henry Flad &amp; Co., civil engineers.<a href="#r3">[back]
