      <br></br><br></br>My dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your kind letter came to hand yesterday. I was very much supprised to hear that you wer in Brooklin  I was also very sory to hear of your illness &amp; to think that it was brought on by your unselfish kindness
      to the Soldiers  There is a many a soldier now that never thinks of you but with emotions
      of the greatest gratitude &amp; I know that the soldiers that you have bin so kind to
      have a great big warm place in their heart for you. I never think of you but it makes
      my heart glad to think that I have bin permited to know one so good.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you will soon be enjoying good health again for it is one of God's greatest
      blessings  I should like very much to see you back here but I suppose you must stay
      whear it suits your health best but I will still write to you for I can never forget your
      great kindness to me.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have got my leg but I think that I will never be able to walk much on it as my stump
      is so short but if I cant I can go on my crutches for they appear to be a part of
      myself for I have bin on them so long  I have not seen Jo Harris<sup><a href="#nyp.00167_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> or Bartlett<sup><a href="#nyp.00167_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> for over a weak but I believe they are both well  they went to Baltimore on a spree
      on the 4 of July had had what they call a regular gay time, they wer prety hard looking after they got back,
   </p>
   
   <p>Now a word for myself. I have not succeeded in getting a position in any of the Depts
      yet thoug my M.C. tried quite hard Gov Hicks tried also but there is so many aplicants for such positions that there is not much chance but I will still try for I do not
      like to give up after so much trouble.
   </p>
   
   <p>I suppose you herd that J. A. Tabor<sup><a href="#nyp.00167_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> was killed. he was killed in the wilderness the second days battle. I seen some men
      out of his company &amp; they say that he fell dead when he was shot. The Hospitals are
      not so full now as they have bin transferring the men north as fast as they get
      able all the men in the Hospitals that are fit for duty are sent off to their regiments
   </p>
   
   <p>The 4 of July pased of[f] here as usual there was a national salute fired from the surrounding forts
      &amp; there was any amount of sky rockets. they comenced celebrating the 4th on Sunday evening after dark &amp; they kept it up until morning
      I could not sleep a partical all night there being so much noise
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Walt I expect that I will tire you by writing so much but I must write &amp; tell
      you about the rebs while they wer here if you get tired you must rest &amp; begin again
      They first maid their appearence on Sunday night some few miles from the City. On Monday there was great excitement
      in the City, the citizens armed them selves &amp; went out to hold the rebs, in check,
      the soldiers that wer in the Hospitals wer formed into companys, &amp; marched out to the fortifications &amp; put in the Rifle pits, &amp; there was some little
      skirmishing within about 1000 yards of fort Stephens, &amp; some in front of fo[r]t Slocum.
      On Monday night the part of the 6th Army Corps came up and went out &amp; part of the
      19th Army corps came also; on Tuesday morning the excitement was intence the citizents in the Q.M. Dept &amp; some in the War Dept wer armed and hurried out to the front 3 miles from the City limits. On Tuesday morning
      soon as I got my breakfast, George McArthur &amp; I went &amp; took the 1st cars &amp; went out
      as far as they went then we walked out to fort Stephens (&amp; it was a long walk for
      me on my crutches but I was eagre to see the fight if there was to be any) the guard let us through so we went up to
      the advance line of battle &amp; seen the picquets firing the Rebs balls whistling over our heads (there was a motly set there for there was citizens women &amp; Niggers all mixed up in a bunch) at last
      there was one of the rebel bullets struck a man in the head by my side &amp; killed him
      that started some of the Citiznes to the rear with the women but I staid there untill there was another one of our men killed the ball striking him in the abdomen he expired
      in a few minuts at the same time the Colonel of the 98th Pa. (Blair) was brought in off of the skirmish
      line wounded in the head &amp; thy[gh] &amp; arm (I think that he was wounded in all three
      places)  I then left the fort &amp; went back in the woods in the shade. but prety soon the military ordered all non-combatants to the rear. some of the citizens took
      a gun &amp; said that they wer determined to stay &amp; see it out. So then I took my passage in a returnd ammunition train &amp; came back to the Hospt on the same day the balance of the 6th
      &amp; 19th Corps came &amp; the Johnies got up &amp; disstd for the rear  they are now going back
      to rebeldon with their plunder with our arm[y] is following them.
   </p>
   
   <p>After I came back I took sick the hot sun was to much for me &amp; I have bin sick ever
      since but am able to be up—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Lewis Kirke Brown
      (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
      August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
      transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in
      February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on
      February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come
      and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on
      January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary
      (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was employed in the
      Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's . The
      following September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was
      appointed Chief of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until
      his retirement in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was
      prepared by Brown's family and is now held in the Library of Congress.)

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00167_n2">1. Joseph Harris was a
      patient at Armory Square Hospital. He was friends with some of Whitman's other
      Armory Square Hospital comrades, such as Lewis Brown and Adrian Bartlett. See
      Harris's letter to Whitman from .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00167_n3">2. Adrian Bartlett was a
      friend of Joseph Harris and Lewis Brown; all three met Whitman while they were
      being treated at Armory Square Hospital. In this letter, Brown reported that he
      had not seen Bartlett and Harris since they returned from a spree to Baltimore
      on July 4, 1864. According to Brown's letter of , the three young men were living in a Washington
      boardinghouse; Harris was not in good health, and Bartlett worked in the
      Treasury Department.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00167_n4">3. J. A. Tabor seems to
      have been a patient at Armory Square Hospital. Whitman mentions him in his
      letter to Lewis K. Brown from .<a href="#r3">[back]
