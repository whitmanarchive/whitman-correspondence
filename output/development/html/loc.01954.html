      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of the 4th
      instant found me yesterday—somewhat, agreeably, 
      disapointed
      
       in hearing from you so soon again or at all—thinking that perhaps,
      with your duties and your cares you had forgotten the bright memories that I so
      tenderly cherish, or if remembered with out time to attend to it.
   </p>
   
   <p>You remember me in 1865 a green raw lad of Eighteen—without,
      even, an imperfect knowledge of the rudimentary English
      branches, I came home from Washington and applied myself, as soon as possible, to
      school and to study; since then I have acquired a little better knowledge of the
      English—done something in Mathematics,—dipped into Latin and German a
      little.
   </p>
   
   <p>My life since we parted that July day upon the Treasury steps, has been one of hard
      work and little recreation—
   </p>
   
   <p>I find on  looking back to that time, that I am not so pure or
      trusting—that the world isnt  quite so fair and beautiful as it
      seemed then—That the world is not precisely a green pasture for
      unsophisticated human lambs to skip in—That I like dreaming less, and work or
      excitement better—That I have lost a great deal of
      ambition, and gained a like quantity of stupidity—That I dont know nearly so
      much as I once supposed I did.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have written so much of myself simply because you asked me of myself—</p>
   
   <p>My Dear Friend I hope and believe we shall meet sometime in the coming years
      again.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman began his correspondence with
      soldier Byron Sutherland on . In
      April 1870, Sutherland was teaching in Jamestown, N. Y. In reply to Walt
      Whitman's request for further information about his life, the former soldier
      observed on : "You remember me in
      1865 a green vain(?) lad of Eighteen—without, even, an imperfect knowledge of
      the rudimentary English branches, I came home from Washington and applied
      myself, as soon as possible, to school and to study . . . My life since we
      parted that July day upon the Treasury steps, has been one of hard work and
      little recreation—I find on looking back to that time, that I am not so pure or
      trusting—that the world isint quite so fair and beautiful as it seemed then—That
      the world is not precisely a green pasture for unsophistocated human lambs to
