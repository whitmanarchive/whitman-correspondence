   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter of November 30 came safe, &amp; was truly welcome—if you have seen Mrs Howells<sup><a href="#yal.00098_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> she has told you that I intend returning to Washington this winter—I do not know
      how soon, but I shall come, almost certainly—Then Charles Eldridge is to be transferred
      to Boston—I am indeed sorry, on my own account, &amp; yours &amp; Williams, for he will be
      missed by us all, I believe more than he thinks for<sup><a href="#yal.00098_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all well as usual. Mother remains well, &amp; in pretty good spirits, better than
      I would have expected—My brother George still remains a prisoner—as near as we can
      judge he is at Columbia, S C—we have had no word from him<sup><a href="#yal.00098_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>About my book nothing particular to tell—I shall print it myself—also my new edition
      of Leaves of Grass—Most likely shall do it in the way we have talked of, namely by
      subscription—I feel that it is best for me to print my books myself, (notwithstanding
      some very good objections to that course, but the reasons in favor are far stronger)<sup><a href="#yal.00098_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Nelly, you &amp; William have neither of you any idea how I daily &amp; nightly bear
      you in mind &amp; in love too—I did not know myself that you both had taken such deep
      root in my heart—few attachments wear &amp; last through life, but ours <em>must</em>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Good bye, dear Nelly, &amp; good bye, dear William, &amp; God bless you both—</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived with
      William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later John
      Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington years.
      William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
      1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening
         Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor often complained about the
      various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his death. However, his
      government work was relieved by the presence of Whitman, whom he was to love and
      venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
      vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
      pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
      important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
      those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
      O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
      sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
      first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910], 513). For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see Deshae E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>.

      January, Ellen O'Connor feared further changes in the little Washington group of
      Whitman admirers. On , she wrote
      to Whitman: "Every evening we talk of you, &amp; wish you were here, &amp;
      almost every evening we read from Leaves of Grass, read &amp; admire. I don't
      believe, dear Walt, that you have in all the world, two heartier lovers &amp;

      getting out the book yourself. I want it to have a large sale, as I think it
      well might, and I am afraid that this sort of private publication will keep it
      from being known or accessible to any considerable number of
      people."
