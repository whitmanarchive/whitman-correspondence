      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I can't write much tonight, but I want to send you a few lines by this mail.</p>
   
   
   <p>Fred Wild called to see me yesterday &amp; had dinner with me (in Bolton). I spoke of
      my last letter to you, &amp; said that if I had had a spare copy of his photo: I
      would have sent
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>it to you.— So this morning, I was pleased to receive a letter from him
      enclosing one, which I forward herewith.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>He is very much pleased with his copy of L. of G., (he is an old lover of yours,)
      &amp; regards its presentation from Johnston &amp; myself as "another token of our
      brotherhood," covenanted anew in your dear &amp; honoured name. He hopes that the
      influence of the book "may
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>bind our hearts more firmly together in the coming years," &amp; asks me, when I
      write to you again, "to at least send you his warmest love &amp; good
      wishes."— I am glad to do so at once, for I know well how sincere &amp; deep
      his love &amp; admiration for you are.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>He is not "literary" at all, though he is not without appreciation of the <u>best</u> literatures. He has an artist's eye for the beauties
      of
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Nature (paints a little), but prefers Nature at first hand, with its vital freshness
      &amp; movement. (loves <u>the sea</u> especially—boating,
      sailing, fishing &amp;c). He is not conventional, but rather too <u>un</u>conventional, &amp; always prefers to be considered much
      worse than he is, rather than better. He has a wild, native wit of his own, &amp; is
      frank, outspoken &amp; free, in speech &amp; manners—But he is liked at once
      by all wherever he goes. And, at
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>the heart of him is a deep, constant affectionateness, faithful &amp; unswerving,
      &amp; a native reverence of soul, all the deeper because so impatient of make-belief
      as to seem <u>irr</u>everent &amp; irreligious. He has a wife
      &amp; four children of whom he is fond. And I, his friend &amp; intimate chum from
      boyhood, have found him stedfastly loyal &amp; true &amp; affectionate, through
      thick &amp; thin.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish the portrait were a better one, but such</p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>as it is, it may serve as a message of his personal love &amp; adhesion.</p>
   
   
   <p>I rejoice to think that natures like his respond to you so spontaneously &amp; so
      warmly. You can afford to let the literary classes stand in antagonism to you
      (though it can be for a short time only), while the masses (the great majority,) who
      deal with life &amp; nature &amp; experience at first hand, &amp; who despise
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>second hand presentations in books &amp; art, see in you a master, as fresh &amp;
      vital as Nature itself, offering them love &amp; faith, &amp; vistas before
      unknown.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope that you are better, &amp; your "health points" more "favourable" than when
      you wrote last.
   </p>
   
   <p>With love to you always</p>
   
   
   <p>I remain</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
