      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>There is nothing perhaps more than you see in the N Y papers—the fighting down in
      the field on the 6th I think ended in our favor, though with pretty severe losses
      to some of our divisions—the fighting is about 70 miles from here &amp; 50 from Richmond—on
      the 7th &amp; 8th followed up by the rebel army hauling off, they say retreating, &amp; Meade
      pursuing—it is quite mixed yet, but I guess we have the best of it—if we really have,
      Richmond is a goner, for they cannot do any better than they have done—how much the
      9th corps was in the fight, &amp; where, I cannot tell yet, but from the wounded I have
      seen I dont think that corps was deeply in—I have seen 300 wounded, they came in last night, I asked for men of 9th corps, but could not find
      any at all—these 300 men were not badly wounded, mostly in arms, hands, trunk of body,
      &amp;c.—they could all walk, though some had an awful time of it—they had to fight their
      way, with the worst in the middle, out of the region of Fredericksburgh, &amp; so on where
      they could get across the Rappahannock &amp; get where they found transportation to Washington—the
      gov't has decided (or rather Gen Meade has) to occupy Fredericksburgh,<sup><a href="#loc.00825_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> for depot &amp; hospitals—(I think that a first rate decision)—so the wounded men will
      receive quick attention &amp; surgery, instead of being racked through the long journey
      up here—still may come in here—Mother, my impression is that we have no great reason
      for alarm or sadness about George so far—of course I <em>know</em> nothing—Well good by, dearest mother,
   </p>

   <p>Mother, I wrote you yesterday too—tell dear brother Jeff to write me—love to Mat—the
      poor diarrhea man<sup><a href="#loc.00825_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> died, &amp; it was a boon—Oscar Cunningham, 82d Ohio, has had a relapse, I fear it is
      going bad with him—lung diseases are quite plenty—night before last I staid in hospital
      all night tending a poor fellow—it has been awful hot here—milder to-day—
