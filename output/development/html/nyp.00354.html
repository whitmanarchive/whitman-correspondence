      <br></br><br></br>Dear John &amp; 'Sula Burroughs,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The interval of some weeks, (or is it months?) since I last wrote you<sup><a href="#nyp.00354_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> has passed on, bringing no decided change 
      in my condition—in my bad spells, (&amp; I have them often enough) I 'most think the end
      is not far off—but I get over them &amp; my natural buoyancy reässerts itself—(&amp; in the
      main keeps control of the helm)—though to a man of my <em>lazy-activity</em> this whole condition &amp; sickness of mine is very wearing—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To-day I am feeling very comfortable, sitting here in the front room by the open window
      writing this—eat this morning quite a respectable breakfast, beefsteak, bread, &amp; tea—&amp;
      at about 3 shall make a light, 
      moderate bite of dinner—no supper—I find I get along best with <em>one pretty fair-meal only</em>, 
      &amp; that I make breakfast—The gastric &amp; dyspeptic trouble has been serious, &amp; is perhaps
      so yet—pains in left side, distress in head, &amp;c—the old story—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>John Swinton came down from N.Y. &amp; spent Sunday with me—told me lots of N.Y. newspaper
      news, 
      &amp;c.—it was a very welcome visit to me.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was discharged from my clerkship on the last of June, by B. Wilson, the new Solicitor
      of the Treasury—(it is all right)—All questions of <em>what I shall do</em> are to me so subordinate to the question of whether
      I shall soon or ever get well, (or partially well,) that I hardly entertain them seriously—I
      enclose you Tennyson's latest letter to me<sup><a href="#nyp.00354_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—also a slip Swinton gave me—Send them both back in your next letter—Eldridge is in
      Boston on his vacation—I expect a visit from him in about 12 days, on his way back—Best
      love to you both, &amp; I shall be with you yet, I have no doubt.
      
   </p>
