   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Burton Pond (1838–1903)
      was a famous lecture-manager and printer. He was also awarded the Medal of Honor
      for his services in the Civil War. In his 1900 autobiography <em>Eccentricities of Genius</em> (G. W. Dillingham Co: New York), he writes
      about Whitman: "Walt Whitman gave a few readings under my management during his
      life. They were mostly testimonials from friends, and benefits given in the
      theatres of New York City"; he concludes with an anecdote about the poet's
      meeting with Sir Edwin Arnold (p. 497–501).

   <p id="yal.00238_n3">2. Whitman is referring to his
      lecture entitled "The Death of Abraham Lincoln," which he delivered in New York
      City on Thursday, April 14, 1887. He first delivered this lecture in New York in
      1879 and would deliver it at least eight other times over the succeeding years,
      delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He had published a version of
      the lecture as "Death of Abraham Lincoln" in <em>Specimen
         Days</em> (1882–83). For more on the lecture, see Larry D. Griffin,
      "'Death of Abraham Lincoln,'" <em>Walt Whitman: An
