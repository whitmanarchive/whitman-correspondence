   <p>Yours of friday and saturday, (finished the evening of saturday) came to hand last
      evening—and your postcard of sunday reached me this morning. I am greatly
      rejoiced that you are doing so well—I look forward confidently now to seeing
      you in fair trim when I go East next month. You ought to have some copies of the big
      book<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r2">2</a></sup> by now and I shall hope to get one in a very few days. All is quiet here, no
      winter yet, roads slush, grass almost green, thin snow lying in patches, "a gray
      discouraged sky over-head."<sup><a href="#loc.07280_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> Wm Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r4">4</a></sup> not back
      here yet &amp; no further word from him—he may be here this evening.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am reading Parkman's histories—they are most fascinating books—have
      read "La Salle and Discovery of the Mississippi" and am reading "France and Spain
      in
      the New World."<sup><a href="#loc.07280_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> Have struck nothing more interesting for
      a long time—I am borrowing them from R.S. Gurd<sup><a href="#loc.07280_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> who
      has become quite a book man these late years. Hope to be able to tell you tomorrow
      something about Wm Gurd and the meter.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: London | PM | Dec 11 | 88 | Canada; Camden N.J. | Dec | 13 | 12 M |

   <p id="n4151">2. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.07280_n4">3. Bucke is quoting from
      Whitman's "To Think of Time": "A gray discouraged sky overhead, the short last
      daylight of December. . . ."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n4284">4. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
