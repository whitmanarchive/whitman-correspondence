   <p> It was a great shock to J. N. Johnson to have several men tell me when I last went
      to town that they were more or less sure they had seen in some newspaper notices of
      the death of Walt Whitman. I did not think, tho', I should have failed to see it in those I had been reading. It is (as it
      has been) <u>the immeasurable thoughtfulness</u> of us two men
      that should make it the saddest of happenings if we two are never to meet.
      Obstacles, obstacles tho', are always getting in the way. It seems to me if I could see you shortly
      by going to your brother's at St Louis, Mo., I would like to go there. I could serve
      an important business end by a little travel I think—in some direction.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.
