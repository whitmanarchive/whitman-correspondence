   <p>You ask how long it takes a letter to come from you here—well your last
      letter<sup><a href="#med.00853_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> (now before me) is postmarked 5 P.M. 15<u>th</u> (Sunday) and reaches me at 10 this A.M. [—] If
      your letter had been posted at 8.15 (the time you mention) I am not sure whether I
      should get it by the same mail here or whether prehaps it would come by afternoon
      mail and rea/c/h me 4. P.M. In a general way you may reckon from a day and a half
      to
      two days for a letter to pass from Camden or Philadelphia here. [—] Judging by
      your letter and by all accounts I think you are certainly on the mend Walt, and I
      hope we shall have you middling bright and lively again after a little.<sup><a href="#med.00853_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> That would be a grand thing if we could only see it.

   <p>About half of my folk [illegible]  are gone and going to Sarnia on a
      visit—Clare<sup><a href="#loc.07284_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; Ina<sup><a href="#med.00853_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> went
      yesterday, Mrs B.<sup><a href="#n4273" id="r6">6</a></sup> Willie,<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r7">7</a></sup> &amp; Pardee<sup><a href="#n4274" id="r8">8</a></sup> go tomorrow morning. I shall have a quiet house for awhile. The
      weather here keeps perfect, quiet, [illegible] hazy, sleepy
      days—You might fancy it the land of the Lotus Eaters but the devil of it is it
      is <u>not</u>—wish it was—too much work here
      altogether—however perhaps too much is better than not enough and as long as
      one is able to do it it is not [illegible]  right to complain

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
