   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00665_n1">1. This letter dates to
      December 25, 1885. Hannah refers to "all the principal streets in Burlington
      being graded &amp; flagged Pearl (our street) recently." According to the <em>Twenty-First Annual Report of the City of Burlington, Vermont
         (1885)</em>, "The heaviest expense of the year has been caused by the
      extensive repairs on Pearl, Union and St. Paul streets. Pearl street has been
      brought to grade from the Ravine to Prospect street, and has been curbed and
      guttered from Church street to Prospect street, excepting one side of the street
      between Union and Willard street. With the exception of two blocks the flagging
      is five feet wide" (Burlington: R.S. Styles, 1886), 61.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00665_n2">2. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman
      (1842–1892), known as Lou, married George Whitman on April 14, 1871. They
      moved to Camden in 1872. Walt Whitman lived with them from 1873–1884. See
      Karen Wolfe, "Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892)" <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00665_n3">3. Whitman visited Burlington
      in June 1872, as an extension of a trip he took to Dartmouth College in New
      Hampshire to deliver the commencement poem. Whitman wrote "As a Strong Bird on
      Pinions Free" for the occasion. See Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The
         Solitary Singer</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985),
      442.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00665_n4">4. Hannah's abbreviation for
      Charles.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00665_n5">5. Heyde followed the example
      set by the Art Unions in the mid-nineteenth century, of holding a lottery to
      sell his paintings. The Art Union would charge subscribers to belong to its
      organization each year, and at the end of the year a drawing would be held.
      Winners would receive original works of art that the Art Union had purchased.
      More than likely Heyde charged a nominal fee for his lotteries. See William H.
      Gerdts, Jr. <em>Painting and Sculpture in New Jersey</em> (New
      Jersey: D. Van Nostrand, 1964), 84.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00665_n6">6. The New York <em>Herald</em>, a daily newspaper, was established by James
      Gordon Bennett on May 16, 1835. The <em>Herald</em> (published
      from 1835 to 1924), was a "popular, cheap, mass circulation newspaper....the
      most successful and widely circulated newspaper in mid-nineteenth-century
      America." See James Crouthamel, <em>Bennetts New York Herald and
         the Rise of the Popular Press</em> (Syracuse: Syracuse UP, 1989), ix.<a href="#r6">[back]
