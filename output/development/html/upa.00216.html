      <br></br><br></br>Dearest friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Bumble-bees &amp; Bird Music" safe to hand this morning—does me good—makes me feel exactly
      as if I were with you in the flesh enjoying it       all—dear America! I never saw
      here—thousands—swarms of bumblebees—on the contrary they seem always in ones &amp; two—&amp;
      half a dozen at a time would be quite surprising. Your robin is not the sam as ours either &amp; is really they tell me a kind of 
      
      
      
      thrush. Ours is the plumpest little roly poly of a bird—fat saucy, fierce &amp; bold—his
      breast a much brighter red too. I am wondering whether this was written from Glenfield—whether
      you have found a "creek" there, or are back at "Timber Creek". I had a pain too in
      reading it—suddenly remembered your birthday—that it was past &amp; I had not written
      one word—not just put my hand in yours as I would fain always do on that day. I am
      so very sorry. I was then (when I should have written—middle of May 
      
      
      
      just preparing &amp; starting on my journey to the north—first to Redear on the Yorkshire
      coast to stay with Percy &amp; his wife &amp; the dear little son in a cottage within a yard
      or two of the beach—the North Sea rolling up on broad smooth sands there, but with
      treacherous reefs just beyond on which there were [illegible] wrecks last winter. I enjoyed everything—the being with Norah (who is like one of
      my own) &amp; the dearest jolliest little man digging &amp; playing happily in the sands—&amp;
      the wonderful colours &amp; sweet odors of the sea—everything is [
      <span class="unclear">best?</span>]
       
      
      
      
      except the keenness of the wind which made my breathing worse—&amp; the absence of dear
      Per himself who was all the time busy over his fierce furnaces &amp;c in Sheffield. And
      now I am with Beatrice &amp; needn't tell you what a pleasure that is. She looks rather
      pale, but seems otherwise strong &amp; hearty, &amp; to have her heart in her work as much
      as ever—gaining more confidence in herself, too, which was what she most needed. Much
      liked by her patients—you know what a grand old place Edinburgh is amid its rugged
      hills &amp; the beautiful broad firth 
      
      
      
      of which one gets fine glimpses at the end of many of the streets. And then the wonderful
      grey old houses almost as high &amp; massive as the hills (but I fear, too, full of most
      ancient dirt, &amp; crammed with a poor, dirty, ragged looking population)—And the castle
      on its wooded height in the very midst—&amp; the great cavern below that runs through
      the city &amp; has many bridges over it. Drink is the giant evil of the city as of the
      north generally—Such a sensible rugged healthy looking people too! how can they give
      themselves up to the mean &amp; ugly demon. It must be that the scanty amount of sunshine
      gives a great craving for
      
      
      
      the bottled fire. They seem even fonder even than we English of their dogs—take them
      into Church in country places &amp; here into the cars where there are generally two or
      three faithful shaggy fellows uneasily wriggling in &amp; out to avoid getting their poor
      little toes trodden on.—How about England dearest friend? Do your thoughts turn that
      way? I have an old friend coming for a week or two at the beginning of August—after
      that a sunny bed-room ready &amp; waiting for you—as long as ever you will stay with us.
      Love to your brother &amp; sister &amp; to Mrs. Marvin &amp; John Burroughs &amp; to Hattie &amp; Jessie
      &amp; most of all to yourself. If Per were here he would return your friendly message.
      Bees best love. I send a line of Herbs that you may see how well they are getting
      on without me.
