   <p>The <em>Homer</em>
      <sup><a href="#med.00312_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> has come &amp; is now lying before me. I thank you deeply. I am very well, this summer,
      &amp; go to the Hospitals daily &amp; nightly—as I find a greater proportion of sad cases
      than ever—&amp; for some reason or other there are few or no visitors. I enjoy my visits
      with a sad but profound joy &amp; satisfaction—especially at night, when the light is
      nearly turned off, &amp; I am soothing some suffering one.
   </p>
   
   <p>I send you, same mail with this, two copies of the little book Drum-Taps. Farewell.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Swinton (1829–1901), a journalist and
      friend of Karl Marx, became acquainted with Whitman during the Civil War.
      Swinton, managing editor of the <em>New York Times</em>,
      frequented Pfaff's, where he probably met Whitman. Whitman's correspondence with
      Swinton began on . Swinton's
      enthusiasm for Whitman was unbounded. On , Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly impressed with the great
      humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you. I read this afternoon in
      the book. I read its first division which I never before read. I could convey no
      idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more to me than all other books and
      poetry." On , Swinton wrote what
      the poet termed "almost like a love letter": "It was perhaps the very day of the
      publication of the first edition of the 'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of
      it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street, Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it
      with wonder, and felt that here was something that touched on depths of my
      humanity. Since then you have grown before me, grown around me, and grown into
      me" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.13.html">Tuesday, April 10, 1888</a>). He praised Whitman in the <em>New York Herald</em> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke,
      <em>Walt Whitman</em> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
      36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
      for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <em>New York Sun</em>, and for the next four years edited the
      weekly labor journal, <em>John Swinton's Paper</em>. When this
      publication folded, he returned to the <em>Sun</em>. See Robert
      Waters, <em>Career and Conversations of John Swinton</em>
      (Chicago: C.H. Kerr, 1902), and Meyer Berger, <em>The History of
         The New York Times, 1851–1951</em> (New York: Simon and Schuster,
      1951), 250–251. See also Donald Yannella, "Swinton, John
      (1829–1901)," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed.
      J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing,
      1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00312_n100">1. A facsimile of this letter
      is printed in George M. Williamson, <em> Catalogue of A Collector
         of Books, Letters, and Manuscripts Written by Walt Whitman</em>
      (1903).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00312_n2">2. Probably this is
      Whitman's copy of <em>The Odyssey of Homer</em>, translated by
      Theodore Alois Buckley (1863), now in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection at the
      Library of Congress. On the flyleaf Whitman wrote: "Possess'd by me from 1868 to
      1888 and read by me during those times—Sometimes in Washington &amp; sometimes
      in Camden—Small or larger readings—Often in Camp or Army Hospitals—Walt
      Whitman." Obviously either the reference to the hospitals or the date "1868" is
      in error.

   <p id="med.00312_n3">3. James Harlan
      (1820–1899), secretary of the interior from 1865 to 1866, dismissed
      Whitman from his second-class clerkship on . Harlan apparently took offense at the copy of the 1860 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> which Whitman was revising and which he
      kept at his desk. With the help of William Douglas O'Connor and Assistant
      Attorney General J. Hubley Aston, Whitman secured a position in the attorney
      general's office. The Harlan episode led directly to O'Connor's pamphlet "The
      Good Gray Poet." Although Harlan was a Methodist, he was not a parson. Whitman
      may have sarcastically applied this term to Harlan because on May 30, 1865,
      Harlan had issued an official directive asking for the names of employees who
      disregarded "in their conduct, habits, and associations the rules of decorum
      &amp; propriety prescribed by a Christian Civilization" (Jerome Loving, <em>Walt Whitman's Champion</em> [College Station: Texas A&amp;M
      University Press, 1978], 57).<a href="#r3">[back]
