   <p>I merely want to say that I have read your letter in the London <em>Daily News</em><sup><a href="#loc.02828_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—all your three letters—&amp; that I deeply appreciate them, 
      &amp; do not hesitate to accept &amp; respond to them in the same spirit in which they were
      surely impelled &amp; written.
      
   </p>

      May God bless you &amp; yours,
      <br></br>Walt Whitman.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02828_n1">1. This draft letter is
      endorsed, "to Buchanan | April 4 '76 | Sent B the N Y | letter of July 4 '78 |
      (to Olean Scotland)." The last three lines of the endorsement were added three
      years later. Whitman referred to "A Poet's Recreation," published in the <em>New York Tribune</em> on July 4, 1878; see Whitman's  letter to Whitelaw Reid.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.02828_n2">2. Buchanan's article of
      March 13, 1876; Whitman had referred to it in a  letter to William Michael Rossetti.<a href="#r2">[back]
