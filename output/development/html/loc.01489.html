      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>It was very kind of you to send me the photographs of yourself, which I value much.
      I
      had previously received one, carte de visite size, from Mr. Rossetti,<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r1">1</a></sup> in which you wear your hat. These I like better, though I liked
      <u>that</u>.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will name some of your friends on this side of the water whom I know myself. I wish
      I could make it appear how various these natures are which have come into relation
      with you. There is my brother (a clergyman) who finds his truth halved between John
      H. Newman<sup><a href="#n0441" id="r2">2</a></sup> (of Oxford celebrity) &amp; you. There is Todhunter,
      (a doctor  a man of
      science, &amp; a mystic,—a Quaker),<sup><a href="#loc.01489_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> he has had a wish to
      write on the subject of your poems, &amp; may perhaps accomplish it. There is
      O'Grady (a barrister, an ardent nature, much interested in social &amp; political
      principles),<sup><a href="#n0453" id="r4">4</a></sup> he overflows with two authors, Carlyle<sup><a href="#n0139" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; yourself. There is Cross (a clergyman, the most sterling
      piece of manhood I know) he has I daresay taken you in more thoroughly than any of
      us, in proportion to his own soundness &amp; integrity of nature. There is
      Tyrell<sup><a href="#n0655" id="r6">6</a></sup> whom I named before (a fellow of Trinity College, an
      excellent Greek scholar). There is a woman of most fine character &amp; powerful
      intellect, Miss West, (daughter of the Dean of St. Patrick's, Dublin).<sup><a href="#n0690" id="r7">7</a></sup> She, I hope, will at some time write &amp; publish the
      impression your writings have made upon her, as she is at present about to do in the
      case of Robert Browning.<sup><a href="#n0116" id="r8">8</a></sup> Then I know  three painters in London, all men of
      decided genius, who care very much for all you do—Yeats,<sup><a href="#n0734" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      Ellis<sup><a href="#n0211" id="r10">10</a></sup> (who has, I believe, in M.S. some study of your
      poems, which at some time may come to be printed)—&amp; Nettleship<sup><a href="#n0437" id="r11">11</a></sup> whom Rossetti knows, &amp; who has published a book on R.
      Browning. I have been told that Nettleship at one time when "Leaves of Grass" was
      out of print &amp; scarce, parted with his last guinea or two to buy a copy.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>All I have named, (&amp; I myself may be included) are young, &amp; may, I think, be
      fairly taken to represent ideas in literature which are becoming, or which will
      become, dominant.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>One think strikes me about every one who cares for what you write—while your
      attraction is  most
      absolute, &amp; the impression you make as powerful as that of any teacher or <u>vates</u>, you do not rob the mind of its independence, or
      divert it from its true direction,—you make no slaves, however many lovers.
   </p>

      Very truly yours
      <br></br>Edward Dowden

   <p>Should you care to carry out a half intention you had of writing to me direct to
       50, Wellington Road, Dublin.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0522">1. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0441">2. John Henry Newman (1801–1890) was a priest in
      the Church of England and a leader in the Oxford Movement, which argued for the
      return of the Anglican Church to many Catholic beliefs and ritual expressions.
      In 1845, Newman left the Church of England and eventually became a Cardinal in
      the Roman Catholic Church under Pope Leo XIII (1810–1903, r.
      1878–1903). In 1854, Newman was one of the founders of the Catholic
      University of Ireland (now University College Dublin).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.01489_n1">3. Dr. John Todhunter
      (1839–1916) later held a chair in English literature at Alexandria College
      in Dublin and wrote <em>Study of Shelley</em> (1880), in which he
      termed Shelley, Hugo, and Walt Whitman the three poets of democracy.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0453">4. Standish James O'Grady (1846–1928), a lawyer
      and later a celebrated Irish poet, published (under the pseudonym Arthur Clive)
      "Walt Whitman: the Poet of Joy," the <em>Gentleman's
         Magazine</em>, 15 (1875), 704–716, in which he concluded: Walt Whitman "is
      the noblest literary product of modern times, and his influence is invigorating
      and refining beyond expression." See Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt
         Whitman in England</em> (1934), 180–182, and Hugh Art O'Grady, <em>Standish James O'Grady—The Man &amp; the Writer</em> (1929).

   <p id="n0139">5. Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) was a Scottish
      writer who wrote frequently on the conflict between scientific changes and the
      traditional social (often religious) order. For Whitman's writings on Carlyle in
      <em>Specimen Days</em>, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf087v1">Death of Thomas Carlyle</a>" and "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf088v1">Carlyle from American Points of View</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n0655">6. R. Y. Tyrrell (alternately Tyrell)
      (1844–1914), a fellow of Trinity College and "an excellent Greek scholar,"
      delivered a public lecture on Walt Whitman's poetry in 1871; see Horace Traubel,

      Patrick's in Dublin, was one of Edward Dowden's students, and an author and
      translator of German texts herself. She became Dowden's second wife in 1895, and
      after his death published <em>Fragments from Old Letters—E. D. to

   <p id="n0437">11. John Trivett Nettleship (1841–1902), an
      English painter known especially for his portraits of lions, had recently
      published <em>Essays on Robert Browning's Poetry</em> (1868),
      likely the first serious work on the poet. He was a friend of William Michael
      Rossetti and a contributor to the 1876 appeal for funds for Walt Whitman; see
      <em>Rossetti Papers</em>, 339, and Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in England</em> (1934), 37. John Butler Yeats
      reported that Nettleship had spent almost his last three guineas to purchase a
      copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> which "had not been bereaved of
      its indecencies"; see <em>Letters of Edward Dowden and His
