      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yr's just came telling me of y'r moving—As you don't mention my letter of ten
      days since contain'g the little printed slips (in lieu) of preface I suppose it
      &amp; they have not reach'd you<sup><a href="#nyp.00710_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—so I enclose two
      more—Or do they not suit? If so, let them go—I wanted to go on record
      embalming (as much as I could) my tribute of dear W's<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r3">3</a></sup> memory
      &amp; past. Y'r letter to-day is the first I have heard f'm you in two months &amp;
      over—<sup><a href="#nyp.00710_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r5">5</a></sup> is well
      &amp; busy—I hear f'm him often. I continue on ab't the same—slowly
      letting down peg after peg—my mind &amp; my right arm remain'g abt the
      same—I want to finish &amp; print a 2d little annex (the last) to L. of G.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am sitting in my room in Mickle Street in the big old ratan chair with wolf-skin
      spread on back—have a little fire in stove—cool weather—bright sun
      out—was taken out in wheel chair yesterday afternoon—What is
      doing—or what has been done—abt the book of tales &amp;c:?—John
      Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r6">6</a></sup> has just been to see me—He, wife &amp; boy
      still on their Hudson river farm

      Best respects &amp; love

   <p><u>later</u>—<u>afternoon</u>—Yr 2d letter just rec'd &amp; I see you have the Preface
      slip—but perhaps may as well send this yet.<sup><a href="#nyp.00710_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

   <p id="n2002">3. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="nyp.00710_n3">4. Ellen replied on : "Thank you again for the Preface. I am
      pleased with it, for I know you wrote <u>what you felt to
         write</u>. I know that you &amp; I feel more &amp; more a most tender &amp;
      growing love for dear William, &amp; all his noble and generous qualities show
      out to me by contrast, all the time" (Feinberg).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">6. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
