   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
