      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Although I have little to write you about yet I thought I would just "drop you a line"
      as they say telling you that we all are in our usual style of liberty, health and
      pursuit of happiness. The latter of course under great difficulties as everything
      is so awful dear that you can hardly get enough to make a happy dinner on for less
      than 150cts but then we are doing the jolliest we can. How goes things with you. We dont hear from you as often as we used to.<sup><a href="#loc.00410_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I hope you are not so engaged but that you can find time to write home? Do you visit
      the Hospitals as oftens as usual?<sup><a href="#loc.00410_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I suppose so. I hope you are enabled to do as much good as formerly
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have had quite a disappointment in a small way &nbsp;There was a bill introduced in the
      Leg. to give the Brooklyn Sewer Com. the power to build a large sewer in Kent Av.
      raise the grade of the streets around there (Kent Av. from Flushing toward Williamsburg)
      &amp;c quite a large job and we all surely thought it would go through as it is very much
      needed, and Mr Lane had promised me charge of it. Indeed I had commenced making plans,
      profiles &amp;c when at the last moment the thing got squelched, but yet I dont know a[s] I am <em>very</em> sorry for we still expect to get the <em>new main</em>, that is to lay a new line of pipe from the Reservoir down to the city, and even
      if we dont do that why I shall have work enough to keep me along, doing anything and everything
      that turns up<sup><a href="#loc.00410_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Andrew is about the same as when I last wrote you &nbsp;no worse, and I think a little
      better.<sup><a href="#loc.00410_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I do not see much of him as he comes to the house mostly when I am out. He visits
      Dr Ruggles<sup><a href="#loc.00410_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> now and then. The Dr thinks that he will gradually get over it. Mother had a little
      attack of her rheumatism yesterday and to-day and I am somewhat afraid that she will
      have more of it. She has been wonderful foolish in cleaning house as she calls it
      and has overworked herself.<sup><a href="#loc.00410_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> I dont think that she ought to do so, and so I tell her but she always answers that it's
      got to be done and that there is no one but her to do it, &amp;c &nbsp;Mary and Louisa<sup><a href="#loc.00410_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> have gone home &nbsp;They went Thursday last. Mother worked quite hard while they were
      here which may help account for the rheumatism in a measure. Mat is as jolly and good as ever.
      I am glad that she has no work from New York as twould be too much for her. Although she often speaks of writing you, yet she takes it out
      in talking, but she always wants to be remembered to you &nbsp;Hattie is just the same
      little Harem-scarem and joyous little thing that she ever is. If she can only get
      out in the open air 'tis all she wants. It appears to be perfect pleasure to her,
      she dont seem to care about seeing anybody or going to any place, only get out in the air,
      that is all. Twould amuse you to see her when I go home, she seems to be glad enough, and always looks
      at me with an expression "well you've come and you are all right" but otherwise with
      the utmost indifference, and when I tell her to come and see me she says "what do
      I want to see you for" or at other times "What are you going to do with me." You would
      be pleased to see how finely she is growing, seemingly perfect health &nbsp;We have heard
      from George but twice since he left home. I wish we could do so oftener. &nbsp;Have not
      had a letter from Han since I wrote you

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00410_n1">1. In a letter to his
      mother dated , Walt made reference
      to his letter of April 22 (not extant) which had not reached Jeff by April 25.
      However, Walt did promise to "write oftener especially to Jeff."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00410_n2">2. Walt responded: "Jeff
      asks me if I go to hospitals as much as ever. If my letters home don't show it,
      you don't get 'em. I feel sorry sometimes after I have sent them, I have said so
      much about hospitals, &amp; so mournful" (see Walt's letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman dated ).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00410_n3">3. Concerned that Jeff
      might suffer one of his occasional bouts of depression, Walt attempted to place
      his brother's seeming bad fortune in the largest of contexts: "You must not mind
      the failure of the sewer bills, &amp;c. &amp;c. It don't seem to me it makes so
      much difference about worldy successes (beyond just enough to eat &amp; drink,
      and shelter, in the moderatest limits) any more, since the last four months of
      my life especially, &amp; that merely to <em>live</em>, &amp; have
      one fair meal a day, is <em>enough</em>—but then you have a
      family, &amp; that makes a difference" (see Walt's letter to Louisa from ).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00410_n4">4. See Jeff's letter to
      Walt dated .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00410_n5">5. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his
      practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems"
      (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:90, n. 85; 330).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00410_n6">6. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman overworked herself compulsively. Some years before in one of her own
      letters to Walt she remarked, "i had A pery [<em>sic</em>] bad
      cold and coughf when Jeffy wrote and had been cleaning house and worked very
      hard but i am well now" (May 3, 1860? [Trent Collection, William R. Perkins
      Library, Duke University]). See also Jeff's letter to Walt from .<a href="#r6">[back]
