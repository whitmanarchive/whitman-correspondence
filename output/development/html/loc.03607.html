      <br></br><br></br>Dear Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> As announced the other day, I have now the pleasure of enclosing Post-Office orders
      for ￡37.12. 
   </p>
   
   <p> It escaped me to mention in my previous letter that a Mr. Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> not heretofore known to me (59 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea,
      London) called on me 2 or 3 weeks ago, wishing  to obtain your address—wh. I gave him. He intended, as I understood, to write to you with a view to
      entering into some terms regarding a London edition of your Poems. He seemed to me
      to
      have a genuine feeling of regard for yourself &amp; your works, &amp; he asked me to
      convey to you an expression of his feeling when next I 
      shd
      
       write. 
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours always,
      <br></br>W. M. Rossetti.

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
