      <br></br><br></br>Dear Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      Wm
      
       Roſsetti has shown me your letter indicating annoyance at some
      telegram which has reached America, concerning a statement of mine in the Daily
      News. [
      <span class="unclear">Never?</span>]
       was no
      letter of mine in the paper or any paper, but a paragraph which I enclose to you
      written by the editor on the basis of a private letter from me. I wrote to him on
      receipt of a letter from you saying that you wished money to build on your Camden
      lot and paid board to your relatives. My motive was the necessity of saving you
      &amp; your relatives from the degradation implied in Mr. Austin's letter to the same
      paper in which he said "While we talk, he starves"; to defend your American friends
      (such as Burroughs, O Connor, myself &amp; others) from the
      outrageous insults heaped by that fellow Buchanan upon those of
      your countrymen who would share their last loaf with you; and to free you from the
      charge of getting aid on false pretences, of which you were in danger, and myself
      from equal peril of abutting what I knew to be a lie by silence; and you are not the
      man I take you for if you would have had me act otherwise. I can only suppose you
      have seen some bungled &amp; mutilated telegram embodying part of the statement of
      which I now send you the whole.
   </p>
   
   <p>You may remember that I talked to you in my bedroom about your circumstances, after
      I
      had conversed with your sister–in–law, and gathered from  you just what
      you have been kind enough to write to me, except that you did not tell me that you
      wished to build.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In such matters as this the true thing is obviously the politic thing also. It is
      ludicrously false for Buchanan to say that you are in danger of starving, or that
      you have no appreciation in America (where books have been written about you, and
      where you have enthusiastic admirers!) Such absurd and false statements are sure to
      bring down contempt on them who make them, and sometimes imperil the good fame of
      those about whom they are made.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your friends here are quite at one here on the subject, and Rossetti wrote to me that
      he knew Buchanans statements were "exaggerations", before I wrote to the <u>News</u>. The effort to circulate your books by a subscription
      will be succeſsful. Rossetti has had printed for private circulation your
      letter to him which gives substantially the same account of your affairs which is
      contained in the paragraph of the Daily News enclosed.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am much oppressed with work, I cannot write letters. I trust this will find you
      improving in health. Pray remember me kindly to Mr &amp; Mrs Whitman 
   </p>

      I believe me your faithful friend
      <br></br>M D Conway
