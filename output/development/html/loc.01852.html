   <p>Send only a Card to Meltonsville</p> 
   
   
   <p>I feel a desire to write the things which follow—(somewhat discouraged tho' by getting no answer or <u>notice</u> of what I wrote just about two months ago—it didn't <u>need</u> to be answered—perhaps it [
      <span class="unclear">would?</span>]
       [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">answer?</span>]
       it [
      <span class="unclear">satisfactorily?</span>]
       [illegible]ly desired anything [

       [illegible] get it. (An answer by P. Card [illegible] want you to know I am not [
      <span class="unclear">"pouting")?</span>]
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In the fields most things prosper [
      <span class="unclear">still?</span>]
      . The same tenant, a father and grown up son who have made our corn and wheat for
      several years, are now "laying by" or giving their crop its final working—the wheat
      is waiting for the coming of the "travelling" thresher, and is much injured by rust.
      We are having all summer frequent but very light rains. Cotton is healthy but very
      small—I think because of so little hot sunshine. In the spring, when [
      <span class="unclear">commencing?</span>]
       to plow, I was [
      <span class="unclear">feeling?</span>]
       [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">my?</span>]
       13 year old boy [illegible] to g[illegible] [

       so as to be [
      <span class="unclear">able to do?</span>]
       [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">could?</span>]
      , and you "better [illegible] have been enjoying myself at the [
      <span class="unclear">plowing and hoeing ?</span>]
       and always learning some good new "trick" about getting along well with the work.
   </p>
   
   <p>But I object to <u>your</u> plan of going out <u>nimbly at the peep of day</u>—no—<u>sleep</u> till near sun—rise, then build a fire for mother, bring water from the spring—milk
      the cow—eat slowly, long, and heartily, get out about an hour or hour and a half after
      sunrise—take a "siesta" of an hour and a half after [

   <p><u>Let the children sleep long</u> in the summer mornings, for they wont sleep at noon. This is the way to conserve health, strength, long life, happiness,
      sanity of mind.
   </p>
   
   <p>Sleep, sleep, sleep, viva sleep. [
      <span class="unclear">And now I must notice?</span>]
       how little Walt is [illegible]ing. We are [
      <span class="unclear">alone.?</span>]
       [illegible] [
      <span class="unclear">girls?</span>]
       at school—two [

      —mother a mile from [
      <span class="unclear">home to wash?</span>]
       with "soft" water—Papa writing and Walt bellowing—a few minutes ago I put him up
      stairs to sleep free from flies, and tied his leg with a rope to keep him from tumbling
      down the stair way, but he got the rope off, and came to the top and stopped there.
      He has been "cross" for some days, but appears to be well always—curiously, tho 19 1/2 months old and very "smart" he yet doesn't <u>habitually</u> speak a single word—I have told him <u>Walt, you  [
         <span class="unclear">contain?</span>]
          enough, why dont you let it</u> [illegible] [

       have omitted to "celebrate" one very important part of human nature.
   </p>
   
   <p>Haven't you dwelt too much on the longing for and hope of "Immortality" and the <u>flattering</u> conviction of all good deeds <u>"inuring"</u> to or "coming back" to the doers; and skipped the heroic principle (compound probably
      of love and courage) which says "I will do good whether it [
      <span class="unclear">inures?</span>]
       or [illegible] or not, I will be good and [

   <p>A while back some <u>debtors</u> were [
      <span class="unclear">good?</span>]
       enough to pay me a little money!!! I dont <u>doubt that</u>.
   </p> 
   
   <p>When I was a prisoner at Camp Douglas, I read a tale about a young negro man, who
      being for sale at an auction, a "bidder" said to him, "if I buy you, will [illegible]?" The negro gave him a very [
      <span class="unclear">expressive?</span>]
       look, and said "<u>I will be honest [
         <span class="unclear">whether?</span>]
          [illegible] or not</u>" T[illegible] occurred, and [illegible] "honesty" differ, but such a [illegible] good one. "I will be good whether [
      <span class="unclear">I am?</span>]
       "immortal" or not"—" I will be heroic whether anything "<u>inures</u>" or not, even against unpopularity, misunderstanding, hatred, danger, God &amp;c &amp;c".
      (<u>I</u> dont have known <u>enemies</u>.) Walt! I feel confidant you are heroic, and I want to hug your neck. (Have you <u>lost money</u> by your <u>last Edition</u>?) Have you sold well? As for me, I am <u>not</u> aggressive, <u>not</u> "a good [

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.
