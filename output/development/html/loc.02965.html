   <p>Merry 
      Xmas

   </p>
   
   
   <p>You are prolific in surprises these days! The Complete Whitman<sup><a href="#n4168" id="r1">1</a></sup> is a great
      surprise. It dwarfs everything else. That wonderful title page I look at &amp; look at,
      &amp; can't seem to get dovetailed into my mind. —it is so original—unique,
      &amp; full of speaking life.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had a good time yesterday (an exciting warm dash here &amp; there) in Boston while
      getting the books to their respective destinations. Please don't mention the express
      
      ch'g
      
      . it was only—trifle &amp; I want you to let me pay it please. You will have
      heavy postage on so many others of yr 150. Have the other 450 McKay's<sup><a href="#n4983" id="r2">2</a></sup> imprint? I left Baxter's<sup><a href="#n6000" id="r3">3</a></sup> on his office
      table, &amp; he got it shortly, although I did not succeed in seeing him. Garland's<sup><a href="#loc.02128_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> I left with Baxter, having previously verified him
      (Garland) to be on the lookout. (He had a 
      col.
      
       &amp; ½ piece in <u>Herald</u> on single tax (Hen. Georgeism<sup><a href="#loc.02965_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup>)
      yesterday. Sanborn,<sup><a href="#n0915" id="r6">6</a></sup> since his loss of the state inspectorship of Charities
      office, has a table &amp; chair at 141 Franklin St. (Geo.
      
       H. Ellis's printing &amp; pub. house)<sup><a href="#loc.02965_n2" id="r7">7</a></sup>. I left his book on his table in charge
      of good hands. I afterwards took a long walk down to 191 Commonwealth Ave, but found
      that
      
      
      
      Mrs Fairchild<sup><a href="#har.00049_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      
      cd
      
       see no one, owing to one of her children having the measles—a
      catching disease or ailment. I was disappointed as I wanted to chat with her 
      abt
      
       her visit to England.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mrs K's pleasant proof-room is at 
      Geo.
      
       H. Ellis's; &amp; as I happened down there to see Sanborn at 12 
      o'c.
      
       we, (wifey &amp; I), went out together &amp; got a good dinner on Atlantic Ave.
      where we 
      cd
      
       glimpse the sparkling sea, &amp; see the foreign masts right at hand across
      the street.
   </p>
   
   <p>My day had a sad ending. A man right by me in a crowd at Fitchburg R.R. station tried
      to jump aboard train—partially intoxicated I 
      tho't
      
      —fell under the wheels, had his foot cut off, &amp; otherwise, probably
      fatally injured. It was the first bad accident I had ever witnessed (strange to
      say), &amp; it made me sick, haunted me all the evening &amp; night. I 
      tho't
      
       of you &amp; your hospital work, &amp; <u>realized</u> for the
      first time the awful strain it must have been on you nurses &amp; visitors. Such is the
      web of our life—joy &amp; sorrow in rhythmic alternation.
   </p>
   
   <p>Please give my very special congratulations to <u>Traubel</u><sup><a href="#n4267" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      anent this big
      volume (for I suppose he helped some). And give my regards to your Canadian
      nurse-friend. Wife sends love &amp; remembrances.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4168">1. Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888)included a profile photo of the poet
      on the title page. The nearly 900-page book was published in December 1888. For
      more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4983">2. David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6000">3. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="loc.02128_n1">4. Hamlin Garland
      (1860–1940) was an American novelist and autobiographer, known especially
      for his works about the hardships of farm life in the American Midwest. For his
      relationship to Whitman, see Thomas K. Dean, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_190.html">Garland, Hamlin</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02965_n1">5. Henry George
      (1839–1897) was a social reformer from Philadelphia. His published works
      include his pamphlet <em>Our Land and Land Policy</em> (1871), <em>Progress and Poverty</em> (1879), and <em>Social
         Problems </em> (1883).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0915">6. Franklin B. Sanborn
      (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
      he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
      the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
      reviewed <em>Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Boston
         Commonwealth</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00059.html">February 24, 1866</a>. He was editor of the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
      his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
      appeared without Sanborn's name in the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K. Walker,
      "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_206.html">Sanborn, Franklin Benjamin (Frank) (1831–1917)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02965_n2">7. George H. Ellis ran a
      printing office in Boston and became the publisher of the Boston <em>Daily Advertizer</em>, then founded the Boston <em>Evening Record</em> as an organ of support for Democratic
      presidential candidate Grover Cleveland.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="har.00049_n3">8. Elizabeth Fairchild was
      the wife of Colonel Charles Fairchild, the president of a paper company, to whom
      Whitman sent the Centennial Edition on March 2, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). He mailed her husband a
      copy of <em>Progress</em> in April, 1881, shortly after his visit
      to Boston, where he probably met the Fairchilds for the first time (Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">9. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
