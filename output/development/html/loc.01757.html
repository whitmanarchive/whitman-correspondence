      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My condition remains about the same—I don't get ahead any to notice—but I hold my
      own, as favorable as I have stated in my late letters,
      &amp; am free yet from the very confused spells of the head &amp; spasms of three weeks ago.
      
      Besides I think upon the whole, my general strength is the best it has been yet—for
      an interval every now &amp; then it certainly is. All very encouraging—(But my disease
      seems to have such ups &amp; downs I have learned to fear to make 
      calculations, almost.) The weather here is fine—cool mornings &amp; nights, 
      indeed quite cold at times—but the bulk of the day perfect—I think the cool weather
      season is beneficial to me. I am sitting here 
      writing this with one of the windows wide open, &amp; the afternoon sun streaming in.
      
      I got a letter this morning from Mr. Eldridge that he 
      
      
      
      had paid Godey, 
      my substitute, the money I sent on for his October pay.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Washington must be looking pleasant this fall. Write me how you are fixed, 
      and I like to hear all the particulars about your work, on the RR.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">Good bye for this time, my loving boy.<br></br>Walt.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>It is now a little after 2—I have had my dinner, beefsteak &amp; potatos—pumpkin pie &amp; a cup of tea—Don't you think that is doing very well?—It is a glorious
      afternoon &amp; I am going down to take a trip once or twice 
      across the Delaware in the ferry boat. It makes a pleasant little trip as 
      the river here is most as wide as the Potomac from 7th st. wharf—has two little islands in the middle, which sometimes we steer between,
      
      &amp; sometimes go round—Then <u>these nights</u> 
      Pete—last night I was out, came home about 8—the moon shining 
      bright as silver—I thought of our old walks, dear son.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
