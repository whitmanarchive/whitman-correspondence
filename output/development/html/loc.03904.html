   </p>
   
   
   <p>I still keep around &amp; have been over to Philadelphia this afternoon for three
      hours, the day has been so fine &amp; bright, (but I am weak &amp; half-sick
      yet)—over in 
      Phila: I ride in the new Market st. coaches, the [
      <span class="unclear">Herdies?</span>]
       (they start from the
      ferry door, &amp; I buy 25 tickets for a dollar)—I was on Arch and Chestnut
      streets—such crowds—oceans of women, 
      drest
      
       to kill—I like to walk along &amp; look in the windows, every kind
      of article you
      can think of, &amp; many you never thought of—always something new &amp;
      interesting—then I have a friend 
      cor: 7th &amp; Chestnut, Col: Forney's office, a nice big old fashioned
      room—he keeps a great 
      ratan
      
       easy chair for me, by a bay-window, &amp; I always stop there to rest,
      &amp; read the news—How are you all getting along?—We are at the beginning of
      another spring, &amp; I want to come down soon—The chicken was first
      rate—it made me several good meals—(I expected to pay for it, &amp;
      expect to yet)—the strawberries good—they tasted like Glendale—as
      I close it is 9 oclock &amp; a lot of darkies are going along singing an old
      southern slave hymn
