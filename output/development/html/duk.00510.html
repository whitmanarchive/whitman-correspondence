   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00510_n17">1.  This letter dates to
      December 11, 1867. Richard Maurice Bucke, on an accompanying slip of paper held
      in the Trent Collection (not reproduced here), dated this letter December 18,
      1867. In his calendar of letters, Edwin Haviland Miller assigned a
      letter—presumably this one—from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Walt
      Whitman a date range of December 1–15, 1867 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:379). By contrast, Randall H. Waldron cited Bucke's December
      18, 1867 date (<em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 44). Bucke and
      Waldron's date of December 18, which fell on Wednesday—the day of the week
      in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand—would place this letter following her
       letter to Walt. But the
      present letter must precede that one. The letter notes Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman's arrival "here this morning," and in her December 15 letter Louisa
      reported that Jeff "has got well again he eats so heartily." The December 15
      letter in which Jeff is already in Brooklyn is firmly dated in Louisa's hand, so
      this Wednesday letter—which notes Jeff's arrival—must precede that
      one.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">3. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00510_n14">4. Walt Whitman's December
      13?, 1867 letter (which Edwin Haviland Miller dated December 6?, 1867 in Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 1:370; 1:379) to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is
      not extant.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00510_n3">5. The present may have been
      William D. O'Connor's <em>The Ghost</em> (New York: G.P. Putnam,
      1867), or he may have forwarded books or newspapers. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
      and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">6. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00510_n8">7. The "eagle" refers to the
      <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>. Though Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman subscribed to the newspaper, she was skeptical of paper's editorial
      slant to the Democratic party. In her  letter to Walt Whitman, she gave her fullest rejection of its
      politics: "the old eagle how i dislike it yet i take it if i dident see any
      other paper i should think andy [Johnson] was perfection and all the rest was
      crushed general grant in the bargain."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00510_n6">8. Ned is a folk name for the
      devil, so the phrase "raising old ned," like "raising the devil," signals that
      granddaughters Manahatta and Jessie Louisa were causing a disturbance or
      trouble.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n3">9. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
