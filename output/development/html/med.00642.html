   <p>I have just received your card,<sup><a href="#med.00642_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> dated 28th September, and I am very glad to hear that
      you have had so pleasant a summer, and that you are in better health.<sup><a href="#n0905" id="r2">2</a></sup> Long may you
      remain so, say I. Did you receive a letter I sent you some weeks ago, asking you to
      write four or six lines in an MS. poem by Walter Scott?<sup><a href="#med.00642_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> Not hearing from you, I fear
      you have not received it. If you have not received it, may I send it to you again,
      when I will explain my wishes? It will only occupy you for five minutes. I spent a
      very pleasant hour yesterday with Lowell. We smoked the pipe of
      good-fellowship. Tennyson is in Sussex, quite well. I shall send him your card.
