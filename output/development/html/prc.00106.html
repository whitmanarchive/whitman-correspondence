   <p>Am sitting here quietly—(rather dully)—to-day in the little down stairs
      room—nothing at all eventful or new with me—a dark sulky day outside,
      cold yet not quite cold enough to freeze—no visitors—have had my dinner
      &amp; relished it with appetite—went over to the theatre yesterday
      afternoon—Wilson Barrett<sup><a href="#loc.01370_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> sent over a carriage for
      me &amp; I had just a good ride, &amp; liked the play "Clito"<sup><a href="#prc.00106_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r3">3</a></sup> went with me, &amp; every thing was enjoyable—I
      was <em>made much of</em> &amp; got back (thro' a snow storm) just
      before sunset—So you see I <em>do</em> get around
      some—(when I am helped—not much of my own volition)—Alma, I shall
      have to draw on your good nature to accept [this thin?] gossip for a
      letter—thank you for yours, &amp; the girls' from Dresden, that came to me
      safely—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01370_n2">1. Wilson Barrett
      (1846–1904) was a British actor and playwright who was then performing in
      the United States. He played the lead role in <em>Clito</em>, a
      new blank-verse drama set in ancient Greece, written by the English dramatist
      Sydney Grundy (1848–1914) in collaboration with Barrett. Whitman was
      apparently quite taken with Barrett's acting and even met with him several times
      in early 1887.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00106_n2">2. <em>Clito</em>
      was a new blank-verse drama set in ancient Greece, written by the English
      dramatist Sydney Grundy (1848–1914) in collaboration with Barrett, who
      played the lead role.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6113">3. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_92.html">Davis, Mary Oakes (1837 or 1838–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0336">4. John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00106_n1">5. Probably Albert Johnston
      (see the letter from Whitman to Mannahatta Whitman of ). However, as Whitman's letter of  to John H. Johnston indicates, the
      reference may be to a new child.<a href="#r5">[back]
