   <p>Your card of 13th also newspaper and "Galaxy" article<sup><a href="#loc.07270_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> came to hand yesterday they were all most welcome. Of
      course I had the "Galaxy" article (have had it for years) but was glad to have
      another copy. All quiet here, no word from Wm Gurd,<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r2">2</a></sup> it begins to smell wintry, ground is white with snow this
      morning but not very cold yet. I see they have had it 12 below zero at
      Calgary—nice cool country that.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07270_n2">1. Whitman sent Bucke a
      set of galley proofs of John Burrough's "Walt Whitman and his <em>Drum Taps</em>," which appeared in <em>The Galaxy</em>
      (December 1, 1866), 606–615 (see Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.13.html">November 13, 1888</a>).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n4284">2. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
