   <p> I have sent through my publishers a 
      vol.
      
       of my essays on Poetry &amp; Poets, containing an essay on your own work,
      reprinted with additions from one I wrote some years ago—which I have been sorry
      not to see mentioned in the volumes of Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> and
      John Burroughs<sup><a href="#loc.02907_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—for  I understand that you, &amp; Mr.
      Burroughs had approved of it &amp; (as you know) I have long been a grateful &amp;
      warm admirer. Please let me have a line, if you are well enough, as I hope may be
      the case, to write. I welcome the 
      vol.
      
       of young Mr. Rhys,<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; trust it will make you
      well known among us. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p> If you should come to England, I hope you will not forget that you would find a warm
      welcome in our house.

      Ever yours with affectionate respect,

   </p>
   
   
   <p> P.S. I hope you may have seen &amp; cared for some of my own work in poetry. I
      believe I sent you an early  &amp; immature volume, but not hearing from you did not send
      later, &amp; stronger work.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Roden Noel (1834–1894) was an
      English poet, critic, and admirer of Whitman. Noel's "A Study of Walt Whitman:
      The Poet of Modern Democracy" (<em>Dark Blue</em> 2 [October
      1871], 241–253), spoke glowingly of the poet, describing him as "tall,
      colossal, luxuriant, unpruned, like some giant tree in a primeval forest. . . .
      He springs out of that vast American continent full-charged with all that is
      special and national in it" (242).

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.02907_n2">3. The naturalist John
      Burroughs (1837–1921) met Walt Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.
      C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to
      become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically
      drawn to Whitman. However, the correspondence between the two men is, as
      Burroughs acknowledged, curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write
      several books involving or devoted to Whitman's work: <em>Notes on
         Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em> (1867), <em>Birds and
         Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the Universe</em> (1924). For more on Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837-1921] and Ursula [1836-1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998). It is likely that Noel
      is referring to Burrough's 1877 publication here. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Burroughs, see Carmine Sarracino, "Burroughs, John
      [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]." <a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.03310_n1">4. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
