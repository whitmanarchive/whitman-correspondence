   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00478_n2">1. This letter dates to March
      21, 1867. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated this letter "March 21." Richard
      Maurice Bucke later assigned the year 1867, and Edwin Haviland Miller accepted
      Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:378). The year 1867 is confirmed by
      a previous mention of a penny that Jessie Louisa, daughter of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, had swallowed (see Louisa's
       letter to Walt Whitman), by
      Louisa's receipt of Walt Whitman's 
      letter, and by the recent death of Dr. Ruggles.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00478_n21">2. See Walt Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      Walt acknowledged receipt of "both your letters last week."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00478_n3">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years
      Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until
      the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg
      (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove
      (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Smith and later a mason named French. George
      initially relied on the significant sum that Louisa had husbanded for him from
      his military pay, but this letter is near the beginning of a two-year period
      during which George is financially overextended and begins to rely on loans from
      brothers Walt and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman. According to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt,
      Jeff agreed to lend George $200. For a review of the series of loans that Walt
      and Jeff had made to George, see her 
      letter to Walt. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>." <a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">4. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00478_n5">5. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde's (1823–1908) March 20, 1867 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      commended Walt Whitman's kindness; expressed Hannah's appreciation for Walt's
      forwarding of paper, money, and Louisa's letters; pressed her mother to again
      visit Vermont; and informed Louisa of some notices of Walt in periodicals.
      Hannah, Louisa's youngest daughter, resided in Burlington, Vermont, with her
      husband Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter (see Clarence
      Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp;
         Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North
      Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 209–211).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00440_n3">6. Manahatta Whitman
      (1860–1886), known as "Hattie," was the daughter of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven years of her life in
      the same home with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was especially close to her
      grandmother. Hattie and her younger sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957) were
      both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00478_n6">7. Burlington, Vermont was the
      home of Louisa's Van Velsor Whitman's daughter Hannah Heyde.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00478_n10">8. His cousin has not been
      identified, but Joseph Phineas Davis (1837–1917) shared the Pacific Street
      house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, her son Edward, and the family of Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman before Jeff's departure for St. Louis in 1867. Davis
      took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1856
      and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He was a
      topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned to
      Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00478_n9">9. A Mr. and Mrs. Rice in
      Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, were close friends of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman
      and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. The Rices joined Jeff and Mattie when they
      returned to St. Louis after the Whitman family's December 1867 trip to Brooklyn
      and were interested in boarding with the Whitmans in St. Louis (see Jeff's
      January 17, 1868 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, Dennis Berthold and
      Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of
         Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press,
      1984], 124, and Mattie's February 1, 1868 letter to Louisa, Randall H. Waldron,
      ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1977], 45).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00478_n11">10. Julius "Jules" Mason
      (1835–1882) was a lieutenant colonel in the Fifth Cavalry and a career
      army officer. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman wrote that Mason "used to be in my
      party on the Water Works" (see his  letter to Walt Whitman). Jules Mason's sister Irene was a close
      friend of Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman, and Randall H.
      Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 37, 42). Jules and
      Irene were the children of Gordon F. Mason, a prominent Pennsylvania
      businessman. When Jeff departed for St. Louis in early May 1867, Mattie stayed
      at the Mason home in Towanda, Pennsylvania (Waldron, 37).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">11. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00478_n8">12. Jessie Louisa "Sis" Whitman,
      daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman, had swallowed a penny (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). Louisa was
      answering Walt's query about Sis's penny (see his  letter to Louisa). Walt replied to this letter with gratitude
      that "sis's penny had a safe journey" (see his  letter to Louisa).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n20">13. "California" was a nickname
      for Jessie Louisa Whitman (1863–1957), the younger daughter of Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. Though Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman referred most often to her granddaughter as "Sis"—a
      nickname that Jessie Louisa inherited when her older sister Manahatta became
      "Hattie"—Walt Whitman apparently bestowed the private nickname
      "California" on Jessie Louisa shortly after her birth (see his  letter), and it was Walt's
      preferred nickname for his niece. Another source for the nickname's origin may
      be the adaptation of a slang term for money—"california it is full of
      tents"—from an exclamation that Louisa made upon seeing soldiers gathered
      on Fort Greene in Brooklyn (see her  letter to Walt).<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00478_n14">14. The name of the "captain"
      and the "contest taken by the alabamans" are unclear. If a ship captain, it
      cannot be Homer C. Blake, the captain of the <em>USS
         Hatteras</em>, the only Union warship taken by the <em>CSS
         Alabama</em>, because Blake was not a Brooklyn resident. Perhaps this
      captain commanded one of the many merchant vessels taken by the warship <em>CSS Alabama</em> during its career as a commerce raider. Or
      this captain may have been associated with a Union defeat in the land
      war.<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00478_n7">15. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      presumably refers to an article in the <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Times</em> by the newspaper's former title. George C. Bennet's <em>Williamsburgh Times</em> was renamed the<em>Brooklyn Daily Times</em> in 1855. Walt Whitman worked at the paper from
      1857 to 1859. See Walt Whitman, Emory Holloway, and Vernolian Schwarz, <em>I Sit and Look Out: Editorials from the Brooklyn Daily
         Times</em> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1955), 12–20.<a href="#r15">[back]
