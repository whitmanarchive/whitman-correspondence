   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

<div class="editorial_notes">
   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00480_n16">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      dated the letter only to a Saturday. The date assigned by Richard Maurice Bucke,
      April 27, 1867, is defensible. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date
      (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 1:378).The letter's contents seem to match the
      period between Thomas Jefferson Whitman's offer of employment at the St. Louis
      Water Works and his departure for the position. And if so, this letter
      corresponds also to the appearance of Eugene Benton's appraisal of Walt Whitman
      in the April 1867 <em>Galaxy</em>. However, a review to which
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman refers from the previous "thursday times," which would
      be April 25, 1867 if the date is correct, raises significant doubts with regard
      to the date of this letter. Louisa reports that she encloses a clipping from the
      "thursday times" in which Whitman is labeled the "only american poet." If she
      has misnamed the newspaper, she may refer to Ferdinand Freiligrath's "Walt
      Whitman" (<em>Boston Commonwealth</em>, July 4, 1868) or possibly
      to an unknown article in the <em>London Saturday Review</em> that
      Horace Traubel dates September 21, 1867. Either article, if enclosed, would
      change the date of this letter. If the sentiment is more general and not a
      direct quotation, the most likely newspaper for the enclosed clipping is the <em>Brooklyn Daily Times</em> or the <em>New York
         Times</em>. If a later date is proposed, it should correspond to a recent
      visit to Brooklyn by Thomas Jefferson Whitman. Another factor is George
      Washington Whitman's work for Moses Lane on the "new mane that was laid last
      fall." George is also said to be working on the "new main" in Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's  and  letters to Walt. If Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's phrase "only american poet" is a quote from an article, this letter's
      date is incorrect. If her phrase is not a quotation, April 27, 1867, or any
      Saturday in April is a reasonable date for this letter.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00480_n2">2. If the letter dates late
      April 1867, is not certain what "recreations" Louisa Van Velsor Whitman has in
      mind. On  Walt Whitman wrote that he
      had a visit from William O'Connor, that he visited soldiers in a hospital, and
      that he spent some time listening to the bells of the St. Aloysius Church. A
      week earlier, he had attended a concert (see Walt's  letter to Louisa).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">4. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00480_n11">5. If the letter dates April
      1867, Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's travel and shortness of funds are
      connected to an offer that he received in early March 1867 to become the chief
      engineer of the St. Louis Water Works. He began work in St. Louis on May 7,
      1867. Though a letter from Jeff Whitman to Walt Whitman informing him of the
      offer is not extant, see Jeff Whitman's  enclosure in his letter to Walt that he directed to William D.
      O'Connor. On Jeff's St. Louis offer, see Walt Whitman's  letter to Jeff Whitman and the notes for Jeff
      Whitman's  letter to Walt.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00480_n5">6. In "Literature and the
      People" Eugene Benson counts Whitman among "noble literary contemporaries" as
      the representative of American poetry, because he is among a group of writers
      who have "corrected us, moved us, liberated us" (<em>The
         Galaxy</em> 3 [April 1867], 875). For the poet's relationship with Benson
      and <em>The Galaxy</em>, see Robert J. Scholnick, "," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 13 (Spring 1996),
      189–198.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00480_n15">7. Neither the <em>New York Times</em> of April 25, 1867, a Thursday, nor of the
      day preceding or following, has a mention of Walt Whitman. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman may refer to the <em>Brooklyn Daily Times</em>, but the
      brief review to which the letter refers is not known.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00480_n19">8. The earliest claimed
      reference of Walt Whitman as the "only American poet" appeared in the September
      21, 1867 issue of the <em>London Saturday Review</em>, according
      to Horace Traubel (<em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/whole.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906],
      1:242). The first verified reference to Walt Whitman as the "only American
      poet," however, is usually credited to Ferdinand Freiligrath ("Walt Whitman,"
      <em>Boston Commonwealth</em>, July 4, 1868). Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman spoke well of Freiligrath's article in his  letter to Walt Whitman. If Louisa's
      letter refers to a comment or selection from either of these articles, the
      letter cannot date to April 1867.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00647_n2">9. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. He later
      designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city
      engineer. For more information on Walt Whitman's dealings with Lane, see
      Whitman's  letter to Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n5">10. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
      later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
      Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
      pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
      correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
      poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00480_n8">11. John Burroughs
      (1837–1921) met Walt Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864.
      After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a
      lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs wrote several books involving
      or devoted to Whitman's work: <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</em> (1867), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting
         the Universe</em> (1924). Ursula North (1836–1917) married John
      Burroughs in 1857 and also became a friend to Walt Whitman. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the Burroughs family, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John (1837–1921) and Ursula
         (1836–1917)</a>."<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00480_n9">12. William Conant Church
      (1836–1917) and his brother Francis Pharcellus Church (1839–1906)
      established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. For a time, the Churches
      considered Walt Whitman a regular contributor, printing several of his poems,
      including "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00192.html">A Carol of Harvest for 1867</a>," "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00027.html">Brother of All, With Generous Hand</a>," "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00022.html">Warble for Lilac-Time</a>," and "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00008.html">O Star of France</a>."
