      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Down here for a few days<sup><a href="#upa.00199_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I thought you would like to get
      news right from the midst of people &amp; scenes you loved so well—I came down
      yesterday amid sousing rain &amp; cloudy weather—but this forenoon it is
      sunshiny &amp; delightful—I have just returned from a two hours ramble in the
      old woods—wintry &amp; bare, &amp; yet lots of holly &amp; laurel—&amp;
      I only wish I could send you some cedary branches thick with the china-blue little
      plums, so pretty amid the green tufts—
   </p>
   
   <p>The Staffords are all well—Mrs S is much as usual, looks in good
      condition—I heard her singing this morning at her work in the kitchen before I
      was up—George has been well, &amp; is so—Ed &amp; Debby &amp; Harry
      &amp; Mont &amp; Van &amp; Ruth &amp; little George all right—Jo Browning
      ditto—Jo &amp; D had some company here to supper last evening—Harry is
      away at the RR office at Clementon (Narrow Gauge)—likes it—is home only
      at long intervals—Ed tends the store, &amp; the nag Ned<sup><a href="#upa.00199_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> looks as well as ever—it is now nearly
      12—&amp; we are going to have chicken for dinner—My morning paper has
      just come from 
      Phila:
      
       &amp; I will knock off &amp; read it—
   </p>
   
   <p>Dec 31—Saturday noon—Well this is the last day of the year, &amp; it has
      grown freezing cold—Mr S is out at the wood-pile chopping away—I hear
      the sound of his axe as I write—Mont went off early, he goes over to Clementon
      and works at telegraphy, learning &amp; assisting Harry—comes home quite
      late—Ed is busy with customers in the store—Ruth is in the kitchen
      making mince pies for New Year's—Mrs S is just sitting down a spell in the old
      rocking chair, reading to-day's 
      Phila:
      
       Ledger—the 
      acc't
      
       of the Guiteau
      trial<sup><a href="#upa.00199_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—(I don't know whether you read it or
      not, but of all the strange things of this strange century, I am not sure but that
      trial is the strangest)—
   </p>
   
   <p>We had a flurry of snow last evening, &amp; it looks wintry enough to-day, but the
      sun is out, &amp; I take my walks in the woods. Hienikin was here
      yesterday—Wesley Stafford &amp; his wife (Lizzie Hyder you know) have just
      drove up—they are very comfortable at the old place by the pond, &amp; Lizzie
      is reconciled &amp; happy—
   </p>
   
   <p>Herb, I thought you would just like to hear all the small news &amp; gossip &amp; so
      I have written it—O how shocking I felt at the sad sad sudden death of the
      dear one<sup><a href="#upa.00199_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—was a long time before I realized it as
      true—hope your dear mother—to whom I send best love—is beginning
      to feel something like herself again—tell her I 
      rec'd
      
       hers of Dec 14, &amp;
      will write before long<sup><a href="#upa.00199_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—All here speak of you with
      love, &amp; send affectionate remembrances—My best love to Giddy<sup><a href="#upa.00199_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—
   </p>

      was a real talk with you. I dont know why I punish myself by writing to you so
      seldom now, for indeed to be near you, even in that way would do me
      good—often &amp; often do I wish we were back in America near you" (<em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em>, ed.
