   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John W. Tilton was a lawyer and
      politician from Haverhill, Massachusetts. He was an active member of his local
      school board, and was elected to his state's House of Representatives by a very
      narrow margin in 1878.

   <p id="n4188">2. Whitman often referred to <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888) as his "big book." With
      the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made the presswork and binding decisions,
      and Frederick Oldach bound the volume, which included a profile photo of the
      poet on the title page. Philadelphia publisher David McKay published the book in
      December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r2">[back]
