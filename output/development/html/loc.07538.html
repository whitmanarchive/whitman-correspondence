   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0817">2. Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n0590">3. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      of Whitman's caregivers. He would leave on July 15, 1888, to resume his medical
      training. Baker was replaced by W.A. Musgrove. For Whitman's comments on the
      transition, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in

      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4319">7. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert

      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;

      Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontaria, Canada, and Minister of the
      Crown. Pardee appointed Richard Maurice Bucke, with whom he was a close friend,
      as the Superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane in Hamilton at its founding
      in 1876, and then the next year as Superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane
      in London. For more on Pardee, see H. V. Nelles, "Pardee, Timothy Blair," <em>Dictionary of Canadian Biography</em> Vol. 11 (Toronto:

      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

   <p id="n4267">13. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on

   <p id="loc.05536_n4">15. The English poet and
      critic Matthew Arnold (1822–1888) first came to America on a lecture tour
      in October, 1883, and remained until March, 1884. He "returned to England
      confirmed by experience in his conception of the average American as a hard
      uninteresting type of Philistine." After a second trip to the United States in
      the summer of 1886, Arnold commented on American life being "uninteresting, so
      without savour and without depth" (Stuart P. Sherman, <em>Matthew
         Arnold</em> [Indianapolis, 1917], 46–49).<a href="#r15">[back]

   <p id="loc.07538_n3">16. Matthew Arnold's essay,
      "Heinrich Heine," in which he calls the German poet and essayist
      (1797–1856) the "the successor and continuator of Goethe" as a "soldier in
      the war of liberation of humanity," was part of Arnold's <em>Essays in Criticism</em> (1865).<a href="#r16">[back]

   <p id="n3044">17. "George Eliot" was the pen name of
      Mary Ann Evans (1819–1880), one of the most influential British writers of
      the nineteenth century. Her works include <em>The Mill on the
         Floss</em> (1860), <em>Middlemarch</em> (1871–1872), and
      <em>Daniel Deronda</em> (1876). Whitman was especially
      enamored by Eliot's essay writing: "She is profound, masterful: her analysis is
      perfect: she chases her game without tremor to the very limit of its endurance"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.109.html">Wednesday, October 31, 1888</a>).<a href="#r17">[back]
