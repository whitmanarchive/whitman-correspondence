      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt;
      
   </p>
   
   <p> We returned from our wanderings last week. On the whole had a fairly good time. I
      had a good glimpse of a large
      section of the country. I spent 10 days in Washington, then went to Ky. where I stayed
      till 1st of
      June, &amp; joined wife<sup><a href="#n0892" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; Julian<sup><a href="#loc.01151_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> in Chicago June 5th. I found Wm O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r4">4</a></sup> 
      better than I expected to; his mind  seems clear
      &amp; strong, &amp; his lameness not very bad. But there is probably little chance of his
      ever being any better. A sea voyage is the thing for him, but he will not go. He has
      probably got that horrible disease called <u>progressive locomotor
         ataxia</u> I saw him several times at his office. He felt a little insecure in
      his place, but I don't believe he will be disturbed. Washington was very beautiful
      &amp; I was glad to be
      there again. My sleep was very poor while in Ky, but I think of it as the finest 
      country I have yet seen—that is the blue grass 
      region of it; much ahead of anything I saw in Ill. or 
      Ind. or Ohio. I went to St Louis, &amp; sailed from there up to Quincy on the 
      Missippi.  
       
       I was ten days in Chicago, the N.Y. of the west, &amp; destined to be an
      enormous city. We stopped at Cleveland with friends, then at Niagara &amp; at Utica.
      Julian saw many wonders &amp; got many ideas. I am very glad to be home again. It is
      getting to be a great bore for me to gad about to see things. I hope you are better
      than when I saw you. You should make a determined attempt to keep your bowells open.
       It makes me
      shudder when I remember what you said about their torpidity. I could not live a
      month so. Your head would be all right if you could keep your bowells open. Frank
      Baker<sup><a href="#loc.01155_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> said that an outward movement, such as chafing &amp;  
      kneeding
      
       of them by the hands would be a great help. Why can you not have your boy
      do that for 1/2 hour each day, also drink a good deal of water. Hathern Spring water<sup><a href="#loc.01155_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> from Saratoga would be good. Also a
      wet towel over the liver. Drop me a line how you are, &amp; if you have any plan to
      get away from C. for the summer. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      (1836–1917) was John Burroughs's wife. Ursula and John were married on
      September 12, 1857. The couple maintained a small farm overlooking the Hudson
      River in West Park, Ulster County. They adopted a son, Julian, at two months of
      age. It was only later revealed that John himself was the biological father of
      Julian.<a href="#r2">[back]

      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
