      <br></br><br></br>Friend Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I received a letter from you last March and answered it while at Fort Union<sup><a href="#loc.00591_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>, but have never heard from you since.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well here I am camped on a sand bank on the Rio Grande River the weather is hot and
      we have seen little of the good things of America in the shape of Grub and Clothing
      but we have a Regament composed of natures Noblemen. we left Denver poorly clothed
      and equipped in the month of February, marched to Fort Union a distance of four hundred
      miles in fifteen days, two days we marched forty miles a day and then hearing that
      the Texans were marching on Fort Union we marched over seventy miles in twenty four
      hours. I believe that was the best marching made by any Reg in the Service. We being
      short of provision and destitute of Clothing our men stood it bravely and never murmured.<sup><a href="#loc.00591_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The Texans flushed with success having whipped three thousand Regulars and volunteer
      Mexican troops at Fort Craig were marching boldly on towards Fort Union laying the
      country waste wherever they went. We all eager to try our Reg. marched one hundred
      miles and met the enemy on their own ground in Apache Country in the mountains   our
      force of nine hundred theirs of two thousand we fought seven hours some times hand
      to hand over rocks stumps and trees regular bush whacking Indian fighting the Texans
      loss was about five hundred killed and wounded, ours about one hundred and eighty
      we burned sixty of their wagons loaded with provisions, clothing, ammunition and valuables
      leaving them destitute<sup><a href="#loc.00591_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> they commenced their retreat the next day we followed a few days after joined Gen
      Canbys<sup><a href="#loc.00591_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> force at Alberquerque, drove the ensuing two hundred miles like a flock of sheep
      At Peralta we had another little battle where we took seven wagons and a number of
      Prisoners   they said they did not mind fighting Regular troops but there was no use
      fighting Chivingtons Grey blouse Pikes Peak Sons of bitches so they burned all they
      had and fled to the mountains making for Texas with all possible speed and I am inclined to believe that they will never have any inclination
      to come to New Mexico again. Our Colonel Chivington was a Methodist Preacher Presiding
      elder in Colorado he is about six feet four inches high and built in proportion a
      first rate fellow and liked by his Regiment.
   </p>
   
   <p>We have marching orders now to join Col Carlton's<sup><a href="#loc.00591_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> California troops about three hundred miles south of here   I expect we will start
      in about a week. we are getting tired of lying still although we have our sports,
      to night we have a swimming match for a purse of $30. they are to swim across the
      Rio Grande our Boys have built houses for themselves some of mud some of willow and
      some have dug houses in the bank by the River and live quite comfortable. I am afraid
      you will not find much in this letter to interest you for I am in no humor for writing
      to day. I may do better next time   I hope to hear from you before long,
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Silas S. Soule
      (1838â€“1865) was raised by an abolitionist father, Amasa Soule, who moved
      the Soule family to Kansas to help fight for Kansas's anti-slavery status. With
      his father and brother William, Silas was a member of the "Jayhawkers," a band
      of abolitionists who assisted slaves through the Underground Railroad. Silas was
      among the Kansas team assembled and brought to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania by
      Richard Swinton to break John Brown's accomplices Albert Hazlett and Aaron
      Stevens out of jail in Charlestown, Virginia (now West Virginia). In Harrisburg
      he would have met William W. Thayer, who helped Richard Hinton and Thomas
      Wentworth Higginson plan the jailbreak. On February 18, 1860, Soule went to
      Charlestown from Harrisburg and faked public intoxication in order to be
      imprisoned in the same jail as Hazlett and Stevens, only to be talked out of the
      jailbreak by them. Soule attended a public memorial for Hazlett and Stevens in
      Boston, where Thayer and Eldridge were in attendance. After the death of his
      father in 1860, Soule followed the gold rush to Denver, but enlisted in the
      Union army as soon as news of the war reached him. In 1864 Soule defied orders
      by refusing to join Colonel John M. Chivington's attack on a group of unarmed
      Native Americans, which later came to be known as the Sand Creek Massacre. Soule
      would later testify against Chivington in hearings in Denver. Soule married
      Hersa Coberly, the daughter of a pioneer family, on April 1, 1865. Three weeks
      later he was murdered on the streets of downtown Denver by a private from the
      Second Colarado infantry and an accomplice.
