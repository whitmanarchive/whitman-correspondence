   <p>Your letter of 4<u>th</u><sup><a href="#loc.07324_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> enclosing Mrs Costelloe's<sup><a href="#n6109" id="r3">3</a></sup> to hand this afternoon—both letters entirely
      welcome. I am exceedingly sorry for Mrs Costelloe<sup><a href="#loc.07324_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> but the fact is the life she went
      in for (an attempt to carry all London on her back) was simply suicidal. Should she
      fully recover from this breakdown (as I trust and think she will) she will no doubt
      be wiser and do better in future. Have just been up at the patient's dance for half
      an hour—some 400 people in the hall having quite a time—we have a new
      hall this year nearly twice as big as the old one and only up one stair which is
      quite an improvement on
      the old hall (where you were at chapel once) up three flights. Letter from Willy
      Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r5">5</a></sup> today—nothing in it—does not say a word as
      to when he will be through and return here. But I guess it is all right and that he
      will be here soon. Yes, I fear you are dull enough mais, courage mon Ami! Never say
      die! When the meter turns into money (which may be sooner than we think) I am going
      to see if I can't do something to cheer you up a little—in the meantime it is
      grand to see you keep up as well as you do—and actually gaining if any thing
      as the months pass—we might have some good quiet times together yet if the 
      Lord pleases—and if not? well, we will say "all right any how"

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n6109">3. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." For more information
      about Costelloe, see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="loc.07324_n2">4. With his , letter to Bucke, Whitman had enclosed an
      , letter from Robert Pearsall Smith,
      Mary Costelloe's father, in which Smith informed the poet that his daughter "is
      under a nervous break-down—not suffering much but compelled to great
      quiet."<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n4284">5. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
