      <br></br><br></br>Dear W. W.<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.02992_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Just as my MS pkg was consigned to steamer Roman of the Warren Line, comes crawling
      along—like a fly in molasses— one of Fred. W. Wilson's<sup><a href="#loc.03316_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> idiotic little letters asking to see the MS. before
      agreeing to give
      me copyright, and assure me seeing of proofs &amp;c—mere trifles. I distrust him, &amp; think
      him
      incompetent. However, if Gardner<sup><a href="#n4318" id="r3">3</a></sup> declines we will fall back on
      the tortoise. He can't say I did not give him every chance.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad that you had Bucke's<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> Sarrazin<sup><a href="#n3115" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      translation too, if it pleased <u>you.</u> It is first rate,
      gives parts I omitted, &amp; good ones too.<sup><a href="#loc.02992_n1" id="r6">6</a></sup> It is just as I told you: the article is
      strong &amp; adequate. The Dr. in his haste (&amp; I suspect you slyly inveigled him as you
      did me) misses the point twice. Sarrazin does not say that Hegel is the greatest of
      the philosophers <u>after Whitman</u>: he says Hegel is the
      greatest &amp;c <u>according to</u> Whitman. <u>Après</u> means <u>after</u>; but <u>d'après</u> (used by Sarrazin: I saw it in the article at Harvard Library
      again to-day) means <u>according to</u>, or <u>in the opinion of</u>, <u>on the authority of</u>, &amp; always
      embodies that idea.
   </p>
   
   <p>Again our good Dr. misses it in the condor business. Here is Sarrazin: He says where
      the
      details are removed from Leaves of Grass.
   </p>
   
   <p>vous vous apercevez immédiatement que la vie et la variété se sont
      retirées du tableau et qu'il n'est plus traversé que de grands et
      monotones coups d'ailes de condor.
      <p>you
         perceive immediately that the life of the variety themselves have taken away
         from the picture, and that it is no more traversed except by great &amp; monotonous
         strokes of wing of the condor.
      </p> (But Dr. B. gives the exact opposite of
      the true rendering in his translation)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I don't think I have seen the article by O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r7">7</a></sup> you allude to.
   </p>
   
   <p>very cold to-day. Feb. 25 '89</p>
   
   <p>What a fine Lowell<sup><a href="#n1026" id="r8">8</a></sup> number the Critic has (too <u>much</u> taffy;
      but good reading some of it.)
   </p>
   ———
   
   <p>Bucke's "a banditti of politicians" is funny; in English it means "a robbers of
      politicians."!
   </p>
   ———
   
   <p>If I had tho't we cd have got a [illegible].
      I shd have taken several days (instead of two hours) &amp; made a careful exclusive translation
      of the bulk of
      the piece. However, it is just as well.
   </p>
   
   <p>It <u>grieves me much</u>, dear friend I hear of those pains
      "inside night &amp; day." Dear me, can't you get rid of 'em?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br> William Sloane Kennedy,
      biographer, editor, and critic, was one of Whitman's most devoted friends and
      admirers. Kennedy first met Whitman in Philadelphia in 1880 while working on the
      staff of the <em>American</em>. He soon became a frequent
      correspondent and visitor to Whitman's Camden, New Jersey, home, a constant
      contributor of small gifts, and the author of several essays and newspaper
      articles in praise of Whitman. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine
      Reagan,"<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>"" Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02992_n2">1. This letter is addresssed:
      Walt Whitman | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked: North Cambridge, Sta. Mass
      | Feb | 26 | 8am | 1889; Camden, N.J. | Feb | 27 | 10am | Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.03316_n2">2. Frederick W. Wilson was a
      member of the Glasgow firm of Wilson &amp; McCormick that published the 1883
      British edition of <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4318">3. Alexander Gardner (1821–1882)
      of Paisley, Scotland, was a publisher who reissued a number of books by and
      about Whitman; he ultimately published William Sloane Kennedy's <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> in 1896 after a long and
      contentious battle with Kennedy over editing the book. Gardner published and
      co-edited the <em>Scottish Review</em> from 1882 to 1886.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3115">5. Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935)
      was a translator and poet from France, who commented positively not only on
      Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and
      apparently liked the critic's work on <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>—Whitman even had Sarrazin's chapter on his book translated
      twice. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02992_n1">6. Whitman asked both Kennedy
      and the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke to translate into English an
      abstract of Sarrazin's "Poétes moderns de l'amérique, Walt Whitman,"
      <em>La Nouvelle Revue</em>, 52 (May 1888), 164–84 (see
      Whitman's letter to Kennedy of ,
      and to Bucke of ). Sarrazin's
      piece has been reprinted in an English translation by Harrison S. Morris in <em>In Re</em> (pp. 159–94).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">7. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1026">8. James Russell Lowell
      (1819–1891), one of Whitman's famous poetic contemporaries, was committed
      to conventional poetic form, which was clearly at odds with Whitman's more
      experimental form. Still, as editor of the <em>Atlantic
         Monthly</em>, he published Whitman's "Bardic Symbols," probably at Ralph
      Waldo Emerson's suggestion. Lowell later wrote a tribute to Abraham Lincoln
      titled "Commemoration Ode," which has often, since its publication, been
      contrasted with Whitman's own tribute, "O Captain! My Captain!"<a href="#r8">[back]
