      ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, <em xmlns="">Washington</em>,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Aug 26, 1865.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter from Dewittville came safe, about nine days ago—&amp; I have been expecting
      to hear from you since. Byron, I am still here, and as far as appears at present am
      likely to remain employed here, through the fall—but may ask for leave of absence
      for two or three weeks before long. There is a great stream of Southerners comes in
      here day after day, to get <em>pardoned</em>—All the rich, and all high officers of the rebel army cannot do any thing, cannot
      buy or sell, &amp;c. until they have special pardons—(that is hitting them where they
      <em>live</em>)—so they all send or come up here in squads, old &amp; young, men &amp; women—
   </p>
   
   <p>They come to this office to get them—sometimes the rooms are filled with a curious
      gathering—I talk with them frequently, listen to their stories, descriptions, opinions
      &amp;c. &amp;c—As you know, almost every thing of that sort (&amp; especially all odd characters)
      are interesting to me—Some 4 or 5000 pardons have been passed through here—but the
      President hasn't signed more than 200—The rest are all blank yet—Andy Johnson seems
      disposed to be in no hurry about it—What I learn &amp; know about him (the President),
      I think he is a <em>good man</em>.<sup><a href="#sjs.00001_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Byron, there is nothing new or special with me. I have changed my back room to the
      front room, &amp; have my meals sent up by the landlady—She gives me very good grub, &amp;
      I like it, both room &amp; board, ($32.50 a month)—The last ten or twelve days here have
      been very pleasant &amp; sufficiently cool—after the melting hot summer—I am writing this
      in the office, by my big window, looking out on a splendid view across &amp; down the
      Potomac for several miles, &amp; over into Virginia, along Arlington heights—The trees,
      grass, river, &amp; sky are splendid.
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, my dear comrade, how are you, &amp; how does it go? You must write &amp; let me hear
      about you—&amp; I shall want to know also if you get this. I wish it was so we could see
      each other, &amp; be together once in a while. Well, Byron, I must close. I send you my
      love, &amp; God bless you, dearest comrade—Write soon, dear son, &amp; give me all particulars.<sup><a href="#sjs.00001_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Whitman corresponded with
      Byron Sutherland, a soldier, between 1865 and 1870. On September 20, 1868, he
      wrote to Sutherland: "I retain just the same friendship I formed for you the
      short time we were together, (but intimate,) in 1865" (Henry W. and Albert A.
      Berg Collection, New York Public Library; Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:44–45).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="sjs.00001_n2">1. In his jottings for
      "Sept. 8, 9 &amp;c.," Whitman noted that Johnson was signing the pardons "very
      freely of late. The President, indeed, as at present appears, has fix'd his mind
      on a very generous and forgiving course toward the return'd secessionists"
      (Bucke, <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New York,
      G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 6:219).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="sjs.00001_n3">2. Sutherland replied on
      , from Corry, a lumber and
      oil center in Pennsylvania. He was working on a farm and "managing to save $30
      per month," had "considerable leisure time" for "light reading," and expected
      during the winter to "learn a trade or go to School." See also Whitman's letter
      of
