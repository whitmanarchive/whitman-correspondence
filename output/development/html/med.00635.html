   <p>After I left you<sup><a href="#med.00635_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I went to Colorado, &amp; there &amp; in Missouri have spent the time since—came back here
      about a week ago—I sent you a little Volume—also two little pictures—You take the
      one you prefer &amp; give the other to Linton—Send me word if they come safe. I am all
      right in health.

   <p id="med.00635_n1">1. The son of Judge Usher,
      with whom Whitman had stayed at Lawrence, Kansas (see the letter from Walt
      Whitman to Louisa Whitman of ). On the same day he sent to the son a copy of <em>Memoranda During the War</em> and two photographs, one of which was
      intended for Linton J. Usher, probably the brother of Judge Usher (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
