   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="amh.00013_n1">1. Walter Godey was
      Whitman's replacement at the Attorney General's office, starting August 14, 1873
      (see Whitman's  of introduction for Godey to
      chief clerk Webster Elmes). Whitman subsequently sent payment for Godey's
      service through Eldridge on , and
      . On , Whitman wrote Peter Doyle that "I got a letter from
      Mr. Eldridge that he had paid Godey, my substitute, the money I sent on for his
      October pay." It was clearly Whitman's routine to send Godey's money order on
      the twenty-ninth of each month (see also Whitman's letter to Eldridge of ). Therefore, this (possibly
      draft) letter would seem to date from either October or November 1873, as
      Whitman's correspondence with Eldridge has also been lost for November. However,
      his opinions of his health seem less optimistic during that month. Whitman's
      letters in October routinely begin in the same way this fragment does: "I am
      still doing as well as when I last wrote" on , and "My condition remains about the same" on . Thus it seems likely that a
      version of this letter was sent around October 29, 1873.<a href="#r1">[back]
