   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0590">1. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="man.00001_n1">2. This letter is written on
      a small card, and is in an envelope addressed, in Whitman's own hand, to "Walt
      Whitman London Ontario Canada"—he sent self-addressed envelopes to Harry
      and his family in order to encourage them to write while he was on his Canadian
      trip. The envelope is postmarked: 17 July 1880 at Kirkwood, New Jersey.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="man.00001_n2">3. Stafford conserved space on
      the page through crosshatch writing, leaving parts of the letter nearly
      illegible.<a href="#r3">[back]
