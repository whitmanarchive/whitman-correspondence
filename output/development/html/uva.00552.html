   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
