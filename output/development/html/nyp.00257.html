      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, mother, Jeff has been to see me at last—he left yesterday morning—I wish he
      could have staid a few days longer—He seemed to be well pleased with his visit, &amp;
      I am sure it was a great comfort to me—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rather like my new quarters—at any rate they are better than where I was previously—they
      are very good on some accounts, &amp; not so good on others—but one must not expect perfection.
      When you write tell me how Jeff got home—We are having pleasant weather here now—the
      ice &amp; snow are all gone—Mother, do you see the papers much? I can send papers to you,
      only they would be rather old by the time you get them. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, mother, I left my letter awhile, &amp; have been out taking a walk, &amp; now return
      &amp; finish my letter—It is quite like summer—I looked for an Almanac but couldn't find
      any to suit me—I am going out to Georgetown, &amp; will find one there—I will send it
      to-morrow<sup><a href="#nyp.00257_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup>—The O'Connors are much pleased with Jeff—Mrs. O'Connor has taken a real liking to
      him—<sup><a href="#nyp.00257_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I hope this will find you relieved of your rheumatism—I send my love to Matty &amp; George
      &amp; all.<sup><a href="#nyp.00257_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
