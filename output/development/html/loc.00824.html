   </p>
   
   <p>There is nothing from the army more than you know, in the N Y papers—the fighting
      has been hard enough, but the papers make lots of additional items, &amp; a good deal
      that they just entirely make up—there are from 600 to 1000 wounded coming up here—(not 6 to 8000 as the papers have it)<sup><a href="#loc.00824_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I cannot hear what part the 9th corps took in the fight, of Friday &amp; afterwards,
      nor whether they really took any at all—(they, the papers, are determined to make
      up just any thing)—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I rec'd your letter &amp; Han's—&amp; was glad indeed to get both—Mother, you must not be under such apprehension, as I think it is not warranted<sup><a href="#loc.00824_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>So far as we get news here, we are gaining the day, so far, <em>decidedly</em>—if the news we hear is true that Lee has been repulsed &amp; driven back by Grant, &amp; that we are masters of the field, &amp; pursuing them—then I think Lee will retreat,
      south—&amp; Richmond will be abandoned by the rebs—but of course time only can develope what will happen—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I will write again Wednesday, or before if I hear any thing to write—love
      to Jeff &amp; Mat &amp; all—
   </p>

      Whitman's letter is not extant, but Hannah Heyde Whitman wrote, on May 10, 1864,
      an hysterical letter about George Whitman's safety: "Mother, will you <em>be sure</em> and send me word the minute you hear that he is
      safe. I am like you, I cannot see a bit of peace till I hear. I feel this time
      as if he would be safe, and, Mother, if he only is, I will try to never complain
      again of anything as long as I live" (The Library of Congress). Of the Whitmans,
      only Walt Whitman apparently remained impassive. George had not helped matters
      when he noted in his letter of : "I
      hear that Grant has issued an order, that no letters will be allowed to be sent
      from this army for the next Sixty days" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke
      University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library).<a href="#r2">[back]
