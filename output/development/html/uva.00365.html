   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00365_n2">1. It is not known whether this
      letter was mailed. According to Gay Wilson Allen, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      wrote out the note for her children just before Walt Whitman's arrival on May
      20, 1873: Walt was summoned because his mother's death was imminent (see <em>The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</em>
      [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 452). Whether sent as a letter, only intended to be
      sent, or composed without the intent to send, Mother Whitman's deathbed letter
      to her children and to her "beloved walter" dates to May 17–20,
      1873.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00365_n3">2. The wording of the public
      death notice—presumably written by Walt Whitman—echoes Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman's emphasis on the word "beloved": "WHITMAN.—At
      Camden, N. J., early on the morning of May 23d, 1873, in the 78th year of
      her age, Mrs. Louisa Whitman, widow of the late Walter Whitman, of Brooklyn,
      N. Y., and beloved mother of Walt Whitman, of Washington, George Whitman, of
      Camden, and Thos. J. Whitman, of St. Louis. Buried on Monday afternoon, May
      26th, in Evergreen Cemetery, Camden" ("Died," <em>Camden
         Democrat</em>, May 31, 1873, 3).<br><br>
      Louisa also addressed Walt as "beloved" in her  letter.<a href="#r2">[back]
