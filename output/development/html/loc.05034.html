   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward H. Hames (1844–1922)
      served as business manager of the monthly journal <em>The Literary
         World</em> after he and editor Edward Abbott purchased the journal from its
      founder, Samuel R. Crocker, in 1877. Hames worked with the Boston-based journal
      until 1903.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3036">1. Whitman's relationship with the <em>The Literary World</em> changed over the years. In 1888, the
      poet recalled: "The Literary World started out years ago with being
      friendly—almost fulsome, eulogistic: its head man was Abbot: I had several
      letters from Abbot, written in a friendly temper: displaying a friendly feeling
      for me. The other man, the money man, on The World, was Hines [...] At that time
      [1880] they wanted me to send them something for an Emerson number of The World
      [...] I sent them the piece— [...] But this friendly disposition came to
      an end. There was a time when the question of W. W. came up—Abbot must
      have been overborne: yet, whatever the policy of the paper, more recent letters
      from Abbot—personal letters—have in substance repeated his original
      judgment" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 9 vols.,
      3:274–275).<a href="#r1">[back]
