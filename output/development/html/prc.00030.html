   </p>
   
   
   <p>The address I want you to send the Tax &amp; Revenue books, reports, documents, or whatever
      to is
      
      
      <br><br>To Paul Liptay<sup><a href="#prc.00030_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      <br>Care of Otto Behrens<sup><a href="#prc.00030_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      <br>140 Eighth avenue

   <p>I wrote to Nelly about a week ago, stating my condition, &amp; what a plight I have been
      in—&amp; am partially yet—though slowly coming round to what I was just previous—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The doctor still comes every day—rather a curious fellow—a great bully, vehement,
      loud words 
      &amp; plenty of them (the very reverse of my valued Dr Drinkard)—&amp; 
      yet I value what <em>he</em> says &amp; does for me—He is inclined to think the seat of all my woe has been (what
      no one ever whispered before,) the <em>liver</em>, 
      acted upon largely also, perhaps almost primarily, thro[ugh] the emotional nature—at
      any rate he is decided 
      that the present botherations are absolutely <em>liver</em> troubles, &amp; their radiations—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Charley, I have had a sick, sick three weeks since you were here—havn't been out, except just 
      in front of the house in the sun, &amp; only three times that—but don't be alarmed, my
      dear friend—the probabilities are, (in my opinion any how,) that I shall get partially
      well yet—
   </p>
