   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="nyp.00720_n2">2. On  O'Connor wrote: "I have felt that you
      and I were brothers in misfortune." He also praised the 20 proof pages of "Sands
      at Seventy" that Whitman sent on .
      However, he did not appreciate the inclusion of "The Dead Emperor": "[I] find
      some consolation in the sweet assurance that he is finally damned, and can
      trouble earth no more!" Also on  O'Connor
      mentioned the hostile reception of Ignatius Donnelly's "book" in England
      (probably <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in the
         So-Called Shakespeare Plays</em> [1888]).<a href="#r2">[back]
