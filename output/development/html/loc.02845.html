      This letter's envelope bears the address, "Mrs Louise Chandler Moulton | care
      Philip Bourke Marston | 20 Ladbroke Grove Road | Notting Hill W | London |
      England." It is postmarked: "Camden | Dec | 11 | N.J.; London | F Z | Paid |

      Louise Chandler Moulton (1835–1908), an American poet, was staying with
      Philip Bourke Marston (to whom Whitman wrote on ), whose works she edited after his premature
      death in 1887. See Lilian Whiting, <em>Louise Chandler
         Moulton, Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Little, Brown, and Co., 1910). An
      entry in Whitman's Commonplace Book confirms the date (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
