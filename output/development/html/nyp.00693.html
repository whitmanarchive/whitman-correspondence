   <p>Nothing very new with me. Storms, snow &amp; cold weather. I send the <em>Harvard Monthly</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00693_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
      when thro' send to Dr Bucke.<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r3">3</a></sup> I am pottering along—certainly no worse in my late physical
      ailments—rather better possibly—the wind is sighing &amp; singing &amp; piping around the
      house as I write.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00693_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd Jan. 27/88." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service |
      Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | Jan (?) | 6 PM | 88;
      Washington, Rec'd | Jan | 19 | 7 AM | 1888 | 4.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00693_n2">2. The January issue of the
      <em>Harvard Monthly</em> included Charles T. Sempers' article
      "Walt Whitman and His Philosophy" (149–165). On , Sempers invited Walt Whitman to address the Harvard
      Signet Society. On the following day, in a personal communication, he informed
      the poet that "Prof. Wm James would like you to be his guest," and that he was
      making a study of Walt Whitman's poetry under an unnamed English
      instructor.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
