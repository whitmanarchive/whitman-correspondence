    "text": "[London, Ont.,]1 April [188]9Your card of 29th ult. just to hand. You will have lots of reading now with your 7 vols. of Stedman's \"Am. Lit.\" I wish you a good appetite for it! No doubt however it will be well worth looking through. Want much to see what he says of you in it.We have had a big fall of snow here (best part of a foot) snowed more than 24 hours, got through last night, now sun out again and snow going off rapidly.Nothing new with us, Inspector to be here this week. I enclose a list of a few misprints in \"Backward Glance\" which I found as I went over the piece again last eveningLove to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 1 April 1889"
