    "text": "Oct 11 p mDearest friendI am spending a few days down at the old farm, \"White Horse\"—wandering most all day (well clad & shod, for it is cool weather here) about the banks, trees, grass &c. by the very secluded beautiful druidic creek—have just picked up a few leaves that seem'dseemed to offer themselves to send specially to you, which I enclose. I am feeling middling well, for me. Shall send you word—or rather shall send myself—soon as I come back to town—Meanwhile love to you all— Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Anne Gilchrist, 11 October [1876]"
