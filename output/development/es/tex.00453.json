I am still living here, not much different from formerly—in good spirits, & getting along, hearty & fat and red, but clumsy & debilitated more & more.I think of collecting together my prose & verse of the last five years, & printing a little Vol: under the title of \"November Boughs\"—also of bringing out a complete budget of all my writing in one book. I remember you with much love—Walt Whitmanwrite, when at leisure & give me the news over there—also your exact address— Walt Whitman to Edward Dowden, 26 August 1886"
