R.\" or even more if you have plenty of copies on hand—If you send the books in a box please take care that there are no nails projecting into it—one vol. of the last batch got a little scratched up this way—You had better leave the expressage to be paid here as before & I will charge it against future remittancesI am yours alwaysR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 6 February 1880"
