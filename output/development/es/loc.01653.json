    "text": "1875 or 6431 Stevens st. cor WestCamden N. J.1873Dec.December 26—Noon.Dear boy Pete,I have been looking for you the last two days & nights—but I have about given you up now. I have been kept in pretty close, as we have had real winter here, snow & bad weather, & bad walking—I have been quite alone, as my brother & sister went off to Delaware on Wednesday on a Christmas visit, to return to-morrow, Saturday—I am about the same—My strength still keeps quite encouraging—I think is better than any time yet—my walking no better, & still a good deal of distress in the head—but, as I said in my letter of Monday last, (did you get it Tuesday?)—I somehow feel a little more like myself than any time since I was taken down—your last letter was quite a treat—so much about Washington, & folks, one thing & another—As I write I sit here in the parlor—we have had an awful time from the fire going out in the heater, & making it up again—there is so much complicated machinery about one of these heaters with all the late improvements—give me my old stove & wood fire yet—It is snowing by fits here this morning. Walt Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 26 December [1873]"
