    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,12 April 1889Not a word yet from Willy Gurd. I expect he is working day & night almost to get his gas meter made as soon as may be. A lull generally here, no letters and no excitement of any kind, having a quiet time and getting a rest except that there is quite a bit of daily asylum work to attend to. By & by when the gas meter is done I suppose there will be excitement enough to make up for this quiet. I am still reading Brockden Brown's novels, he has the funniest stilted stile I ever read—mechanical—as if his sentences were made by a strawcutter—ground out of the machine. We are having a delightful warm, quiet rain—the grass has become green in the last two days. I smell the summer coming! Hurrah!Love to you alwaysR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 12 April 1889"
