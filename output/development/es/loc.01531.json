    "text": "BrooklynSeptember 9, 1870Dear son,I wrote you a letter last Tuesday, 6th, which I suppose you have rec'd. The last I have from you was yours of Sunday, 4th. I am still here in Brooklyn, quite busy with the printing. I have rec'd a letter from John Rowland who is working for me in the office, complaining that he has to work too hard—I should think by his letter he means to back out of his bargain with me—if so, it will be a bad loss & inconvenience to me—But I shall not fret about it—whatever happens. It is likely that this will shorten my leave, & that I shall have to come back & do my work myself, about the end of the month. Dear Pete, I hope you are having good times, & are in good spirits. We are having quite coolish weather here. The drivers wear their overcoats mornings & evenings. As I sit here writing Friday afternoon, it is cloudy & threatens rain. I am going over to New York in an hour or so, & shall leave this in the P. O., and then go around awhile—possibly going to Niblo's Theatre, as they play Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\" to-night, with Davenport & quite a bunch of stars in the piece—Son, I am afraid I shall not make out much of a letter this time—but you take it so hard when I don't write, I thought I would send a few lines—they would be better than nothing—God bless you, my loving boy—& farewell for this time. Walt. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 9 September 1870"
