I will help you & suggest or criticise freely & candidly, leaving the decision to you of course—hope you understand this, as it is.Very hot weather here—I am quite comfortable, though—Have you rec'd Dr Knortz's German lecture?—Burroughs is home from his Kentucky trip—Dr Bucke will be back from England next week—Love to youWalt Whitman Walt Whitman to William Sloane Kennedy, 8 July 1886"
