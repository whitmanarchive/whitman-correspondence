    "text": "328 Mickle StreetCamden NJ US AmericaJan: 11 '89Dear Edw'd Carpenter,Y'rs came yesterday with the draft $174.37—best & heart-felt thanks—it will help me deeply—You speak of the original draft sent me in May last—no such draft has been rec'd or seen or heard of by me, & must have been either lost or miscarried or something else—So I shall use this at once—I am still cribb'd up in the sick room, now over seven months, but easier & freer of late—as I believe I told you in a letter three weeks ago—am very weak & unable to get across the room without assistance—but have a good strong nurse—& good medical supervision—sit up most of the days.I am wanting to envelope up & send some copies by Oceanic Express of my \"Complete Works,\" a big 900 page Vol. (one copy for you), all directed to my friend R. Pearsall Smith, 44 Grosvenor Road, the Embankment, London—will send you word when I do so—also wish you to give me address of Misses Ford (give them my love) to whom I send a copy in same package—As I finish I am comfortable—sitting in my big chair here by the oak fire—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Edward Carpenter, 11 January 1889"
