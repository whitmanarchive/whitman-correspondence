    "text": "Monday morningDear Walt,I had proposed to be over yesterday, but the rain set in, & minus an umbrella. I concluded to stay home & paint. I have the President about finished off. Hope to cast him, for good or ill, Wednesday, & get him on exhibition.I have painted 2 heads of yourself, & will bring them over. Have not been very well, so have had to keep quiet & stay in doorsindoors, in order to put in some time at work. I think the president looks well. I wish if it is a pleasant day tomorrow, you would get up courage ride over & make a call, & see for yourself how the \"head (& body) of the Nation looks.\"The boxes were shipped Monday, & I suppose you may have heard from Dr Bucke.Tell Mrs. Davis to look after the \"hens & things\" in the back yard & I will be greatly obliged. I sent Smith with your bust, an Emerson & two of the medallions.I hope you are as well as usual.If Herbert comes in today or tomorrow, ask him if wontwon't come & see me at 136 N. 17. This rain will settle things for the big Centennialâ€”Sincerely,S. H. Morse.Morse's Cellar Sidney H. Morse to Walt Whitman, 26 December 1887"
