    "text": "BurlingtonApril 24,1890—Bro Walt.A bright sky, but a very cold day—ice remains firm on the shade side of the street. I have been striving to raise enough to buy ½ tin of coal—quite exhausted—more so than at any time this season.Han is despondent, weak, very nervous; you must expect her to reply, even by postal to your kind notes—The paper you maild[mailed] to her was very encouraging, and she craves for a couple of rooms near you—that she might furnish, and enjoy with you the bright Camden sunshine—I am quite broken down at times; irritable from this epidemic—I make two coal fires and have the sitting room and kichen[kitchen] well warmed, when she comes down, but a man is not precisely the kind of servant a woman needs. Mrs. Church is very clever but she has a house full of boarders. She is very thorough and competent.I am puzzled at times how to continue—I sleep well—yet I need rest other ways. I feel at times that I shall be compelled to give up—I have something like the eumonia[pneumonia] at times too, in my left chest. I have no physician.Charlie Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 24 April 1890"
