    "text": "To Walt Whitman. Poet..My very dear SirIf you will reply to this I shall be satisfied; and where one is so easily made happy—will you grudge a little inconvenience?I should be very proud of your autograph, and because I know it to be a healthful pleasure I anticipate my hearo[hero]-worship is pardonable.You are well known here and much talked of—and we are looking for a fresh edition of your poems. How long must we wait?I am approaching my twenty-fourth birthday—and stand upon the order of printing a small selection of my own rhymes—being assisted in this (perhaps unwise move) by my friends. May I send you a copy of my book in June?—when it will be safely out. D. V.Please answer me—if possible, and be sure—if you so far honor me—I shall thank your indulgence, rather than mistrust that my verses have afforded you any pleasure.I am, dear Sir—Yours faithfullyChas. W. Stoddard..San Francisco—Cal.8th Feb—1867.MY FRIENDI have a friend who is so true to me,We may not parted be.Though I strayed, on to the uttermost,Yet is his voice not lost.If I am madly-deaf for having erred,Still may I hear his word.If sin hath slain mine honor, straight appears,The river of his tears,Wherein I find redemption: tenderlyHe woos my fear away,And searches out some star of hope, above,So boundless in his love.When from the loathed grave I shall arise,He'll hail me from the skies.Who else would seek me in corruption's dressWith a so kind caress?Though I am weak, there is a hope of power;He is my mighty tower;Like as a flame to fright the gloom away;He is my perfect day.I am the homely bulb that tops the reed—He is the precious seed.I am the rudest shell the vext-waves whirl—He is the priceless pearl.Thou art indeed my friend while ages roll,O! thou my deathless soul.C. W. S.AT ANCHOR.A sailor by the green home-shore,While seas are ebbing from his view,Doth all his earthly joys renew:He sings the songs he sang of yore;He spies his little cot, he smilesWith a full joy ne'er felt before—He holds that one bare prospect moreThan all the summer of the isles.The quiet home is his; the treesSprang from the seeds his grandsires laid,Among the mould; within the gladeThe myrtles rustle in the breeze.Above a treasured little grave,His earthly lost, his first deep woe!Not any land that he may knowBeyond the purple of the waveHath such a jewel in its breast.He loves each rock and stream and dell;'Tis only here he cares to dwell,'Tis ever here he longs to rest.This is his home of joy and ease:And better is the myrtle tombThan all the heavy dusks that gloomThe groves of spice beyond the seas.C. W. S.AT THE SPRING.I knew a cumbrous hill,From whose green breast did daintily distillA throbbing rill.This is the artery,And further on the crystal heart must be,Thought said to me.All other I forsook,To follow every twist and curious crookOf this wild brook.Among deep mosses set,I found the glimmering fount that did begetThe rivulet.No other eye had knownIts secret, nor ear heard—for it made moanAlways alone.I quaffed its water clear;Its limpid music babbled to mine earWith voice sincere.Then such a silence fellUpon me, mantling me, as where a spellIs wont to dwell.Yet fled I from the placeAt a rude rustling; and fear gave me chaseIn my disgrace.'Twas a slim water-snakeSlipt like an arrow through the shivering brake.And left no wake.But cleft the placid springAnd waved its flaming sword, its forked sting,In a charmed ring.   *   *   *   *   *   *   *So was the fountain spoiledWithin its lucid walls a devil coiled—My trust was foiled.Chas. Warren Stoddard.San Francisco, Cal.THE SECRET WELLI know a well so deep and coolAnd hid, the crystal-hearted poolHath never thrilled a swallow's throatOr sweetened a lark's note.No fainting stag, though perishing,Hath ventured to disturb this spring;No leopard with its fiery breastThis fountain dares molest.No cunning silver-cased troutThe sheltered source can e'er search out—No tongue but mine may ever tellThe secret of this well.I build about its guarded rimWith added stones: I know the dimStill twilight of its mossy cell,Where the sweet waters dwell.For spirits go between us twoWith flasks; they brim with softest dew.I drink and am refreshed and seemAs living in a dream.This well, that is alone for me,Is all a fount of memory;And every year that I have knownIs as an added stone.My willing thoughts, as spirits, hasteTo draw the draught I love to taste.There is an ever full supplyYet who may drink but I?C. W. S.A RHYME OF LIFE.If life be as a flame that death doth kill:Burn little candle lit for me.With a pure spark, that I may rightly seeTo word my song and utterlyGod's plan fulfill.If life be as a flower that blooms and dies:Forbid the cunning frost that slaysWith Judas-kiss, and trusting love betrays:Forever may my song of praiseUntainted riseIf life be as a voyage, or foul, or fair:Oh! bid me not my banners furlFor adverse gale, or wave in angry whirl,Till I have found the gates of pearlAnd anchored there.C. W. S.Cherries and Grapes.Not the cherries' nerveless flesh,However fair, however fresh,May ever hope my love to winFor Ethiope blood and satin skin.Their lustre rich, and deep their dye,Yet under all their splendors lie—To what I cannot tribute grant—Their hateful hearts of adamant.I love the amber globes that holdThat dead-delicious wine of gold;A thousand torrid suns distillSuch liquors as those flagons fill.Yet tropic gales with souls of muskShould steep my grapes in steams of dusk;An orient Eden nothing lacksTo spice their purple silken sacks.C. W. S.MADRIGAL.A maid is sitting by a brook,The sweetest of sweet creatures:I pass that way with my good bookYet cannot read, nor cease to lookUpon her winsome features.Amongst the blushes on her cheekHer small, white hand reposes:I am a shepherd, for I seekThat wilful lamb, with fleece so sleek,Feeding among the roses!C. W. S. Charles Warren Stoddard to Walt Whitman, 8 February 1867"
