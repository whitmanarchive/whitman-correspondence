    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,28 Nov 1888EveningThank you very much for \"Critic\" and \"American\" received today. I quite agree with you (in the \"Critic\") that America has produced several poets (among those who are dead) equal to several of the thirteen. All quiet here—a long letter from William Gurd today—all going well with him and the meter but it goes slow, slow—looks as if there would never be an end of it—We are having here warm, dull, muggy weather. All quiet here (not to say dull)I sent \"the second head\" the other day to an Art Loan in London—and felt quite dull without it—have got it back again—it is looking cheerfully at me now from its bracket in the corner of my officeAffectionatelyR M Buckesee notes Dec 1st 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 28 November 1888"
