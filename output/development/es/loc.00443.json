Hope you wont be disappointed in the smallness of the amount—but Davis had to go away and did'nt[didn't] have time to see if he could collect any at his office.Mother Mat and the children are all quite well—but have rather a hard time to keep warm—wish when you write Mother you would always say something abtabout Hattie's learning to read and play &c  it sets her ahead wonderfully—you know how such things please children—should like to have you write me that long letter—I hope also to be able to pay you a short visit this winter—soon after the Holidays—everything is going abtabout as usual with us at homeaffectionately yours Jeff Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 21 December 1866"
