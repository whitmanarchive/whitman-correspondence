    "text": "PastackSept.September 1st 1877Mr WhitmanMy dear friendYour letter of May from Kirkwood was duly recdreceived but as I dislike writing letters, & have been pretty busy I hope you will pardon my delay.I believe I told you in my last letter of my intention to become, if possible, an engineer,My intention still holds good, but despite all my efforts, I have failed to obtain a situationI suppose the trouble lies in my not being acquainted with men of that class, so for the present I will have to take things as they come.I was in N.Y.New York the first of the week & saw Uncle Geo.â€”he is working off & on, for Uncle John, & the Ryers.I hope you will still be able to mak[make] that long expected visit.If you are able to come this fall I will meet you, in N.Y.New York at any timeWe are all well, & things go on about as usual, with the exception that times seem to get worse & worse.Your loving friend,Walt Walt Whitman Storms to Walt Whitman, 1 September 1877"
