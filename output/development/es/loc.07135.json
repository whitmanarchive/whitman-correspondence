    "text": "Insane AsylumLondon Ontario22 Dec 1890The best letter I have had for a long time was one this moment received written by Dr. Mitchell jr. to Horace and forwarded me by the latter. This letter gives an acct of the analysis of your water and according to it your kidneys are absolutely sound. There is nothing at all wrong with your water works except the enlarged prostate and the irritation consequent upon it. Your main difficulty is that on account of the enlargement of the prostate the bladder is not entirely emptied at any time—the urine retained undergoes decomposition and causes irritation—now what is wanted is that a catheter should be passed morning and evening and all the water drawnoff (in this way) twice a day. This would have to be done by a doctor for a time but there is no reason whatever that Warran[Warren] should not learn to do it as well as any doctor after being instructed and provided with a proper catheter. I shall hope to hear that this matter is put upon a proper footing at once and after this is done I have every confidence that I shall hear of your being more comfortable than for a long time back.All well here—glorious weather—but alas! our snow is gone and we have to use wheels again.All quiet with the meter—too quiet! We do not get on nearly as fast as I should like but if we go slow I have confidance[confidence] that we are going sure and now that I am relieved about your kidneys I have good hopes you will be with us to have the \"good time coming\"RM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 22 December 1890"
