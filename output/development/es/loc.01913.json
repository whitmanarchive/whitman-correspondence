    "text": "Copenhagen28th of december of 74. Dear Walt Whitman.Before the old year is closing I will send you a few lines only to express the hope, that you may enter into the new year in an ameliorated state of health mind and body! Your answer to my letter from Garsdal I duely received. A forthnight[fortnight] after the receipt of it I sent you a number of Danish Kolkets dent (Danish people's paper) with a criticism of your book by Mr Termansen—a very bad one.The author is a peasant, member of one Danish house of the Commons, originally a gifted man, but at present one of the spoiled dalsegs of the haut ton Copenhagen society. Even into the greatest assemblies he appears in the coarse Luffs of the Danish peasants' home dress;—vanity! He is one of what Bjornion with a very happy expression calls them pale-born peasants.If you have had the criticisms especially Elate's , completely translated for you I should like to know what impression all these foreign judgments may have made on you. The least benevolent of them are, you will allow, far more benevolent than your homely American criticism. But you have many friends, male and female, here, who don't write criticisms.I have been accostumed[accustomed] to receive papers and small parcels from you and have always been glad for it, even when I forgot to share you. In the last five months I have received nothing. Earnestly hoping that the reason may not be, that your illness has increasedI am yoursRudolf Schmidt Rudolf Schmidt to Walt Whitman, 28 December 1874"
