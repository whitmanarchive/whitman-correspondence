    "text": "BostonJune 5/60.Dear Walt.—We sent you yesterday copy of Banner of Light cent'y critique on Leaves Grass written by Gen. Canning Hill,—He appreciates the Poems & you too. Be assured he speaks truthfully and just as he believes & feels.—By the bye, will you please write for our consideration terms of contract for publishing L of G.? We have been expecting said document, and now wish to have it adjusted as early as possible if agreeable to yourself. Inasmuch as our \"writing\" has been submitted to you, your \"writing\" submitted to us will accommodate us if sent early.—We have so many things to think of that we would like to dispose of this contract & \"go on our way rejoicing\".—Regards to Mr. Clapp—& for yourself the \"fraternals\" of Thayer & Eldridge. I think that Mrs. Beachs'sBeach's criticism is just about the damndest piece of scolding ever written by a woman who does not know what she is talking about. My wife was indignant, and I should not wonder if she wrote a reply to it.W. W. ThayerThayer & Eldridge | June 11 1860 William Wilde Thayer to Walt Whitman, 5 June 1860"
