I went directly to my frame makers, the frame will be done to-morrow, (it is a beauty) and if you wish I will send it in a few days. It is my wish it should be seen in Boston. Let me know how you propose to introduce it. It must be hung where the Fellows will see it,—you know what I mean. Let the light be an important thing, and dont[don't] allow any clap-trap surroundings. Let it be the thing wherever it is, at any price. I had intended as you are aware to put it in the Academy.— Tell me what you think. If I put it there I must enter it by the 31st—What shall I do? I wish to please you and feeling that you understand me I wait your pleasure. Write immediately for we have no time to looseMost truly yoursChas HineArtist Charles Hine to Walt Whitman, 21 March 1860"
