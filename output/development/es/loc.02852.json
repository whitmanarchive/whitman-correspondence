I have been waiting for the chance to get from the bindery, or from my stack, (as I unwrap the books) a copy of Two Rivulets with the dark brown label you want—I have it in mind, & shall get it so, & send it you— Meantime, let this remorseful note be my apology——My address here is still the same—Walt WhitmanCamden New Jersey Walt Whitman to William J.
