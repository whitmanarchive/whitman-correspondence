    "text": "431 Stevens street | Camden New JerseyJan 24 '77I think Birds and Poets not only much the best name for the book, but a first-rate good name, appropriate, original & fresh, without being at all affected or strained. The piece you put 4thforth should then be first—should lead the book, giving it its title, & having the name of the piece changed to \"Birds and Poets\"—which I think would be an improvement. The whole collection would be sufficiently homogeneous, (and it were a fault to be too much so)—You just want a hint for the name of a book—Only it must be in the spirit of the book—& not too much so either. \"Nature and Genius\" is too Emersony altogether. I will think over the name of the piece devoted to me, & will in a couple of days write you the result. May-bemaybe I can think of a better name. I have not rec'd the MS from Church. You send on any thing—any MS—which I will cheerfully read & will return with any suggestions that may occur to me—I keep pretty well for me—W W Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 24 January 1877"
