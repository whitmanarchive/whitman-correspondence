    "text": "Camden N JFeb: 21 '83—p. m.Have just been looking over the \"Transfer\" pamphlet you sent—pages 46, '7, to which you call'd my attention are (I allow myself to think) a latent flattering unction to me & the ways I suggest of looking at questions in America. Indeed such things do me more good than you think for—I am just going over to Germantown to spend to-night, to-morrow & till Thursday noon in the big family & big house, wife, son, two splendid daughters of a Quaker friend, whose carriage comes for me presently. The eldest daughter, age 20, an admirer of L. of G. who comes up even to you. Thanks for the MS.—(as I write, has not yet arrived but will be here soon no doubt)—You shall see the proof—all your wishes shall be followed.I am curious to see the Carlyle-Emerson letters—(had not heard before about my being in them)—You hit long ago on the reason-why of the Emerson (apparent) change, or defection or cloud—whatever it is to be call'd—it was the interference, doubtless hard lying, of others—there was & is a little knot of my most malignant enemies, deadly haters, in & around Boston—some in high quarters—& they plied the man incessantly—Then above all that appears or he appears to say—you may be sure that E loved me—I believe more than he did any one—he showed it at first, & stronger still at last—that Saturday evn'g & Sunday afternoon he & I were (mostly silently) together in September, 1881, at Concord, told it—told better than ever can be put in words— Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 21 February 1883"
