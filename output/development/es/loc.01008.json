    "text": "Friend Walter: I did not answer your last letter because I could not reply to the questions it put. I have heard since that Emerson tried to have something done about you, but failed. Believing that he would write to you, I didn't.There is a prejudice agstagainst you here among the \"fine\" ladies & gentlemen of the transcendental School. It is believed that you are not ashamed of your reproductive organs, and, somehow, it wdwould seem to be the result of their logicâ€”that eunuchs only are fit for nurses. If you are ready to qualify yourself for their sympathy & support, that you may not unnecessarily suffer therefrom, is the sincere wish of your friend,James RedpathDid you see the paragraph I wrote in The Commomwealth about you ? If not, I'll send another copy. James Redpath to Walt Whitman, 5 May 1863"
