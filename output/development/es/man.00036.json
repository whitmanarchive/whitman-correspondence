    "text": "25 Chesham StreetLondon S. W.3 July 1880My dear FriendI write you one line to ask you if you can do me a little favourfavor. I possess Walter Scott's poem of \"Harold the Dauntless,\" in Walter Scott's own hand writing, & one or two leaves of the precious MSmanuscript are unfortunately lost. A few of my friends, who are poets, have been pleased to do honour to themselves & to Scott, & they have Copied in the missing lines of the poem. Would you kindly write in one stanza of nine lines. I have marked the exact place where they are to come. A Tennyson, Longfellow, Emerson, Whittier, Holmes, Browning, & a few others, English & American Poets, have already written in their share, & the book is nearly complete. I wish I could send you the Volume, but I hardly dare trust it by post. So I send a leaf which when you, & three or four others, have written in the Contents, will be added to the Scott. MSmanuscript.Pardon me for troubling you on this rather absurd subject, & for asking you for this favourTennyson has been at Venice. & is now in Paris. I expect him in London early next week.Believe me Affectionate Your Friend,F Locker Frederick Locker-Lampson to Walt Whitman, 3 July 1880"
