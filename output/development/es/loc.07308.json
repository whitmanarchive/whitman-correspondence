    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,5 June 1889Your card of 2d came to hand last ev'g and this morn'g I received the two packets of papers. Thanks for them. Long letter from Willy Gurd last ev'g all going well with the meter but I guess will take a while yet to get it fairly started. The Dinner must have been a complete success as far as I can judge from papers &c. But the big success of 31st is the little L. of G. I am more and more delighted with it. I enclose a letter from a friend of mine here which will explain itself guess he will become \"one of the elect\" after awhile.\" Still raining! beats all. All well hereLove to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 5 June 1889"
