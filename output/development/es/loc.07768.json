    "text": "CamdenFriday Evn'gJune 15 '88Rather warm weather—moist and sweaty, suits me—I am sitting up in the big chair this afternoon—looking languidly at the proof & copy for the printers—they & the boss are kind & indulgent to me—so far I like them & the work—had a bowel motion this morning (took a calomel powder last night)—I eat my meals every time, one at a time (rather moderately) so far yesterday—have eaten stew'd chicken—oatmeal gruel—strawberries—&c. I had two moderate roast apples for my supper Mrs. Harned sent me—Oesler was here every day—is faithful—was here two hours ago—Baker is here & devoted—is very cautious (I wanted to take a calomel powder last night, but he was not willing to do it till he had your or Oesler's authority first)—Hadn't I better take these powders ab't twice a month, following them with the bitter water—in the chronic condition I seem to be in they seem to bring better result than any thing else—Pete Doyle was over this evening—I was real glad to see him—he only staid two minutes—Horace Traubel has been—the printers move on quite lively—I have had a pretty good hour feeling on the 9 hour turning to night—If I can get over the great debility & the bad feeling (jellity & soreness & half pain) in my head, spells frequent, then I shall feel I am getting on ahead—Saturday June 16—2½ P MIt is certain I hold the main in mend & eat moderately & have another bowel movement to day—but I keep very weak—head is uncomfortable—To day is hot & stuffy, but I don't mind—Walt WhitmanMaurice, send this to Wm O'C[onnor] and Nelly—to be return'd to you ag'n— Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 15–16 June 1888"
