    "text": "Los Angeles, Cal.—Sept 6, 1887Dear Walt:—Your postal just received, Glad you comentcomment that Grace shall go on with the Calendar.—They have not yet returned from their summer trip to Alaska.—Expect them about the 15th & shall see them soon after they arrive— I have not heard from William direct since he want to Bar Harbor, but have a letter from Nelly this morning in which she says that the new farm is very favorable.—Dr Kinnear says he is improving and William himself, who is not at all disposed to be sanguine on that point, also says the same.—He says that he wishes he had been fortunate enough to fall into Dr Kinnear's hands at first.—This is very good news, and I know it will be very joyful tidings to you and all of William's friends—The summer months are now over, and I can truly say that Los Angeles has the most perfect summer climate I have ever experienced—If this is a specimen—no one would ever want to go away from here to escape the heat, rather stay to enjoy the ideal summer weather. Imagine a place where in the shade you are always comfortable—delicious sea breezes, in which you can smell the salt air, blow every afternoon (the ocean is only 18 miles away) and the superb nights with their glorious pageantry of stars give you the most refreshing sleep—always under a blanket—I think that when this climate is truly known, as many people will come here from the East in the summer time to escape the torrid heat, as will come in the winter to avoid the Arctic cold. The markets here are now gorged with the most magnificent display of fruit you ever saw. The most attractive are perhaps the peaches, the plums and the grapes which excel any thing I have heretofore known both in size, beauty and lusciousness. The muscats (principal grape for raisins) the Malagas, (also for raisins) both white. Then there are the Saint Peters, the Tokays and the Mission grape (used principally for wine)—the latter all purple—You can buy them at the fruit stands for 2 cents a pound—some times 6 lb for 10 cents.—Some of the clusters weigh three pounds and more. They are a sight delightful to the eye.—There are also plenty of figs in market.—But I do not take much to them in their natural state. This is also the country of the olive, the pomegranate and the Almond. Large quantities of English walnuts are also raised. In the winter or early Spring the oranges and lemons are gathered.—So you see this will be eventually the great fruit raising part of the U.S. No ports, no thunderstorms, no cyclones— But I have given you enough of Southern California for one time.—Always delighted to hear from you.—Send me a postal card when you can, and a letter when you have leisure & feel like writing to your old comrade who is as ever.— Faithfully Yours,Charles W. Eldridge Charles W. Eldridge to Walt Whitman, 6 September 1887"
