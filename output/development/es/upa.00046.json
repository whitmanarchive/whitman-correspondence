    "text": "Niagara Falls, AmericaSeptember 28 '80My dear friendI must write you a line or two—but it will be a short letter—I am on my way back to Camden, stopping here only temporarily. Have had a very successful summer trip—have jaunted over 3000 miles, no mishaps, and generally everything working in well—have met with many friends, & kindness & good will everywhere—I am as well as usual again the last two months, indeed I think I am better than usual—the climate country &c agree with me & I almost hate to leave them. Dr and Mrs Bucke have been like brother & sister, unvaryingly kind & helpful & affectionate—(Dr has several times spoken of you)—I rec'dreceived your letter of a month since—My brother & sister are well, & matters as usual with them—Dr B wishes to be remembered—he has come on to the Falls with me. Peter Doyle has also come on from Washington, to spend a short time here & then return with me to Philadelphia. Love to you dear friend, & to Beatrice, Herbert & Grace—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Anne Gilchrist, 28 September 1880"
