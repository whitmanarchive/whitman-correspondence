    "text": "You ought to stay over till Monday, or Tuesday.Concord, Mass.April 11/81.My Dear Whitman,On receipt of your card, to-day, stating the time of your intended start, I telegraphed so as to be sure to reach you with word in time. I now give you the details. O'Reilly has arranged matters at the Revere House, & you are to be a guest there during your stay. As I am not now in Boston, but out here (20 miles away), I cannot be at the station to meet you, & must therefore ask you to go right to the Revere, where you will be well taken care of. I will come & see you Friday forenoon; not expecting to be in town before then. Etherige I have written to but have been too busy to see (having been away in N.Y.), & he will doubtless come to see you punctually.Mrs. John T. Sargent (at whose house the Radical or Chestnut Street Club meets) has, I learn, issued cards for an informal reception to you on Friday at 3 P.M. This you would best go to, unless it will annoy you or in any way interfere with your comfort in lecturing that evening; & bear in mind that we expect you around at the St. Botolph after the lecture, & nothing must be done which will tire you too much for that.We have sold a fine lot of tickets.Au revoir on Friday.Faithfully yoursGP Lathrop.April '81 Letter from Lathrop ab't the Boston lecture George Parsons Lathrop to Walt Whitman, 11 April 1881"
