    "text": "1874 or 5431 Stevens st. cor West.Camden, N. Jersey,74?Feb.February 13, 2½ p.m.Dear Pete,Here I am yet, in my big chair in the parlor—I am up & around, but not very well—I am having a return, (though not so severe,) of those old blurs that used to trouble me—have had a succession of them all day to day so far—begun yesterday—but I have no doubt they will pass over. It is cloudy & sulky here to-day, partially thawing—& is raining now—I have been out, managed to walk round the block, but had to return—did not feel well. Pete there is nothing new—I got your last letter—have rec'd letters from Mrs. O'Connor—I have no doubt I shall feel better—my sickness comes & goes—& my relief spells the same—I shall probably have to stay in the rest of the day & evening—which is very dull & stupid for me—in fact quite dismal—But I must not write what will make you blue—would rather cheer you up—I am still continuing the pieces in the Weekly Graphic—(will be ended with one or two more)—expect to have a piece in next Harper, (March) but am not certain—Just as I close, the carrier has tapped at the window—he brings me a letter from Boston, & in it a check paying a debt due me a long time, & which I had quite given up—which puts me in better spirits—good bye for present, my dear loving son—Your Walt Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 13 February [1874]"
