    "text": "See notes June 20 & July 1 1888Richmond, Ind.June 15/88.Dear W—I sent word to Horace one day that I had an intuition that you were about to enter upon a new lease of life. The next day the telegraph announced you were slightly improved from a severe attack of \"heart failure.\" Now Horace writes you are quite yourself again. I take it my spirit-sense of your condition is not likely to fail after all. But the hot weather is coming, & we shall get it by July good & hot. I hope I can get into comfortable shape by the time it reaches Camden.Am glad Horace is at hand to afford any help you might need.I have about concluded not to go to the Cin. Exposition. There is so much red tape it will cost me all of $20 to exhibit a few busts. I am calculating on starting for Chicago middle of next week. I'd like to look in on the Chicago Convention—just to see the shape of the heads that are prominent.I notice a marked difference in the political atmosphere here & in Mass. People here are more rambunkious; they get mad. The republicans are high toned & look down on democrats. If you show any proclivities of democratic color they wonder how you can. How can white think well of black? And then, the anti-copperhead talk is still rampant here. The dems are sore some over the slaughter of Gray, & Harrison would catch many sore head votes. If the Republicans have got to have a rushing campaign, they'll get it sooner with the freedom of old Tipicanu (?)Tippicanoe than with the cold blooded Sherman. But I believe Blain would sweep the States. Every body fairly dances when his name is mentioned. Strange. I can't understand it. Somehow I am drawn personally more to Cleveland than any one of the others. And yet, he's a kind of a pork.Well, this is a hot day here. I hope you keep mending, & that you only went back a little for a new start.Kindly,Morse. Sidney H. Morse to Walt Whitman, 15 June 1888"
