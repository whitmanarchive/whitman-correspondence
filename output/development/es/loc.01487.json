    "text": "Washington D. C.Aug 22, 1871. Draft letter. Dear Mr. Dowden, Dowden (1843–1913), professor of English literature at the University of Dublin, sent a copy of his article with a letter on July 23, 1871: \"I ought to say that the article expresses very partially the impression which your writings have made on me. It keeps, as is obvious, at a single point of view, & regards only what becomes visible from that point. But also I wrote more cooly than I feel because I wanted those, who being ignorant of your writings are perhaps prejudiced against them, to say 'Here is a cool, judicious, impartial critic who finds a great deal in Whitman— perhaps, after all, we are mistaken'\" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, ed., With Walt Whitman in Camden (1906–1964), 5 vols., 1:134). Note also Dowden's comments to Burroughs, in Clara Barrus, Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades (1931), 67. On three occasions in 1870 Dowden had written to Rossetti about his difficulties in having his article published; see Rossetti Papers, 517–518, 519, 520. In 1888 Walt Whitman observed to Traubel: \"Dowden is a book-man: but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect\" (I, 299). I have received your kind letter, & your review in the Westminster, & thank you heartily. I wish to write you at more length, & may do so before long. I take real comfort in the thought that I have such friends in Ireland, including yourself. I wish to hear more of Mr. Tyrrell, R. Y. Tyrrell, a fellow of Trinity College and \"an excellent Greek scholar,\" had recently delivered a public lecture on Walt Whitman's poetry; see Horace Traubel, ed., With Walt Whitman in Camden (1906–1964), 5 vols., 1:135, 225. whom you speak of. Walt Whitman Letter from Walt Whitman to Edward Dowden, 22 August 1871"
