    "text": "West Park N.Y.March 28, 1889Dear Walt:A paper from you last night reminds me that it is time I again reported myself. We are back home again & I am busy about my farm work. The spring is early, the robins are calling the old call about the place, the sparrows are singing the old songs, & nature seems as fresh & young as ever. My plough seems to find as much fat in the ribs of old mother Earth as ever it did & it looks just as sweet. I am very glad to be back again, & to get at some real work. On the 5th of March I went to NY. for a week; stayed with Gilder & then with Johnson; had a pretty good time. Saw some of the small literary fry, dined with Gilder at the Fellowcraft Club of which he is president, met George Kennan of whom I think highly, met Mrs Custer & Mrs Cleveland both charming women. Charles DeKay is married & is stout & handsome. Gilder is very busy, goes out a good deal, but finds time to write some poetry still. He owns a house now in Clinton Place (8th st.) Walked down to City hall & was astonished to see the Times building towering up & quite overshadowing the Tribune building. Its architecture is fine & makes the spotted & clumsy character of the building of its rival look cheap enough.I am to have a new book this Spring, a collection of \"Indoor Essays,\" rather a piece of book-making businessâ€”not much worth.I hope you are comfortable these spring days, & can nearly get a glimpse of the spring. I am well, but not very cheerful for some reason. Any news from O'Connor, or yourself will be very welcome.With the old loveJohn Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 28 March 1889"
