    "text": "BrooklynSunday afternoon, May 5th.Dear William O'Connor,When I arrived home yesterday I found my brother worse than I had anticipated. It is a case of malignant erysipelas, with great swelling, sores, & for a while complete blindness, now partially relieved. There are spells also of lethargy & flightiness—all bad enough, yet, as far as the case stands at this present writing, he will come out safe, I somehow feel certain.Mother is well as usual—defers every thing else, & does the nursing, &c. for George. When I came, yesterday, I found her standing with a cup of warm tea, feeding slowly with a spoon, to some one wrapt in a great blanket, & seated in an arm chair, by the stove—I did not recognize my brother at first—he was so disfigured, & the features out of all proportion & discolored. Mother put down the cup, &c. & began to cry—this affected poor George—yet I preserved my composure, though much distrest, as you will understand.The rest of the family are well. Jeff leaves to-morrow evening for St. Louis. It is cold here, with raw easterly wind. I met Henry Clapp in Broadway yesterday—he has a $1500 clerkship in a public office in New York—I met Edward H. House —also other of my young men friends—they are all very, very cordial & hospitable—I shall go over & make Mrs. Price a short visit this afternoon. They all talk of you here—as of the good person, the desired one, exhilarating, whose presence gives sun, & whose talk nourishes—(I think you must have laid yourself out that evening.) Dear Nelly, I send you my love—also to Charles Eldridge—shall probably remain here the ensuing week. Walt Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 5 May [1867]"
