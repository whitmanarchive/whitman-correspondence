I have not yet seen it but have read several of the poemsâ€”\"Lines on a Locomotive\" I cut out of a newspaper years ago before I knew your name thinking it very forcible & grand. Trusting that you still enjoy life & that as sometimes happens the paralysis is decreasing & that you are surrounded by kind friends; & surely you must be for are not you the friend of every man!I feel the confidence of me of those friends that you will find no presumption in my writing thus, & again thanking you for the assurance of that brotherly feelingBelieve meSincerely yoursEmma Riley Emma Riley to Walt Whitman, 23 November [1883]"
