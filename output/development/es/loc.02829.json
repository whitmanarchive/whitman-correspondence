    "text": "431 Stevens st CamdenApril 4Dear Dan:I take an interest in the boy in the office, Harry Stafford—I know his father & mother—There is a large family, very respectable American people—farmers, but only a hired farm—Mr. Stafford in weak health—I am anxious Harry should learn the printer's trade thoroughly—I want him to learn to set type as fast as possible—want you to give him a chance (less of the mere errands &c)—There is a good deal really in the boy, if he has a chance. Don't say any thing about this note to him—or in fact to any one—just tear it up, & keep the matter to yourself private. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to [Daniel Whittaker], 4 April [1876]"
