    "text": "41 Stevens St. cor WestCamden, J. JerseyDec. 30, '75. Forgive my not writing before. Much of the time, I cannot write, from paralysis. Very soon in 1876 I issue a small edition of my complete works in two volumes. Leaves of Grass will be one. The other, Two Rivulets, alternations of prose & verse—the themes ab'tabout as diverse as they can be—poetry, politics, the war, &c— (I kept a diary from 1862–'65, scenes in Virginia, Washington, &c. the hospital, camps, battles &c. here given almost verbatim.) I publish & shall sell the volumes myself, for two good reasons. No established publisher in the country will print my books, & during the last three years of my illness & helplessness every one of the three successive book agents I have had in N.Y. has embezzled the proceeds. To sum up the situation at present: My health & strength are probably irrecoverable—still I may endure some years yet—mind unaffected—spirits good—keep up about one third of the time, prostrated partially or wholly the other two thirds—pecuniary matters then & meagre, (but not in want)—shall probably reside steadily here in Camden. And now good bye, & happy New Year to you my friend. Though this letter itself is not intended for publication, you are at liberty to use any or all the statements in it should you have occasion under your own judgement. Walt Whitman One of the first of the proof copies sent out at all shall be to you. A great part of Two Rivulets, prose & poetry, is fresh matter, hitherto unpublished. Walt Whitman to Unknown Correspondent, 30 December 1875"
