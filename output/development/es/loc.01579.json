    "text": "Sent May 9—'68My dear Charles Hine,I received with gladness the authentic sign & proof that you are on hand & doing, viz. \"Watsons Art Journal\" with notice &c.—I am anxious to see the picture. I am sure it must be a thing of beauty, glowing, human, & true. Believe me, my friend, I have not forgotten you, nor your old kindness & friendliness. Also Mrs. Hine & the daughter—to whom I send best remembrances. As soon as I come to New York again, I will visit you at the studio. In the meantime, I send you by same mail as this a copy of my last edition, also a little book, written by Mr. Burroughs, (a second Thoreau,) and a newspaper, with letter—the book & letter all about my precious self—& I dare say may interest you. If the books are not brought by the carrier, you must send to p. o. for them. I have seen Faris here, but now he has gone back to N. Y. I am working in the Attorney General's office—have a pleasant berth, moderate pay, but sufficient—I am well, weight nearly 200, & eat my rations every time. You must write, & let me know whether the books come safe. Walt Whitman to Charles Hine, 9 May 1868"
