Was glad to have a call from Debbie & your neiceniece Lizzie—So Lizzie Hider and Wes are to be married soon—well if it is to come off at all the sooner the better & I hope it will turn out a happy marriage,—should say there was the best reason to expect it to, for both have estimable qualities & I dontdon't see how a woman can help loving the good man she lives with as a wife—Best love to Harry, I got his good letter & will answer it soon—love to George & allW WSend me a chicken when you have a chance Walt Whitman to Susan Stafford, 6 February [1881]"
