Kirkwood $1\"   John D Martin $1\"   Chas Botsford  and $3 from self.We are awfully pleased and excited at the war news. Feel as if the man had been appointed that was thinking less of political affairs than of licking the rebs. We are just getting news of the surrender of Vicksburgh. Hope to God that it is true. Bully for Meade! He has not only licked the rebs but the peace party headed by McClellan. Hope that he will not let them off but will poke it into them  How do you get along? I suppose you hardly have time to write me. I sent you a letter containing $15 last week  did you get it?Nothing new at home  I did not have any \"time\" on the 4th so I send you this money that I might have spent. do the little sums that we send you enable you to do any good.Dear brother I am in a tremendious[tremendous] hurry, and you must excuse my letter. Mother sent you a letter a day or two since. Mattie and the babies are first-rate. Mother quite well. rest all right. Will write you again in a few daysaffectionately Jeff Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 7 July 1863"
