    "text": "See notes Oct. 21, '89Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,18 Oct 1889I wrote a note this morning and this evening have received yours of 16th enclosing Fanny M. Grunde's quite affecting little letter and Mrs Spaulding's card. You ask me whether there is any thing I desire Ed. to bring me from Camden. I do not know that there is except the pictures wh I mentioned in mine of this morning. I mean the little collection of Photo's and engravings which you are about issuing. I suppose you do not want to send me that 1872 L. of G. ? And I do not want you to send it untill you are quite ready—but do not let somebody else carry it off! I suppose you never found that copy of Harrington? I have never been able to get a copy and it seems as if I never should get one. Yes, I think we may flatter ourselves that L. of G. has got a locus Standi at last. No one now (unless inspired by ignorance as well as stupidity) can hoot at the book as the uncu'guid thought well to do awhile ago. L. of G. has come to stay and must be seriously considered by all serious men henceforth whether they like it or whether they don't—what the outcome of the consideration will be (on the whole) I for one have no fear. I asked you this morning whether you had a man engaged in Ed's place—I hope you will tell me this as I am anxious about itLove to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 18 October 1889"
