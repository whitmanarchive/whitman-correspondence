    "text": "London, Ont.,6 March 1888I got home on Saturday and have had a lively time since, shall be struggling under a waggonload of work for quite a while yet. I wrote to New York Herald (to subscribe) and told them I should take it as long as your pieces continued to appear. Have heard nothing yet from Lippencott[Lippincott] and have done nothing further about my piece but all this will be attended to—The weather here is cold 10° this morning—sleighing good. I found them all well at homeGot your post card 3rd thanks.RMB Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 6 March 1888"
