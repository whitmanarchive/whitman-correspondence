    "text": "Superintendent's Office. ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,28 Aug 1888Many thanks for your note of 26th enclosing frontispiece and leaf from Lippencott[Lippincott]—it must be mighty slow for you staying in one room all the time—I think they ought to fit up the two downstairs rooms for you and have you there—you could sit by the window and see out would be more in the world—do you not think you would like it better? it would be no trouble to make the change—just put all the furniture you needed in those two rooms and live in them day & night—then why not have a low easy carraige[carriage] call round for you occationally[occasionally] on good days and drive a mile or two? It would not be much but it would make a change—I would let the horse & buggy go and arrange for the easy carriage (hire it) in their place—I wish I could better attend to such things—perhaps I will be after a while if the meter turns out as we expect— I wish you would show this letter to Horace and authorise him to move in the matters mentioned or at all events consult him on the points raised—yes, H. is first class, I do not know what we should have done without him—all well here.Your friendRM BuckeSee notes Aug 30, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 28 August 1888"
