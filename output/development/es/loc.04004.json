We have had it fearful hot & tainted here for over seven weeks, but I am alive & kicking yet—it is rainy to-day but warm yet—I shall drive down to your parents in a day or two—(intended to have gone to-day)—Nothing very new with me, much the same old story—H G is here yet—the sculptor Morse also—I remain in good spirits but a pretty bad case bodily.Love to you & E & the little oneWalt Whitman Walt Whitman to Harry Stafford, 24 July 1887"
