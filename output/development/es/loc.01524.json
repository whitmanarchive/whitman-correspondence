    "text": "BrooklynWednesday night Aug 3.Dear Pete,Dear son, I received your second letter to–day, also the Star. I sent you a letter Tuesday evening, which I suppose you have received. As I am now sitting in my room & have no desire to go to bed yet, I will commence another. Give my best respects to George Smith—also to Pensey Bell & his brother George—also to Mr. Shedd—and in fact to all my railroad friends, whenever they inquire after me—Dear son, I can almost see you drowsing & nodding since last Sunday, going home late—especially as we wait there at 7th st. and I am telling you something deep about the heavenly bodies—& in the midst of it I look around & find you fast asleep, & your head on my shoulder like a chunk of wood—an awful compliment to my lecturing powers. All the talk here now is either the war on the Rhine, or the murder of old Mr. Nathan, or some other murder—for there are plenty of them—I send you a couple of papers with pieces about them. Say whether they come safe. I believe that is all for to–night, as it is getting late—Good night, Pete—Good night, my darling son—here is a kiss for you, dear boy—on the paper here—a good long one—Thursday—4th—I have been out all the forenoon & until about 2 o'clock—had some business in New York, which I attended, then came back & spent an hour & a half on the river, with one of the pilots, a particular friend of mine—saw the yachts, several of them, including the America out practising, for the great race that comes off Monday—the Dauntless was out yesterday—& the Cambria went down three days ago—the America is the handsomest little craft I ever laid eyes on—I also saw Henry Ward Beecher & had some talk with him—I find myself going with the pilots muchly—there are several that were little boys, now grown up, & remember me well—fine hearty fellows—always around the water—sons of old pilots—they make much of me—& of course I am willing—10 o'clock at night—As this is lying here on my table to be sent off tomorrow, I will imagine you with your arm around my neck saying Good night, Walt—& me—Good night, Pete—Friday morning Aug 5. All well—fine weather & I feel in good spirits—I am just going out, & across to New York. Walt.We had a heavy shower here yesterday afternoon, 4th—the weather is not too hot here. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 3–5 August [1870]"
