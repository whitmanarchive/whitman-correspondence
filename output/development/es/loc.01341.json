    "text": "8 Berkeley StreetCambridgeWednesday Nov. 12, 1884.Dear Mr. Whitman —Altho I am busy this evening, I must find time to send you word of how very, very much we enjoyed seeing Mr. Quincy Shaw's Millet pictures this morning. Your note I believe gained for Mr. Clifford permission to go and see them, and papa, Logan and I went with him. I hardly ever spent such a delightful morning, and the remembrance is almost as good as the reality was. And, best of all, Mr. Shaw invited Logan and myself to come over any time, and spend quiet, free hours among his beautiful collection. It added not a little to our pleasure this morning to be with a man who knew and loved the artist so well, and we all feel very grateful to you for the pleasure of the morning. Mr. Clifford showed us his sketch of you. We liked the cheery expression—but were not entirely satisfied with the picture.Logan and I will be home soon—for Thanks giving. Papa said \"What shall we do to celebrate your vacation and make you have a good time\"—\"Pursuade Mr. Whitman to come over!\" I said. Well, we certainly shall see you, even if the Daimon doesn't approve of your coming to Germantown—But I hope he will be in a complaisant mood!I had a letter from Mr. Costelloe (one of the Englishmen who came over with me to see you), and he asked me to tell you that he read the little book you gave him to the passengers on the steamer going home, and that both reader and audience enjoyed it sincerely, and were much enlivened and strengthened by the \"wonderful faith and hope\" that breathed through the poetry. You certainly do 'blow grit' into people!But I must not make my letter longer—I shall look forward to seeing you soon, and I hope you will be well. With much love Mary W. Smith Mary Whitall Smith to Walt Whitman, 12 November 1884"
