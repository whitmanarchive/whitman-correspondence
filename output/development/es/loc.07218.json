I am anxious for more proof—you will recollect that the last p. I have is 104—all the rest of the book will be new to me. I do not understand your plans about publishing, you say you may not publish for a while \"for reasons.\" I think myself a good idea would be to print a hundred or two hundred copies on good (and large) paper, bind them nicely and sell yourself for $5. or even $10. with autograph, by & by publish through McKay or another. All well here, will soon write again, been extra busy latelyRM BuckeSee notes Aug 6, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 4 August 1888"
