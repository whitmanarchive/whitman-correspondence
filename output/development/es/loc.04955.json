    "text": "Anderton, near ChorleyLancashire, England.28 August 1890Dear Walt Whitman,I received the \"Camden Post\" on Tuesday morning, the 26th inst, and in the evening of the same day I received the \"Camden Morning News\"—the \"screed\" from \"The Critic\"—and your post card—in reply to which latter I wired to you at once.—It isn't possible for me to write much at present. I have read all the pieces you sent—especially the letter to \"The Critic.\"—It suggests some points I should like to write about, but I must only note one—and that is your remark that you are \"still rejected by the great magazines\" +c.—Well—so much the worse for them! It is only of a piece with your continued rejection by some of your leading men of letters and the absurdly inadequate recognition of those who seem friendly.—I could wish it were otherwise,—and that the solitude of soul in which you have lived might at last, in your old age, be cheered by the advent of a completely intelligent + loving recognition + response. That you are still, in a great degree, \"despised + rejected of men\" is, however, only the price you pay for your greatness, and corresponds with the experience of other great benefactors + redeemers.—But there is a wise encompassing Love which transcends all our thinking—\"Love like the light silently wrapping all\"—which holds both yourself + your work in safe and tender keeping—Future generations will love you all the more passionately for your rejection by your contemporaries, and we who have already come to partly understand you and to love you also love you more proudly and tenderly because of it.Your great kindness—most fatherly, most tender—to Dr Johnston + myself stirs my heart more deeply than I can tell you. We thought it a precious privilege to minister, in however slight a degree to you, and, behold! you load us in return with the most unlooked for and unmerited kindnesses! Thanks to you from my heart—and God bless you!I cannot write more now but I think I will send you a slip I cut from a newspaper last Decbr. I thought of sending it to you at the time + will now do so.—With reverent grateful love alwaysYours affectionatelyJ. W. Wallace J.W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 28 August 1890"
