    "text": "56 Easton Sq. N. W.4 Ap.Dear Whitman,I write in haste, & specially for the busineſs purpose named further in Mrs. Gilchrist & Dowden (who happens just now to be in London) have seen your letter of 17 March, & doubtleſs appreciated it as I do. I have received also your post-card of 20 March, & the Two Rivulets whwhich that announced.What I want to know is the precise fact about the prices &c of your books. The printed slip mentions only Leaves of Graſs £1 ($5), Two Rivulets 1, Mem.Memoranda during war ؚ6/—, & all 3 for £2: & of each of these only 100 copies printed. Is it a fact then that a L.Leaves of Graſs is not anymore obtainable at leſs than £1 nowadays? & that, when 100 copies are sold no more purchasers need apply? w.dwould you kindly tell me precisely about all this. Were it not that I find the uncertainty about this most embarraſsing, & the presumable chance of enlisting purchasers at such high prices much diminished, I shdshould already have drawn up my proposed circular to start the scheme. Perhaps you w.dwould prefer to telegraph back in fewest words: note this as you prefer.Your poems printed in Athenaeum of 1 April.Some minor details when next I write.Your AffectionateW. M. RossettiPlease tell me also how you w.dwould like me to send over the various sums I have received for your books. I presume you w.dwould send the books direct to the purchasers: not but that I w.dwould receive & distribute them if really any object to you, but it w.dwould cause delay to all, & to me some work of a kind at wh.which I am not particularly ready. William Michael Rossetti to Walt Whitman, 4 April 1876"
