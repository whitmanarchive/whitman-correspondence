(the new one)—the children all call me Uncle Walt—the baby is bright & interesting, but not rugged—(I hardly think its tenure of life secure)—I have many invitations, but don't accept them—I have seen John Burroughs & he wants me to go up there to Esopus, but I don't think I shall go—I find my gray clothes very seasonable here, as it is cool enough all the time except at mid-day—I suppose Hattie and Jessie are there, all right—Dear girls, I send you my best love, & I will soon be home & see you—I will finish to-night—Sunday 3½ p mWest Point 50 miles above N YNew York on the HudsonI finish my letter here—having had a very pleasant 3 hours trip up here on the \"Plymouth Rock,\" to Mr & Mrs John Bigelow's (he was U S minister to France)—I met her at Mr. Bryant's funeral & she invited me up here—I came up for the sail, as well as to see the good folks & this beautiful spot—I think it the finest I have ever seen—Had dinner about an hour ago, and in about an hour more, shall return on the boat—Shall get to N YNew York before sundown.The weather is perfect—I am feeling all right—shall probably mail this to you when I get in to-night—Hope you are all well &c—WaltMonday 17th 11 a mI was so tired out & got in so late from the West Point trip that I did not go to mail this last night—At present I am sitting alone in the front parlor with the Park opposite like a dense woods—is pleasant, but cloudy & almost cold to-day—(if I had not my old grays wearing I should be uncomfortable)—Lou, you would like the folks & everything here—especially Mrs Johnston—at meals there is a great big table & the little children sit up the same as any—toward the last the baby & the little 4 year old girl are generally down crawling around on the floor—the whole squad are model children lively & free & children, but no bother & no whimpering or quarreling at all under any circumstances—they form a great part of my comfort here—Yesterday was such a strain that to-day I [am] going to keep still—Best love to you all—I enclose a card—write me about the girls & all—W W Walt Whitman to George and Louisa Whitman, 15–17 June [1878]"
