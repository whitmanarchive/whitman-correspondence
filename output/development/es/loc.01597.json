    "text": "Wednesday evening March 8Dear son,I thought I would write you just a short letter, if no more, as you are in my mind this evening. I sometimes come to the office nights, to read, it is so quiet—and now I am sitting here at my desk, with a good lamp, all alone. So I thought of my dear boy, and will send a few words, though nothing particular to say. Johnny, I wish you would write to me when you receive this, whether you have got work yet. Dear son, if you feel to come on here on a visit, you come with me—you shall not be under any expense for board and lodging. Johnny, I send you my love, & good night for this time—the mail closes at 8, & it is some after 7 now. Walt Whitman to John Flood, Jr., 8 March [1871?]"
