    "text": "[London, Ont.,][20 Jan [188]9]Yours of 17th came to hand yesterday and I left it over till today that I might answer it at leisure. That is grand news about Kennedy's book, that Wilson will really publish it and at once, so it is that the German translation is actually being printed at last. I shall be very glad to get the Springfield Repn cong the \"Whittier, Whitman & Emma Lazarus\" criticism—please do not forget to send it when you can spare it. No, I have received no German papers of any kind from any body for a long time, where are they? If still comeatable send them. [—] We have, thank goodness, a change in the weather, it has been blowing from the East for about twenty-four hours and now (as a natural consequence) it has begun to snow—and it is coming down at a great rate before a driving cold East wind out of a dark gray sky which looks as if it was made of solid snow banks. If we have no disastros change (such as a shift of the wind) we shall have good sleighing tomorrow morning. All well and all quiet here, annual Ball getting pretty near now, a week from thursday—i.e. 1st—soon after that I hope to see you, but we have had no word of our patents yet and there may still be some hitch for all I can tell—but I hope notAddio and Love to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, [20 January [188]9]"
