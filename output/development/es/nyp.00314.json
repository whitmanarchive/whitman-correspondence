I cannot walk any to speak of, but I have been out taking a ride in the cars, and sitting in the parks a little while. Peter Doyle has been with me. It is as pleasant and warm as summer here to-day. I have not rec'd any letters for the last two days— I suppose you got my letter Saturday—I have been out more to-day than any day yet, as it has been so warm & fine—Love to you, mama dear, & to all— Walt.Mother, write me what envelopes you would like to have me direct, & enclose you— I have not been over to the office yet, except that one time ten or twelve days ago. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, [9 March 1873]"
