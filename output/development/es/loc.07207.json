    "text": "Asylum for the InsaneLondon, Ontario12 June 1887Dear WaltI have your card of 9th, I am very glad to hear that there is a chance of Herbert Gilchrist coming this way, please tell him so. You have evidently made up your mind not to go to England and you are wise to have done so. Mr & Miss Smith I suppose sailed yesterday. I am glad to hear of the advent of the little girl Rachel. Wish they would get something settled (one way or the other) about that seaside cottage— if that scheme is not carried out you had better come here yet, you really must not remain in Camden all Summer—I do wish it was settled that you were to leave there soon and where you were going, it must be getting very warm with you—here it is cool and pleasant—no end of grass and trees (you would not know the place the trees have grown so since 1880). I am very anxious to see \"Specimen Days in Am\" and do not understand why I have not a copy by this time, Rhys was to send me one as soon as the book was out—but if you have a copy to share by all means send me one as you propose. I am more and more pleased with the last photo. think it is grand. So J. N. Johnson is still in your neighborhood. You do not say whether he is coming further North, I fear not, but please tell him (if you have not already) that I should like much to have a visit from him if the thing is at all on the cards. I hope you will be feeling better by the time you get this but I doubt if you get much better until you get out of Camden, a change of air would do you more good now than any thing. We are prepared to make you comfortable (if the thing is possible) if you will come to us. I send you my love and am always affectionately yoursR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 12 June 1887"
