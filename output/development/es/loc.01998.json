    "text": "GreeneDec 19th 1869Walt WhitmanDear FriendYou will see by my letter that I have changed my base I am now located in Greene Chenango County selling the Home Sewing Machine, and Pianos and Melodeons. I have been here three months and have done much better than I had any reason to expect I would do when I came here. My family are all here and are well. little Walt is just getting interesting he runs all around and is beginning to talk quite plainly.I do not know but you will think by my long silence that I have forgotten you, but I still remember and Love you as ever.There was about two feet of Snow fell here yesterday and last night which is going to make our Sleighing first rate.I have not heard from Hamilton since I came here and do not know how he is getting along.My Father & Mother were well the last time I heard from them.I hope you will write soonYours with LoveB.H.
