    "text": "ConcordJan. 7, 1868.Walt Whitman:The scope and spirit of your paper on Democracy delight and satisfy me beyond all expectation, and I write without compliment or reserve to the man, the American Columbus, whose sagacity has thus sounded adventurously the sea of our Social Chaos and anchored his thought securely in soil of the newly discovered Atlantides about which Grecian Plato died dreaming. Especially have I to thank you for delivering such doughty thrusts into the sides of the British Behemoth sending him bottomwards. All you say of the Imperial West is strong and IS.I talked last evening with Emerson about your strong strokes at the thoughtless literature and Godless faith of this East—nothing as yet to show of original type—wholly null and empty of ideas—only Thoreau to redeem it from idiocy and fatuity.That dutiful drill of yours, too, in Humanity during the dread struggle of these last years gives to your thought a sanction and potency which Universities cannot claim nor conferPersonallyA. Bronson Alcott. Amos Bronson Alcott to Walt Whitman, 7 January 1868"
