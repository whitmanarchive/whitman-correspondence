It is just perfect, the pictures, book, everythingI am glad to have it, the pictures are very fine,—(I like Mr O ConnorMr. O'Connor) I cantcan't tell you Walt how much I prize the bookI hope to live to see you and have a good talk. I am writing in a hurry, Charlie was going down town. I took a notion all at once to send my pictures, I have not been very prompt have I Walt about the pictures these were taken four months ago, I intended to go and have a full face taken, did go again to Atwoods, he was buisy[busy] these I send of his are bad are not a good likeness, Browns, look more like me. Charlie did not like Browns at all at first (he does not say so much against them now) so of course I felt disappointed. If I get a good full face I will send it. I am afraid these will not be very satisfactory. I dontdon't make a good pictureCharlie starts for the Adirondacks Monday, I have been busy getting his things all right. I dontdon't know how long he will stay some weeks certainly.Dear Walt I am always so glad to hear from you, I think about you often and always I send you and all the rest ever and ever so much love, I am pretty well now have not been quite well, after all there is really no real sickness no disease the only thing about it Walt is I have fretted and worried make myself sick almost sometimes. I must turn over a new leaf & do betterGood bye dearHan Hannah Whitman Heyde to Walt Whitman, [14 July 1883]"
