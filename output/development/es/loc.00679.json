    "text": "I should suffer much if it was not for Ellen Ellen[Ellen]Friday Nov 13 My dear BrotherI have & still suffer so much agony I am like a child I have longed so for a letter I have seen one to Charles with a few lines to me If I could see one of my own folks I see in that letter that you wrote of comeing[coming] I suppose dear brother that is asking too much. I dontdon't suffer now, only my hand, the fever is gone my head is clear my mind has not wandered only when I dozed I sometimes think you have written. I have been truhartedtruehearted or refused so many things I did not like to tell mother but first Charlie was very ugly he would not get a nurse. dear brother I find I am totoo weak to write. Dr Thayer I believe thinks all my thumb wontwon't get well I feel very anxious about it. dear brother write to Dr Samuel B[W] Thayer. & thank him first Charlie refused to let me go for him. Saturday Nov 14. Dear brother I suffered dreadfully last night with my hand the Doctor did not come in yesterday I was greatly frightened about my hand & Charlie scolded me till I thought I should be thrown in a fever again I make very much trouble but I suffer too terribly to be scolded. I think I shall get well if I dontdon't get fever but will suffer much my hand is much more painful you know I cantcan't even be roused in bed on account of raising my hand itsit's hard to write Charlie last night brought me your letter to him I read it many times itsit's strange he did not tell you how I asked so much for letter, you speak dear brother of knowing constantly about my illness. I know that Charlie wrote many times mornings without comeing[coming] in to see what kind of a night I had passed my strength fails. I cantcan't say much but Charlie was kind to about[] about 2 or 3 days then after doctor scolded him if I am to be sick much longer I do so want one of my own that belongs to me & be pleasant to Charlie while I am sick on my account Ellen is very good to me feels interested if I only could I dontdon't suppose Mother being sick & our Mother could come and I am afraid it would be too hard for her I will ask frfor how long before I can get just a little relief from pain if he ever comes Charlie has gone for him I want you to write to him I have often spoken of you let brother of all things in I beg you to not let Charlie know I have wrote to you. I run a great risk risk[risk]. Write to me, at once perhaps Me be better soon my loveHanHe just been & has lanced my arm he says that is the trouble so perhaps Ill[I'll] be better Hannah Whitman Heyde to Walt Whitman, 13–14 November [1868]"
