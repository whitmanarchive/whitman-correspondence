    "text": "Ithaca, N.Y.â€”July 5, 1886.Dear Mr. Whitman:Have you perhaps still any copies left of John Burroughs' book \"Notes on Whitman\"? If so, will you send me one? I enclose $1, and postage. A fellow-worker of mine in the Cornell University Library, Mr. E. H. Woodruff, visited you in the early spring, and brought back a copy of the book I have been interested in for some months. I am glad to say that my interest is not confined to the books written about you. I wish I could tell you, without seeming to manufacture phrases, what a revelation your two volumes, the prose collection and the poems, have been to me. My love for them is growing constantly, and my gratitude to the friend who first made you known to me, is very great.Mr. Woodruff is away now, but I think he said the price of the little \"Notes\" was $1. If this is not right, I will send the rest at once.Very truly yours,Gertrude Van Dusen.Univ. Library.Wilkie Jas Gertrude Van Dusen to Walt Whitman, 5 July 1886"
