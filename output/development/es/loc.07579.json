I have sent you six copies the S piece—Would it facilitate any when you come, (& supposing the leave obtained)—if you went directly from London to Washington, to see & be a few hours with O'C?—or is it best to come to Phila: & go hence to W?Sunday p m Feb: 10Still all well, I believe—Horace last evn'g bro't over four copies of the \"Complete\" in their good half-calf binding—they are superb, the best part being the substantiality, with the rich plainness of the look of them, one is for H himself with a dedication (wh' I have written in just now) & one I keep for you—Look for word f'm Mrs: O'C to morrow.I enc: Mary Costelloe's letter, tho' I dare say you have every minute occupied—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 9–10 February 1889"
