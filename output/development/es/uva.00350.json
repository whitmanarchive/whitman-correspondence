    "text": "Washington, Wednesday afternoon, July 24, 1867. Dear friend,I avail myself of an opportunity to send you, by hands of Mr. Philp, just starting for London, a copy of my Poems, prepared with care for the printers, with reference to republication in England. The Introduction is written by William O'Connor. All is sent you, so that in case there comes any opening, you may have a proper copy, of latest date, prepared by me, to publish from. Of course I do not expect you, & would not permit you, to make yourself the job of running around & seeking after a publisher. Only, please take charge of the Copy—(I hereby clothe you with full power over it)—& should any good chance befal, it is what I would wish a London edition set up from. Mr. O'Connor has shown me your note of April 30, last, to him. I wish to send you, as also to those other friends & well-wishers whom it seems I have in England, my true thanks & love. Many serious & wonderful things have occurred in our dear country, since you & I last met, my friend. But of these I will not now talk. I also have had many deep experiences since. Mr. Philp leaves Washington this evening, & I must hasten my letter. I will add that I remain well & hearty. For occupation I hold a clerkship in the Attorney General's Office here, of pay sufficient, & duties entirely agreeable & consistent with my tastes. I may write you further, by mail, about the book, & other matters. Write me, on receipt of this. Farewell. Walt Whitman. Walt Whitman to Moncure D. Conway, 24 July 1867"
