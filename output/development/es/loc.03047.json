Who is the lady?After much cogitation, I have judged it prudent to withhold any reply to \"Sigma,\" at any rate until next week. We will see whether the Sunday Tribune has anything from anybody.My aim is to attack Marston, terribly, and I don't want to be led off into a side show by an anonymunculus, like \"Sigma,\" if I can help it. I am trying to accumulate materials for the next assault, and have written in several directions, among others to George Chainey. Do you see what the scoundrel postmaster at Boston, Tobey, has done to himâ€”stopped his lecture on you and your book! After stopping the book, they will stop discussion! Here is a text. It will go hard if I cannot make such a cloud belch thunder.I have written to Chainey for full particulars.Don't forget to tell me the price of your book when you write next. Did you send one to Professor Loomis?GoodbyeFaithfullyW. D. O'Connor.Mr. Walt Whitman. William D. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 24 June 1882"
