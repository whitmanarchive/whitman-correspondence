    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIO London, Ont.,27 Sept 1888The fair still goes on. I hear in the hall outside my door the steady tramp and chatter of some dozens of men and women. Weather not so good rainy last evening and cloudy and cold this morning. The Inspector is to be here in a day or two (perhaps today) then things will be livelier than ever—he calls the roll when he comes this time, i.e. sees every patient individually. Nothing new in re meter, we are expecting a man from Montreal every day who will probably go in with us. If he decides to do so we shall be in a position to move. At present we need a little capital and cannot get on without it.We are all well and hearty, Mrs B. took all the children to the fair yesterday, they had quite a time—for my part I quit going to fairs some years ago.I am reading Past & Present— funny, isn't it, to see a man of the 19th century who thinks better of the monastic feudal life of 12th century than of the industrial life of today? And by his own showing they must have been a bad lot those monks and knights—and see Froude's Henry VIII especially as to the monks!I hope you are having at least a tolerable time of it & are getting on with the books.RM BuckeSee note Sept 29, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 27 September 1888"
