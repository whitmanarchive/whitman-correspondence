    "text": "see notes Nov 27 1888Millthorpe nrnear Chesterfield,23 Oct 85.Dear Walt, I had yours of 3 Aug—acknowledging receipt of draft. Sorry to hear you were troubled with sunstroke. I hope you are going on pretty well again now. We were very pleased that the money came in handy—I haven't been in London lately or seen Mrs. Gilchrist or yr.your friend Mary (?) Whittall[Whitall] whom you mention. I rather expect to be that way in about a month or so. Am laid up just now with a kick from my horse—luckily nothing very bad—he struck me (accidentally in a way—the kick being probably meant for another horse that was teasing him) just above the knee on the front of the thigh—so no bones broken, but it is a big bruise and it will be a week or two before I can get about. It is wonderful though how nature sets to work directly to put things right, and it has been peaceable & free from pain. I have plenty to do looking over proofs—I am bringing out a 2nd edition, enlarged, of Towards Democracy—also a criticism of Modern Science wh.which I am interested in & hope it will provoke some discussion—it is a direct attack on the validity of scientific 'laws' & methods generally—not that I don't think Science has been very useful, but that it is time that it should 'climb down' a bit. Do you see anything of yryour young friend McKinsey or has he left Philadelphia? I send you a photo I had taken a little time ago with a young fellow who is an old friend of mine—in Sheffield—it is not very good of me, though very fair of 'totherthe other one. The farm gets on—slowly—but still it moves, and I rather expect in a few months to put it on a distinct cooperative footing. Prices are awfully low—owing apparently to the general depression and the fact that the mass of the people are without money—also perhaps, partly to a growing scarcity of gold. Isabella Ford has had an accident since we wrote, but I do not know exact particulars. She was driving with her Mother & the ponies ran away— Isabella climbed out, probably thinking she cdcould render some assistance, & fell, hurting her shoulder. However, she was much better when I last heard. Hope you keep going pretty well—I often think of you & wish we could have a chat. With loveEdward Carpenter Edward Carpenter to Walt Whitman, 23 October 1885"
