    "text": "July 4thDear Brother Walt,Your paper received and your postal, and I have been wanting to write all the week, but busy as usual, Today is perfectly lovely we had a refreshing rain on Friday and the streets look clean, and every thing bright GeoGeorge is busy as ever, but we generally have an hours or so drive in the evening, and I come home with a good appetite so it must do me good. Last week while I was at market Ida Johnson must have been here, Ed went to the door and he said it was Miss Johnson, have you heard from any of them? Did you see the account of the large fire in the southern part of PhilaPhiladelphia, a Planing mill and lumber yard and 50 houses. The Planing mill was Will Nices the cousin that comes here a good deal, Walt I think you have heard me speak of the child that sister Kate left at her death, she has always been with her fathers[father's] mother, but about a month ago, her grandmother died and we have taken Alice, she is nine years old, and a very good disposition, I took her feeling the care very much, for I really knew so little about her, only seeing her about twice a year but we do not find her any trouble to manage, indeed have been quite surprised to see how she fits right into our household ways, she is quiet, and seems perfectly contented with Tip for a companion, he appears to love her dearly, and they are always together, Alice has only been here since last Wednesday, so of course this is only a short experience. The Perks and the Elversons are away, Mrs Berry and family think of going soon. Mrs Berry says she misses seeing you very much getting on and off the cars, and wishes to be remembered to you. You will miss the fire crackers and noise of the fourth in Canada a lucky miss I always dread the noise. I suppose you are having a good time, and keeping well, we all send love.Lou Louisa Orr Whitman to Walt Whitman, 4 July 1880"
