    "text": "400 Fifth AvenueJune 5, 90My dear Mr. Whitman,I can hardly tell you what pleasure it gave me to meet you—to look into your eyes, to hear your voice, to graspyour hand and to thank you for the brave and splendid words you have uttered.—I recd copies of the Camden Post and I think that I recognize your work in the sound & true tributepaid to me. Sometime I will pay, so far as may be in my power, a fitting tribute to your character and genius. Of course what I said was fragmentary—almost incoherent—giving only the faintest outline—indicating here and there a mountain peak, leaving the rich & beautiful valleys without a word. May many happy years be yours—With thanks I remainYours alwaysR G Ingersoll Robert Ingersoll to Walt Whitman, 5 June 1890"
