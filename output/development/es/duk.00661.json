    "text": "WashingtonTuesday afternoon Oct. 15.Dearest mother,There is nothing new with me—I am well—Mother, I feel as if I wanted to come on there & pay you a little visit—and as I can probably get off for a few days, I shouldn't wonder if I come soon. I think as I am likely to come quite a good deal, I would like in future to pay Sister Lou $1 a day for what time I stop there—I should feel better satisfied & come oftener. It is quite cold here. I am wearing my overcoat—You see, mother, I am likely to prove a true prophet about Greeley—He is not expected here at the White House next March. Mother dear, I hope this will find you feeling comfortable—I will send you a line before I come—which will probably be within a week—Love to you, dearest mother, & to George and Lou—Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 15 October [1872]"
