    "text": "11, Cowley St., Westminster, S.W.London12th Decr. 1888.Dear Walt Whitman,I have been in London this fortnight & more now, & have completely settled at last in this quiet, old-fashioned little street behind Westminster Abbey. From Wales I went to Somersetshire—to King Arthur's Vale of Avallon, for a week; then to Liverpool, to lecture on \"The Modern Novel,\"—on the whole I think the best lecture I have given yet. The practice I had in America, & the vocal exercises that I used to indulge in during my mountain rambles in Wales this fall, seemed to have given me greater power & ease of locution. &c. Ten days ago another chance to lecture cropped up unexpectedly, in the place of a sick man, before a large audience of working men,—chiefly socialists; so I gave them as good an account of Leaves of Grass in connection with my visits to you & to America generally as I could at an hour or two's notice. To my great delight, there proved to be several men there who knew L. of G. & who were able to join with good effect in the discussion afterwards. Again last night I was asked to go to a society's meeting where a paper on L. of G. would be read, by William Clarke, a young lecturer & journalist, & a very able paper it proved to be. During its delivery who should come in but Mrs. Costelloe, with Evelyn Nordhoff, & after the paper, Mrs. C. joined in the discussion, speaking with wonderful ease & grace, & in fact rather casting into the shade the efforts of the rest of us. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. C & Miss N. had to go, & I saw them into a hansom, not expecting of course to see them again; but when an hour later or so I was sauntering home, red glare in the sky in the direction of Grosvenor Road, but on the opposite side of the river, & the sound of fire-bells & galloping horses in the distance, drew me out of my way. On reaching Lambeth Bridge, I found Doulton's great pottery had caught fire in one of its buildings & was making a fine blaze, right opposite Costelloe's; & I went along then, expecting to find some of them on the balcony watching the spectacle. They had not seen it however, & were glad to come out to Lambeth Bridge where we stood till the fire was got under. The effect of the red glare on the water, with the black barges shooting by, & the river fire-engine's steaming up, was singularly striking, especially in contrast with the pale, cold moon which shone on the other side. Altogether a wonderful scene!After being so long in the quiet of the mountains, you can imagine how these excitements of town affect one. Here in Westminster, I am in a capital situation for making the most of what London can give one of a healthy & helpful kind. Charing Cross is only a short walk distant, with the Strand & its theatres & crowded pavements. The river is almost at the back-door, or at any rate only a short street away; so that I have the ferries close at hand, & trains & busses are equally handy. My American trip seems to have given me a new energy of assimilation too. Never before were all the sights & sounds of London so full of suggestion; I think you must have unwittingly given me some of your power of co-ordinating imaginatively the everyday experiences of the crowd & the life of the streets. (By the way, have you seen 'The Century' for Decr.? There's a vivid account of London by Hy. James, with clever sketches by Jo. Pennell, which gives a very true impression of the whole thing.) And now I must stop for to-day, for I have a great deal of work to get through. Don't forget about the promised Novr. Boughs & the collected complete works, which I want to review immediately! with much love,Ernest RhysI hear great account of Gilchrist as Art professor! Tell him the Hobby-Horsemen are so much struck by his success, that they think of following him en-masse to Philadelphia. Ernest Rhys to Walt Whitman, 12 December 1888"
