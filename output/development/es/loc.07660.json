Could you have any one who w'd take the mare & wagon & see them right to deliver to you? If so I wish it so—The vols: Nov Boughs and the big book will be good bits of typography & press work, I think—no special news ab't me—all comfortable—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 2 September 1888"
