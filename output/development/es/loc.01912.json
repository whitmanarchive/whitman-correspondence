    "text": "Ovrenin Gausdal,28 July 1874.Dear Walt Whitman,I write to you these lines from old Norway. I am dwelling here in Gausdal in one of these ancient farms, whose names are perhaps thousand years old. I am walking among these heights—when the great mountains are scattered over the scanty earthand laying on the same place as when for 5-6 hundred years ago the fierce chiefs met with their yeomen and retainers in bloody battles. At present all is very peaceful. The red blood-hours are spread over the whole valley, and good roads have been cut among the dark firs and pines. The river is running through the bottom as a smiling child. Sometimes it is white and reeking with foam as an injured ghost and for two weeks ago it took ago a new bridge as early as I am flowing a feather away with the breath of my mouth. The people is good natured, vigorous and kind hearted. The peasants are still here saying, \"Thou\" to the strangers. A great deal of Englishmen and some Americans are travelling here in Norway.The editor of \"Aftenbladet\" in Christiania told me, that he has forwarded one copy of Elsters criticism to you. I sent another from Copenhagen.I have thought, that it could amaze you to receive some lines from this old proud mountain-country. Don't forget to let me know, if they have duely[duly] reached you.—Rudolf Schmidt Rudolf Schmidt to Walt Whitman, 28 July 1874"
