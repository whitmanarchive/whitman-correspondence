    "text": "470 State StreetBrooklynApril 8th/72Mr Walt WhitmanDrDear Sir: I regret exceedingly the awkwardness which seemed to impress you this morning as a disposition to pry impudently into your business for the purpose of making you a subject of public gossip. Permit me to assure that such a motive was foreign to my mind. My object in calling upon you was simply that of friendly interest which I had been encouraged to think was reciprocal during our brief acquaintance in Washington. If my presence was an intrusion pray pardon it: but do not I beseech you attribute to presumption or idle curiosity that which sprang only from the most disinterested feelings of friendship. Trusting that this explanation will exonerate me from all undeserved suspicion, I have the honor to remain Most respectfullyRedelia Bates. Redelia Bates to Walt Whitman, 8 April 1872"
