    "text": "Insane AsylumLondon OntarioLondon,9 Nov 1890A thousand thanks to you, dear Walt, for the autographs in the books which Horace took east, and for the good bundle of autographed portraits, for the clay tablet and for the \"Specimen Days\" with the good inscription and the little autograph notes which will make it one of the most precious volumes in my W.W. collection.I feel richer than ever now that I have my \"Leaves\" all back again and these treasures added to them and I shall not soon forget Horace's kindness in attending to all this for me—as for you dear Walt I cannot thank you enough for these and for all your other kindnesses.We have had some glorious \"Indian Summer\" days this past week but now it is dark, darkand blowing and raining like all possessed—but I sit here in my good, warm, comfortable office, the work of the morning done and defy satan and the elements.What is this other piece of yours that is to come out soon, Walt? It is something about American poets is it not? And what do you think of my suggestion to write some autobiographical notes, jottings? The more I think of it the more I am persuaded it is the thing for you to doSo long! Love to youRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 9 November 1890"
