    "text": "420, Greene Ave., Brooklyn,April 27, 1889.Dear Mr. Whitman:—I have thought of you often since my call upon you the other day (and before, too, for that matter), and felt, that although I have a copy of your works in my library, I would like one from you Enclosed find ten dollars for one (never mind the change). Please mail it to above address. Give me your \"hand write\" in it if convenient.In talking with the present Editor of the Brooklyn Eagle, the other evening, I learned that you used to be the Editor of that paper. They will have a jubilee soon on the occasion of some anniversary, and, I hope, will acknowledge their obligations to you for giving them a good lift in days agone.With kind regards and love—Yours sincerely,Will Carleton Will Carleton to Walt Whitman, 27 April 1889"
