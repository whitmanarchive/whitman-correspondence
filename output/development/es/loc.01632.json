    "text": "1874431 Stevens st. cor West.Camden, N. Jersey.1874May 22—3¼ p.m.Dear Pete,I hope you will be able to come, as you said in your last—If I knew when & where you would arrive in Philadelphia, I would try to meet you—As I wrote you before you must come to Market st. ferry Philadelphia, a mile and half, or 2 miles from RR depot, & cross over by boat to Federal st Camden—(The Phil.Philadelphia horse cars run Sundays—run down to foot of Market st—but the Camden ones do not—but it is not very far from the ferry in Camden.) I am very much the same—My being disabled & want of Exercise for 16 months, (and many other wants too,) have saddled me with serious dyspepsia & what the doctor calls gastric catarrh, very obstinate, causing me really more suffering & pain than my paralysis—but though I have bad spells enough, thank God I also have middling good ones—& as I write this have just had my dinner, nice salt oysters, raw, fresh & am feeling quite comfortable—Dear son, I shall look for youWalt Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 22 May [1874]"
