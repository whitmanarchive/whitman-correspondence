    "text": "Camden, New Jersey—U S AmericaSept 10, '76Dear friend,I wrote to you three [or] four days ago, by which you must have recdreceived partial list. The list on the other sheet will more fully show you what books I have sent, comprising I believe all the names & remitting subscribers you have sent me—Your two (principal) remittances £28.4 (April 19) and £45.9.6. (June 20) were accompanied with lists of subscribers' am'tsamounts & addresses—the names on which lists & addresses I have carefully followed & sent to. I hope & think I have not missed any. If you discover or know of any so missed, pray notify me at once. Looking over the pretty voluminous correspondence & extracts you have sent me so kindly, the last six months, there appear to be a number of other names, both men's & women's, mentioned, or writing themselves, as ordering the books in letters to you. But of course I have exclusively confined myself to the names & addresses specified in the lists accompanying your remittance–letters, above alluded to. I have been somewhat exercised about those other names. Prof Atkinson\" ArmstrongA G BG L CathcartMrs. DeschampsJ DLady HardyHarold LittledaleC W SDr Todhunter ☞ Nothing has been sent to any of these (D G RossettiC A HowellJ T Nettleship for self & othersH G DakynsHerbert HerkomerRoden NoelA C SwinburneG W FooteCicely Marston& several others—but know no other course than to confine myself to sending to the addresses on your remittance lists only—which I have done. Any errors or oversights will be gladly & promptly corrected on information. I have now plenty of Books, & orders will be complied with promptly. The delay of the last two months in getting ready my second instalment of the 1876 Edition, has annoyed me much—but it is past—& I have as I believe forwarded now every British paid subscriber his or her books, (duplicate sets are yet to go to three or four)—A parcel of 17 Vols.Volumes has gone by Express to RobtRobert Buchanan to subscribers, sent through him to me—Prof.Professor Dowden's 4 sets specified in your list have been sent to his subscribers to their addresses, & Mr. Conway's 3 sets (ordered in his letter to me) to theirs—It is now some weeks since I have heard from you. I want to hear about Mrs. Gilchrist. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William Michael Rossetti, 10 September 1876"
