    "text": "Feb. 11. '85.Prospect. Delgany. Co. Wicklow. Ireland.My dear Walt. I have been too long in acknowledging the receipt of a newspaper containing the short poem about the Arctic singing bird. It is really a thing to give thanks for—a piece of verse that shows poetry at its greatest. Would it be too great a favour to ask for, if I begged you to let me have it in your own handwriting? I suppose Dr Bucke sent you a letter I wrote him about Dr Karl Knortz & his judgment on my translation, which letter I asked him to forward to you. Since then I wrote to Dr K. explaining my views, and asking him if he would revise the M.S. without impairing its literality. I have not yet had an answer to this proposal. If he would take it up in the manner I suggest a really good thing might be made of it. I should earnestly like to see it fairly afloat & before the public in Deutschland. We are settled now pro tem in the County Wicklow on the lower slopes of the Wicklow mountains & about two miles from the sea, which we have a good view of from the windows. We are within easy reach, by train, of Dublin. Which is advantageous for me as I am coming forward in the political line & belong to the Dublin Young Ireland Society. Our President, John O'Leary, is a splendid fellow—a lion-like old man with long full grey beard, jet black 20 years ago, when he was sent to penal servitude for the Fenian rising in '65. He was released after 6 years on condition of not returning to Ireland till '85. He is now trying to instil a spirit of toleration with the rather narrow and bitter patriotism of the National League. He and O'Donovan Rossa were fellow prisoners! so strangely do men's paths diverge. I wonder if you have seen Irving act. I used to admire him very much, & hear he has improved lately. I have seen his Hamlet 12 times—and each time with new interest. T.W. Rolleston.Did you like the translation of the Greek Hymn to Zeus I sent you from Dresden? Thomas W. H. Rolleston to Walt Whitman, 11 February 1885"
