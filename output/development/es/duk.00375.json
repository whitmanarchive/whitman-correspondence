    "text": "Plymouth Mich.Nov 7th 1864Dear UncleI received you letter of Oct 7th & here I am about to write you a reply.Times here have been rather busy Together with the Mass meetings & a Bridial[Bridal] Tour that lasted a week. This was not any of my own luck but to accompany the newly married set was all I was on the Company. I have received only this letter Oct 7th & one writen[written] to My Father of which both reached me the same mail. One came to me from the Regiment that one I answered & a reply came to me. I intend to Answer all of your Kind letters. But this one I have neglected on account of my being a way from home so long. My letter to you at the time I was Poisoned has has not affected me any that time I looked the whole City of Washington over to find youâ€”but I looked in vainMy foot is quite well so much so that one can not tell of my being hit there. Shortly after I came to the city again to be Mounted on a Horse & we layed[laid] in the Defences of Washington the time the Rebels came to attack the City. Then I went up the Shanandoah Valley untill[until] the 24 day of August where I was Discharged. There was some very heavy fighting up there under Phil Sheridan & perhaps he has warmed the Johnnys since then. This Charles Davis I have not heard from since he left for home on a Furlough. Wether[Whether] he came back or not I can not tellDear Uncle you gave me one of your Photographs & I shall always carry it with me in Remembrance of a Kind Friend & one who I have thought a good deal off.I hope that you will over look this neglect of mine in not writing you before this. This is rather bad writing any how & I am a fraid[afraid] you will bother yourself in reading what I have scribbled. My health is very good at present Also the same I wish to you My best wishes gose[goes] with this to youYours very RespectfullyRuben FarwellTo Walt Whitman Reuben Farwell to Walt Whitman, 7 November 1864"
