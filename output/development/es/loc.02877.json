    "text": "50 Marquis Rd.Camden SqJuly 4, 1874My Dearest FriendAre you well and happy and enjoying this beautiful summer? London is, in one sense, a sort of big prison at this time of year: but still at a wide open window with the blue sky opening to me & a soft breeze blowing in & the Book that is so dear—my life–giving treasure—open on my lap. I have very happy times. No one hundreds of years hence will find deeper joy in these poems than I—breathe the fresh sweet exhilarating air of them, bathe in it, drink in what nourishes & delights the whole being, body intellect & soul, more than I. Nor could you, when writing them have desired to come nearer to a human being & be more to them for ever & for ever than you are & will be to me. O I take the hand you stretch out each day—I put mine into it with a sense of utter fulfilment: I ask nothing more of time and of eternity but to live and grow up to that companionship that includes all. 6th. This very morning has come the answer to my question—First I only saw the Poem—read it so elate— soared with it to joyous heights, said to myself—he is so well again, he is able to take the journey into Massachusetts & speak the kindling words—Then I turned over and my joy was dashed. My Darling! such patience yet needed along the tedious path! Oh, it makes me long with passionate longings, with yearnings I know not how to bear, to come, to be your loving, cheerful companion, the one to take such care, to do all for you, to beguile the time, to give you of my health as you have done to tens of thousands. I do not doubt either, but that you will get well. I feel sure, sure it will be given me to see you And perhaps a very slow, gradual recovery is safest is the only way in this as in other matters, to thoroughness & a very speedy rally would be specious, treacherous in the end, leading you to do what you were not yet fit for. I believe if I could only make you conscious of the love, the enfolding love my heart breathes out toward you, it would do you physical good. Many–sided love—Mothers love that cherishes, that delights so in personal service that sees in sickness & suffering such dear appeals to an answering limitless tenderness—wife's love— ah you draw that from me too, resistlessly—I have no choice—Comrades love, so happy in sharing all, pain, sorrow, toil, effort, enjoyments, thoughts, hopes, aims, struggles, disappointment, beliefs, aspirations. Childs love too that trusts utterly, confides unquestioningly.—Not more spontaneously & wholly without effort or volition on my part, does the sunlight flow into my eyes when I open them in the morning than does the sense of your existence enter like bright light into my awaking soul. And then I send to you thoughts—tender, caressing thoughts—that would fain nestle so close—ah, if you could feel them, take them in, let them lie in your breast, each morning.My children are all well, dear Friend. Herbert is going to spend his holidays with his brother in Wales—& we shall all go to Colne as usual the end of this month & remain there through August and September so if you think of it, address any paper you may send to Earls Colne, Halstead, because I should get it a day sooner. But it does not signify if you forget & send it here; it will be forwarded all right. Beatrice has just got through one of the Govern. Exams, in elementary mathematics; and I hope Herby has got into the Academy, but do not know for certain yet. He works away zealously and with great delight in his work. William Rossetti and his wife are coming to dine with us Wednesday—they look so well and happy, it does one good to see them. The Conways are going to Ostend, I think, for their holiday, & when they come back are going to move into a larger house. I heard an American lady, Miss Whitman, sing at a concert the other day, who delighted me, fascinated me—I longed to kiss her after each song, though some of them were poor enough Verdi stuff—but she contrived to impart genuineness & beauty to them. I hope you will hear her when she returns to America, which will be soon, I believe.Good bye, dearest Friend—Beatrice Herby & Grace join their love with mine. I had the sweet little Bridal Poem all safe, & by the bye I liked that Springfield paper very much. Your loving Annie. Anne Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 4–6 July 1874"
