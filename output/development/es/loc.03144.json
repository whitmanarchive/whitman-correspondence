    "text": "HOTEL CHATHAM67 & 69, RUE NEUVE ST AUGUSTINPARISMy dear Walt Whitman.In London last month I met many mutual friends who were asking after you and wondering when you would come over to the \"Great Smoky Capital\" friends who know you only by your books. Last winter Story of Rome, the author of \"Cleopatra\" you remember, asked me for your photo, and I gave it him to contemplate and he has it yet: Are you coming, and when? Most like I shall return to the States this winter and then visit Washington for I have never yet seen our national Capitol.The news of the great democratic vistas has first reached us and all Paris—that in all American Paris—is teribly[terribly] excited: Of course this suits me, born democrat as I am, but I trust it will not at all disturb the future of the[thee] my dear friend the \"good gray poet.\" My address is the Langhorne Hotel, London. Drop me a line.Yours fittfully,Joaquin Miller Joaquin Miller to Walt Whitman, [6 November 1874]"
