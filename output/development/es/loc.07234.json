    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIO London, Ont.,8 Sept 1888The weather has fallen into the sulks but I don't let that trouble me at all—just jog along and pay very little attention to it—It will come round all in good time and we shall have a grand fall yet I do not doubt. The hot weather must be about over even with you and the pleasant cool autumn days will surely revive you and cheer you up. I hope you will be able to get out a little in an easy carriage before the cold weather comes.I fancy Herbert Gilchrist must be with you by this time—give him my kind regards and tell him I hope to see him in Philadelphia before long—i.e. if he makes any stay—I am in hopes he will take a run west and see the Asylum before he goes back to England. Yesterday was my wedding day—we are 23 years married—getting to be quite old folk! We had some people in in the evening, had quite a pleasant time. Nothing new about the meter—nothing much can be done until the patents are secured and this will take some weeks yet.Your friendRM BuckeSee notes Sept. 10, '88 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 8 September 1888"
