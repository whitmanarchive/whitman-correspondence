    "text": "Meltonsville, Alabama,November 9 1875Walt Whitman—Continued good-will well-supported by a constantly enlarging sense of your great merit as a writer fitted to both please and instruct, leads me to write this after quite a spell of silence. I can make it, tho'though, only a sorry sort of an Appendix to the series of letters I was sending you through the first half and seventh month of the year. The intention or one purpose of these letters being to divert you with a phase of life that probably not fail to be new to you. As I have sometimes said many years past, it is doubtful whether any one could imagine a human character certainly but that the wide world could furnish one specimen to fill its requirements—so, on the other hand, it is altogether impossible for one individual considerably or markedly different from all have come under the observation of any one man. And this is a good answer to those fools who say there cannot be so much as one perfectly honest man on earth. I have said I was fully convinced there are men who would not yield their integrity for an endless life and as much gold as half the bulk of the earth with the other half to spend it on at present value—nor would they accept the throne and prerogatives of God on such condition (of being unjust).In your first letter (more than a year ago) you said you would \"much, much\" like to \"look in upon\" me—well, you have looked in upon a real, live, \"good enough\" and also (by jingo!) not too good a man—a sincere, enthusiastic admirerer, and yet in such told and untold particulars as we might differ about, a man \"sufficient for himself\" and whom laws, theories \"conventions\" and even other Philosophers and Poets shall not \"muster\"—And so I ask you, did I not conduct my part of that correspondence rightly? For, naturally one whose acquaintance should be sought by another man would wish to know—what does he want? where is he? and what is he? This is enough.(My last before this were July 18 and Aug 14I will relieve you of any fears that I shall (of myself be wanting to write and be written to so frequently hereafter—whereupon looking for anything from you it creates a \"fiendish expectation\" that troubles me on account of the way to and from the Post Office 3½ X 2 = 7 miles—ordinary mail matter I generally wait for the pleasant season or some insight to pass to you are publishing anything new I would like to have it if you can credit me for it send pay.(Your last a card Aug 13)The autumn and November season, usually by far the loveliest of all the seasons here, has been much trespassed upon by spells of cloudy and rainy weather like our common winterweather—beyond any precedent. The sharp frosts just before and about Oct 15, coming before the forest foliage had matured enough to drop spontaneously, our superabundance of wildwood was clad two weeks ago with unusual, surpassing splendor and sweetness, but now, much of the glory is gone. Perhaps to the eye of a Poet and true Philosopher the ripe cotton ball is beautiful as the rose—then shouldn't the cotton field be a rose-garden without thorns? ☞ Put me to kneeling, crawling, sitting, squatting among the cotton rows, fingers busy with the beautiful and useful, and thoughts flying undisturbedly over all the earth in search of congenialities and reminiscences and then I am a ever so happy diminutive Philosopher and Poet. Of all work I have always liked cotton-picking the best. And now let this bit of gossip be respectful and kind leave taking or a part of something to be continued at long interval as may suit you best.Bless you Poet! J. N. Johnson John Newton Johnson to Walt Whitman, 9 November 1875"
