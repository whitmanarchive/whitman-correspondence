    "text": "New York16th Feby '65My Dear Walt Whitman:On the receipt of your favor of the 26th ult., I arranged with Captain Walton for the sending of a box to our dear and brave boys at the Danville Military Prison. And to-day I am having a box put up which will start tomorrow.Captain Wright does not think the boxes will ever reach our boysâ€”but this shall not prevent my trying to get them things to keep the breath of life in them, and to cheer them up.Of the articles you enumerate, I omitted tobacco, fearing it could perfume and render the food impalatable. I added dessicated[desiccated] vegetables in its' stead.It is about time you heard from the first box you sent. Have you?If the accounts in the papers are correct, we ought to have the boys back again before long. I hope their turn for exchange will come first.Major Marsh has arrived back at the regiment again, after a short visit here.A letter from Capt. M. Ready just brings me word that they are in good spirits after the movement on the left. Very truly Yours,Elliot F. Shepard Elliot F. Shepard to Walt Whitman, 16 February 1865"
