    "text": "Sutton Court.Pensford.Bristol.Dear Mr WhitmanI send you here two stanzas written by me and addressed to you. I have taken this liberty at the suggestion of my uncle Mr Symonds, to whom I showed the verses, and by whom I was assured that my sending them would not be looked upon by you in the light of an impertinence. With the exception of a single line they are just as I wrote them two years ago some few weeks after your book first fell into my hands Mr Symonds bids me tell you something of myself. I was born in the year 1860. I am second son of what is here called a \"country-gentleman\" I have never been to any of our great public schools, but have got the little I know of the classics under various private tutors. I hope by next Christmass[Christmas] to have entered Balliol College Oxford. Owing to my want of a public-school training, I have not as yet been able to do much in the way of athletics I hope however when I get up to Oxford to do some rowing. With many hopes that you continue better in healthBelieve me dear Mr WhitmanYours very trulySt. Loe StracheyIThine is no carol of weak love or hateThine is no song by listless idlers sung,No poor attempt to cheat us from our fate,No shallow words from the shallower fancies wrung;These are not thine, thy music pure is flungFrom out a heart that throbs, and pants, and achesWith its great love, our suffering race amongThou com'st with thy great gift of song, that makesAll things seem bright and clear, all lovelier vision wakes.IIThough now the world is deaf, and will not hearThough now the foolish rail, and sneer at theeIt matters not their frowns thou dost not fear;Thou know'st the day will come, the how will beWhen thou in love with him of Gallile,Shalt have thy place not yet the years must waneAnd thought from Superstition curse be freeWhen this is ended thou with him shalt reignStrong in all hearts, as loved, and mighty brothers twain John St. Loe Strachey to Walt Whitman, 12 July 1877"
