    "text": "40 Grosvenor Road,Westminster Embankment,S.W.Dear Mr. Whitman—I am writing to you from Mary's to tell you about her and her dear little baby, four weeks old. It is another little girl to be called Katherine Elizabeth, but Karin (pronounced like the \"a\" in 'car') for short. She is a dear good little baby with large blue eyes, and Ray is so pleased with her little sister. She calls her \"isser\" & likes to kiss & stroke her. Mary is not as well as she ought to be, a toublesome wisdom tooth having followed the appearance of the baby, and that is why she hasnot written to you, though she has thought of you very often. The rest of us are all well & very pleased to be back in England again. Father & Mother & I spent the winter in France & Italy & we enjoyed the trip very much indeed, but still nothing compares to London & to the dear old Thames running by us here.Mr. Rhys & his sister are near neighbours of ours in Westminster & I have seen the sister once since I came home. I think she is very pretty & charming, as you said.Have you seen that novel \"The Story of an African Farm\"? We saw a good deal of the author, Olive Schreiner, when we were in the Riviera, & she is such an interesting girl. She has wonderful dark eyes & a lovely expressive face, & her conversation is most delightful. I wish that she were going to America instead of back to Africa, so that you could see her.— Mary sends you a great deal of love & so do I, dear Mr. Whitman. We hope you are pretty well. Will you give my love to Mrs. Davis?Yours affectionatelyAlys SmithA special message of love from me. Mary.June 21st. They have reached London safely. Mr. Smith much better for the voyage. Alys Smith to Walt Whitman, [10] June 1888"
