But he was called away by the death of his mother, + will not be able to report more fully till his return.We all have more or less of cold in the head + throat, but are otherwise well. Am going in to Athenaeum this afternoon to look up + read some of O'Connor's stories. My Whittier is in Funk + Wagnall's safe + is highly complimented by the editor of the series. So glad you are doing tolerably well. I'm off for eggs now.bye-bye.W. S. Kennedy. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 26 January 1890"
