Have you got so that letters and all outside news are not altogether painful intrusions? Hoping so I send just a line. (For a while I thought it must be some false report—I was in Boston at the time—& waited & waited until confirmed.)I am as well as any of late years—or perhaps better. My brother & sister are well. The Staffords the same. I am writing this in the sunshine up in my old 3d story room—Best best love to you & to Herby & Grace—Walt WhitmanI send a Ledger with Arthur Peterson's letter— Walt Whitman to Anne Gilchrist, 28 November 1881"
