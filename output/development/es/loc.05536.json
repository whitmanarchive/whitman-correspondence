    "text": "New Year's Day—28 Terrassen Ufer, Dresden.I return herewith the printed slips with Dr. Knortz's translations. That of the 'Out of the Cradle endlessly Rocking' is of really splendid power, & would be perfect but for some curious failures to understand the English—e.g. 'that low and delicious word'—low is translated 'gemein' (= vulgar) instead of 'leise' (low in sound, tone). 'Absorbing' is rendered 'absorbed in thought'—the word stronger and sweeter than any' he has read as 'world'! &c. I have translated the said poem, and was just writing the last two or three lines, when the cannons boomed and bells rang announcing the New Year last night. I got your postcard, & sent copies to Dr. K. and Schmidt. The latter has kindly sent me something of his in return, which unfortunately I can't read, not knowing Danish. But it has such a tantalising resemblance to German that I mean to learn it—enough for reading purposes. Many thanks for the copy of the Critic, recdreceived yesterday. Matt. Arnold himself said that he feared he should see little or nothing of the real America, & he is right. The misery of the poorer classes in England is fast reaching the intolerable point & friends there say there is certainly a tremendous catastrophe & overturn impending. Fortunately such a thing is not likely to prove fruitless, if it does happen, for people know now pretty well what they want—that is—State guarantee that as long as there is food in a community, no person willing to work, shall want. That is to say, society to be organized on the human, not on the wild-beast principle. \"The Age of Feudalism\" says Carlyle \"perished—having produced the still more indomitable Age of Hunger.\" And the Age of Hunger will prove more indomitable than that of 'Competition' too. I wonder do you know a man called Carpenter (Edward), lives in England, has written a book called 'Towards Democracy' of which he will surely have sent you a copy? He is doing much good work there—issues pamphlets, lectures, &c. against the Tyranny of capitalism—Is it not certain that you in America will have all this to go through some day when you get more densely populated & the squeeze begins? And wouldn't it be well to put things on a right footing now, instead of waiting till vested interests, &c. accumulate & force justice & charity to appear in the guise of avenging angels?T W Rolleston.Now our winter weather Will you send a line to say if these reach you safely? Thomas W. H. Rolleston to Walt Whitman, 1 January 1884"
