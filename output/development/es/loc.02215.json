    "text": "The Critic743 BroadwayNew YorkDear W. Whitman:The 22d of February (Washington's Birthday) being the seventieth anniversary of the birth of Mr. James Russell Lowell, it is our intention to publish on that date a number of The Critic consisting mainly of personal estimates of, and greetings to, the distinguished poet, satirist and statesman.Should you care to make the tribute a more memorable one by adding your congratulations to those of the other distinguished men and women whose names will appear in this special number, we should esteem it a privilege & make room for as many words—or as few—as you may care to write.We need hardly add that Mr. Lowell knows nothing of the intended compliment, which we trust will surprise as much as it must please him.Whatever you may send should reach us by Feb. 19.Very sincerely yours,Joseph B. Gilder12 Feb. '89 Joseph B. Gilder to Walt Whitman, 12 February 1889"
