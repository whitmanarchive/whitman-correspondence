    "text": "CamdenOct: 16 '89 Noon—Sunny splendid day—have had a good bath &c.—feeling so-so—Ed has gone over to my friend Tom Donaldson's—D seems to take a fancy for Ed & he reciprocates—I am siting here in the den in my big chair—Ed is leaving here soon Londonward—is there any special thing you want to commission him to get or bring for you? McKay has gone off on a short drumming trip to New York and Boston—y'rs rec'd last evn'g—mutton & rice broth, Graham toast & tea for my breakfast— 3 1/2 p m Sun & splendor continued—no visitors—no letters—Kennedy sends Boston Transcript regularly—I sent it on to Mrs O'C in Wash'n—but she is now in Boston—Ed still over in Phil—have been looking over Horace's book further—some pages are very inspiriting & encouraging especially Sarrazin's and Symonds'—but the main wonder- fact of it all is that L of G. seems quite decidedly to have, or begin to have, a real and \"respectable\" and outspeaking clientelage— Am having a pretty comfortable day—they have hung an electric at the corner above & it glints in here like moonlight after dark, very pretty. I sit in the dark & enjoy it. God bless you all in your risings up & lyings down— Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 16 October 1889"
