    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington. Jan. 20, 1869. James T. FieldsDear Sir:The package of February magazines, sent on the 16th, arrived safely yesterday. Accept my thanks. I am pleased with the typographical appearance, correctness, &c. of my piece. I enclose a piece, \"Thou vast Rondure, Swimming in Space,\" of which I have to say to you as follows. It is to appear in the April number of the London Fortnightly Review. Having just received a note from the editor of that Review, Mr. Morley, in which he intimates that he has no objection to its appearing simultaneously in America, I thought I would show it to you. Very possibly, you will not care any how to print a piece which is to appear elsewhere. Should that, however, be no objection, and should you consider the piece available for your purposes, the price is $20. Of course it would have to go in your Number for April. I reserve the right of printing in future book. Respectfully, &cWalt Whitman Walt Whitman to James T. Fields, 20 January 1869"
