    "text": "Camdennoon July 19 '89 Pretty fair with me personally to-day—warm spell over two weeks but I keep up amid it (but every week or month a button or peg gives out—most of the time mildly—but I realize it well enough—my sight & hearing are quite markedly dulling)—warmth shaded a little to-day & cloudy any how—ate a rare egg & some Graham bread & coffee for my breakfast—eat two meals a day & moderate & plain, but relish them—sit here alone, as now, quiet & middling comfortable—rather an unfair night last (not common)—bladder botherations—bowel action this forenoon—I enclose Eldridge's rec'd to day, as you might like to know—Where & ab't Marvin I don't know—I will send you \"Donnelly's Reviewers\" right away—I lent it to a friend & have just sent for it but could not get it this forenoon—Mrs: O'C is yet at Wash'n, but expects to break up soon I think—Yr's rec'd & welcom'd as always—love to you & 'Sula & Julian—I have a big book (my \"complete works\" in one Vol. rather cumbersome) for you, John—send these (both) to Dr Bucke—Walt WhitmanThe \"Donnelly\" booklet comes now & I send it to you same mail with this—United States Internal Revenue,San Francisco,July 13th, 1889Dear Walt:—You will see by the enclosed card that I have returned to the Internal Revenue service. I regretted to leave Los Angeles and the practice of law, but times got very hard there, and although I had some important cases and good fees in prospect I was unable to realize the cash proceeds; so I applied and got my present portion—same that I held before.—I hope to resume practice in the state, some time in the future, when I have paid my debts and saved a little money.—I am now a citizen of California and hope to always remain such. I should not be contented to settle down in the East, again, I think.—The death of William O'Connor though long anticipated, was a great shock when the news came—What a wealth of intellectual enthusiasm and power was there extinguished, if it could be so: but I don't believe he or any of us can go out like a child's carlacue in the night. I have faith to believe that we shall all meet again on the other side of Jordan, & if we can only have such good times as we had of yore in Washington I shall be content. My mother is still living in Boston at the age of 75, well and hearty. Thank God—I have not seen her for two years, and more.I read with much emotion in the Philadelphia & Camden papers the account of your Seventieth Birthday dinner. I was especially touched by John Burroughs letter.—I am indebted to you for many papers—Always glad to get them.—Address me until further notice simply Internal Revenue Agent. San Francisco. Cal. I hope you are fairly comfortable.—God bless you my old and long tried friend—\"With fond affection and recollection.Ever yoursCharles W. Eldridge Walt Whitman to John Burroughs and Richard Maurice Bucke, 19 July 1889"
