    "text": "CamdenApril 25 towards noon A pleasant day out & I am feeling better than for two weeks past—Drove down yesterday three or four miles to Gloucester, on the Delaware below here, to a fine old public house close to the river, where I had four hours & a good dinner of planked shad & champagne—had a good view of the picturesque sight of the great boat, 20 black men rowing rhythmically, paying out the big seine—making a circuit in the river, (here quite a bay)—enjoyed all & was driven back to Camden ab't sundown—So you see I get out & have fun yet—but it is a dwindling business— I enclose an old note from Kennedy. Mrs Louise C Moulton was here day before yesterday—two English travelers a couple of hours later—Did I acknowledge & thank you for your good letter of a week ago?—Last evn'g came a little eng: from one of J.F. Millet's pictures—a present from Felix Adler of N Y—Best love & remembrances to you both— Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 25 April 1888"
