But so you know my dear friend they are all real to me—and I often keep them months before I destroy them.—Many and many a mile have I rode on a Locomotive while in charge of a Freight-train and had you by my side in conversation—which to me was as really a presence as in years gone by on the box of a Broadway stage—or a Sleep and lounge on the deck of a Fulton Ferry Boat—Walt in all your Sorrow that has been made public, I have sorrowed with you—Most especially in the death of Dear Mother, and your own illnessIf you can Dear Walt write to me and acknowledge the receipt of this—If you cannot, I shall still keep writing, in my own wayAs Ever & always:—Yours,Fred B. VaughanCare Leviness & Webber164 Fulton St.Brooklyn. Fred Vaughan to Walt Whitman, 11 August 1874"
