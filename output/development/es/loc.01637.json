    "text": "Jan 23, 74431 Stevens st. Cor West.Camden, N. Jersey,Jan 23d 74Friday, 1½ p.m.Dear Boy Pete,74Your letter came Wednesday—You must try to cultivate & keep up a gay & cheerful heart, & shed off botherations, & the impositions of employers, &c. as a duck sheds water in a rain storm—that's the best capital a fellow can have through his whole life, I find. I am only so-so—had a very bad night last night—it's a tough pull Pete—still I think I shall come out of it—We are having it very mild here now—after snow & cold the first of the week—too mild, like April to-day, cloudy & some rain. I keep myself some busy writing—have a piece in Harpers' Monthly just out (February)—shall have another in the March number—Can't seem to do, without occupying my mind through the day—nights are worst for me—I cant[can't] rest well—has been so now for a month—But I must not fill my letter with my complaints—To-day is just a Year, since I was paralyzed, (23d Jan.January '73)—What a year it has been to me—Good bye my loving boy—write me all the news & gossip. Walt Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, [23 January 1874]"
