    "text": "CHARLES MORRIS, AUTHORP.O. Box 557.RESIDENCE, 2233 SPRING GARDEN ST.Philadelphia, July 19th 1886Walt Whitman, EsqDear Sir I wrote to you some time ago, but receiving no answer fear my letter must have miscarried. The subject of it was to request permission to use a selection from your poems in a collection of choice extracts from American Literature which I am preparing. The title of my work will be, \"Half Hours with the Best American Authors,\" and it will be confined to the writings of those who have or are likely to have a just claim to be included in this category. In such a work a selection form your writings is highly desirable, and the one which I desire to use is the poem entitled \"The Song of the Redwood Tree.\" I should be glad to have your permission to use this selection, and of course will make the usual acknowledgement of its source. An early answer will much oblige. Yours TrulyCharles MorrisI had a conversation yesterday with your publisher D McKay, who freely gave me permission to extract from another work on his list. My work will be in 4 volumes, and published in creditable style. A hielan' lad my lo' was bornThe lowland laws he held in scornBut he still was faithful to his clanMy gallant, braw John Hie'landmanWi his philabeg an' tartan plainAnd guid claymore down at his sideThe ladies' hearts he did trepanMy gallant braw John HielandmanSing hey, my braw John Hie'lan'manSing ho, my braw John Hie'lan'manThere's not a lad in all the lan'Can match with my John Hie'lan'man For Given to me by Walt Whitman and copied in his & now to me with love to Horace Traubel 1918 Charles Morris to Walt Whitman, 19 July 1886"
