    "text": "CamdenThursday noonOct. 25 '88First thank you for your good affectionate letter, inspiriting more than you knew—That seems to me too long, condensed, dwelling a pull proof reading work—pressing work too on the delication of the brain—I had a friend a woman of 30 a counter in the Redemption Bureau in the Treasury—told me she was \"going to the devil fast & steady\" (her own description) from her dense brain‑exhausting‑dulling labors, till she adopted the plan of getting a 10 or 12 minutes' nap (sleep or even doze) at noon or one oclock every day, just leaning down at her desk—fortunately she could fall in her nap—wh' is the great part of it—at any rate it cured——I heard from Bucke to-day—he sends me the enclosed little slip from O'C—the condition is bad, & I feel pretty gloomy ab't my best friend—yet he has great vitality & may tide over it——Nothing very different with me—Dr Ostler (very 'cute, a natural physician, rather optimistic, but best so)—thinks I am either on a very good way, or substantially cured of this last attack—I only wish I could feel so, or even approximate it—But any how thank God so far my thoughts & mental power are entirely within my control—I have written a short letter to Critic (by their request) on the \"poet\" question (wh' they may print)—My sister—George's wife—has just paid me a good cheery visit (with some nice home made Graham biscuits)—So I get along well, am comfortable, have a fair appetite, & keep a good oak fire—LoveWalt WhitmanPlease send this to John Burroughs with slip [Over] Walt Whitman to William Sloane Kennedy and John Burroughs, 25 October 1888"
