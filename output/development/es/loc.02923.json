    "text": "The Manse,Maryhill,Glascow.Scotland. 28 August 1889 Dear Sir In your \"Specimen days & collects[collect]\" p. 327. (American Ed 4th.) speaking of American society you designate the religion of Boston as \"bloodless.\" The word surprises me as I always thought that the greatest literateurs of the states such as Hawthorne, Longfellow, Emerson, had given their to that very religion you describe as bloodlessâ€”Unitarianism. Though surprised however I quite concur in the description. But may I ask if you think the church, Protestant or Catholic is capable of grappling with the spiritual problems of our age? Mr. Froude the historian whose books I prize and who has written much on Ecclesiastical Matters has never I think spoken so sharply or tersely of Unitarianism as you have done nor given any indication as to whether Christianity as the Church teaches it is able to mould the centuries to come. As I am deeply interested in this question it would be a great favour if you would write me a line or two Yours faithfully John Oliver (ov P.S. Have you a first Edition (American) of \"November Boughs\" to sell. If you kindly let me know I shall forward the price. J.O. John Oliver to Walt Whitman, 28 August 1889"
