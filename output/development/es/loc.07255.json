    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,11 Oct 1888I have your welcome letter of 9th. enclosing slip re Osler. I am rejoyced to see by your letter that you are keeping so, so—not going back any, at all events, I judge. I have had a bad time with Inspector and other botherations but it is all over now for the present thank heavens. A very few days will wind up my report and then I should be comparatively free. Wm Gurd is with me, he goes to N.Y. next Monday—I to follow as soon as patents all safe and we shall both proceed at once to Phila. Way things look now I do not expect to get away for the East untill nearly or quite the end of the month. I have had short allowance of sleep lately—not insomnia but late to bed. last night I turned in at 8 and slept 10 hours without waking—pretty good wasn't it? Today feel first class. I send you with this a photo of self. Let me know how you like it. I don't agree with McKay as to cover of \"N.B.\" I like it—don't believe his will be as good. Am glad you are at the autographing—guess I shall be with you before the big book issued? It takes a lot of work to get out such an ed. as that but it will be a big thing when done—guess it will be the sacred text by & by. The 1st Folio of S. is valuable but I guess after a little that autograph \"C.W.\" of W.W. will lead it in the market. Burroughs forwarded me O'C's letter to you of the 5th. He is a grand fellow that the grandest of all your friends—a hero.Your friendRMBuckeSee notes Oct 13, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 11 October 1888"
