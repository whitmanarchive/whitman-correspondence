    "text": "59 Cheyne WalkChelsea,London, S.W.31st May 1885Dear Walt Whitman,I have long wanted to write to you—just in the way of comradeship and greeting, and two years ago did begin a letter, when living among the miners of the North, on your birthday night; (I enclose a leaf from a journal of the time, to show how old the intention is;) to-night however there is further cause which I hope you will think warranty enough, if indeed it is not foolish to speak of wanting any warranty in this sense at all. Before turning to the more immediate purpose of these lines, though, let me say simply in a young man's way to you who are an old man now, how dearly and earnestly I think of you across the sea to-night, remembering the Past, looking on to the great to-morrow, for perhaps of all young men you have helped me most powerfully & perfectly. So if I do not frame exact wishes in birthday fashion, it is because the usual formula is all useless. (I had not remembered it was your birthday this morning, and in not the best of states of health went off with \"Leaves of Grass\" under my arm to Chelsea Hospital, & lay there under a tree—the sun shining summerly—reading, until suddenly I found myself on the way back full of vigour and energy for work. Then bethinking that your birthday fell in May, I took up \"Memoranda of the War,\" and there behold:—31st! and I determined to write before bed-time. All day you have been my only companion, for I live alone in this happy garrett of mine, & except the folks of the house have not seen a familiar face, though I went off to see the fashionable, foolish crowd in Hyde Park this afternoon. So the day has been sacred to you as it were: and you have been unwittingly a guest in this little room, where I have entertained Shakspeare & Chaucer & other great souls before this.)The special message in hand referred to before is about a proposed edition of your poems in a small popular series—called (foolishly & without reason), \"The Canterbury Poets.\" When the series had been already begun, a friend of mine,—Joseph Skipsey, (a former coal-miner, a genuine poet in speech if not in writing, and a noble soul,) was asked to assist in the editing. So when a few months back I saw in an advert'mt. your name in the list of proposed poets, having then already left the North for London, to study life & literature here,lung-inflammation—serious to so old a man, but happily seems to be recovering, happily for me at any rate that is, who know[knows] few people in this great London. And now, hoping you will be able to send me one word of sanction & greeting at least.I am, dear Poet,Yours affectionatelyErnest RhysThe enclosed leaves of grass are from Chelsea Hospital grounds, picked this morning & put in the vol. I had with me. They will redeem anything poor in my words.A very wondrous sky as I finish;—the moon rising from a great range of black mountainous cloud into a blues/serene night sky over the old Thames. Ernest Rhys to Walt Whitman, 31 May 1885"
