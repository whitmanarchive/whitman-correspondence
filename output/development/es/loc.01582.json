    "text": "Dear Lewy,I will write you just a line, to let you know I have not forgotten you. I am here on leave, & shall stay nearly all this month. Duffy is here, driving on Broadway & 5th av. line. He has been up the Hudson river this summer driving hotel coach. He is the same old Duffy. I have heard that William Sydnor on 65, was laid up sick. I wish to hear about him, & whether he is well, & again at work. If you see him, tell him I have not forgot him, but send him my love, & will be back in Washington again. Tell Johnny Miller there is still a sprinkling of the old Broadway drivers left. Balky Bill, Fred Kelly, Charley McLaughlin, Tom Riley, Prodigal, Sandy, &c. &c. are still here. Frank McKinney & several other old drivers are with Adams Express. Staging is rather dull. Walt Whitman to Lewis Wraymond, [2 October (?) 1868]"
