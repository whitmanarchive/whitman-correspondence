    "text": "[London,]Nov. 9th 79My dear Walt WhitmanFor the last two weeks I have been expecting to hear from you every day, and I did hope to have seen you before this time. A week ago I supposed that you had gone East but as I have not received a copy of \"Leaves of Grass\" from you I now begin to think that perhaps you have not got on as well as you expected and that you are still ill in St Louis.If this is the case it may be that you are short of moneyâ€”if you are and will let me I will gladly send you a hundred dollars. This you may look upon as a loan (to be paid by ten copies of \"Leaves of Grass\"), or a gift, or (more justly) as a small instalmentinstallment of the infinitely greater debt than that which I owe you. In any case, look at it as you please, I hope you will not refuse to take the money if you have any need of it at all.Could I be of any use to you there I will ask at once for a weeks leave of absence (which I know I can get) and go at once to St LouisI am affectionately yoursR M BuckeKind letter from Dr Bucke | offering money | (declined with thanks) Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 9 November 1879"
