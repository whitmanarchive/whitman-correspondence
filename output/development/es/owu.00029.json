    "text": "40 Grosvenor Road, Westminster Embankment, S.W.June 17, 1887Dear Mr. Whitman—I am perfectly delighted with the photograph of thee which has just come, addressed in thy handwriting— & with the date June 1 1887, written on it. How well I remember thee in that big comprehensive chair! It has come as a sort of greeting to my little baby, who will be just two weeks old tomorrow. I held it up for her to look at, but I must truthfully confess that her attention seemed to be more absorbed with her own pink fingers that with the picture! I think Alys or father must have told thee of the baby's birth, I have been hardly able to write before, & am still in bed—but I can't keep sending a note of thanks for thy photograph, & giving thee at the same time a little news about the wee stranger. She weighs the immense amount of nine pounds, & spends her days chiefly in eating, sleeping & being adored. She almost never cries, and she sleeps the whole night through. She is very fat and very pretty, with great blue eyes, & a fascinating little dimple. Alas! I am afraid I cannot hide the self-evident fact that I am very proud of her, and think her the most wonderful baby that was ever born. It is no use struggling against Fate. I meant to be strictly impartial in my judgment of her, but \"C'est plus for que moi\". I think she is a little angel. As for myself—I hope to be up again in a week or so, and quite well and strong. The doctor and nurse say I am making a marvelous recovery—but I do not find it at all hard to imagine physical states of greater bliss than my own. However, the Angel more than makes up for it all.It is a lovely day—the river is shining in the sunlight & the boys are leaping into the water from the barges & splashing merrily about. Little Ray—the baby—lies cooing in her cot, & if I interpret her soft sounds aright she is sending thee her thanks for making her mother so happy by thy gift.Lovingly thy friend,Mary Smith CostelloePlease remember me to Mr. Gilchrist if he is with thee. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe to Walt Whitman, 17 June 1887"
