    "text": "Washington D. C.June 1868My Dear Sir:I am happy to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of April 24th. I appreciate your candor and friendliness and would reciprocate. I believe we agree pretty nearly in theory at least. I can hardly see how two reasonable persons can differ materially on so important a subject as culture, when they come to understand each other, of course we must have culture. We can be nothing without it either as a nation, or as individuals. We do not want Crab apples either in literature, or politics or religion or manners, be the fullest fruit nature can bring forth.I should differ from you perhaps as to the relative importance of artificial culture (culture from books art, society exclusively) to the production of a national literature, and the broader culture of life and of real things. The question with me is not what will conduse[conduce] to the production of scholars or a clan of witty, elegant and accomplished litteratures for these obscure the true ends of literature as the priests pervert religion; but what comparts with grand primary bards upon whom a nation can build, I think of Homers Teachers and of ShakspeareShakespeare and of all monumental everlasting men, and I see how little what is now called culture had to do with what they were or what they achieved.Whether or not we have culture enough in America, it is plain that there is as yet no full fruition of culture here, no triumph of the man frality in our literature over the conventional, and what is worse, is not likely to be.The matter often shapes itself to me in some such formula as this: The first step in culture is marked by a love for, and an acquiescence in, the Artificial; the second step shows a revolt against the artificial as in Byron; the third and last step which not one poet in a century takes, shows no revolt against society, or civilization or art, but an absorption of them and a rising above them. I do not see as any of our own popular poets have ever taken the second step, the step which disturbs and unsettles and presages new things. To me Longfellow, as sweet and gentle a spirit as he is, is no more tonic than confectionery is. Lowell's whip has got a good snapper on it and he knows how to make it crack like a pistol, but is that enough?I think Emerson has taken the last step in man and in religion, but the only modern who has taken it in art according to my judgment, is Walt Whitman. From the standpoint of culture I regard Leaves of Grass as a supreme work. It shows a maturity of the man beyond any other modern poemâ€”the man, done with toys, done with ornaments, done with criticism, and solemnly confronting the terrible beauty and majesty of things.You must allow me the frankness to say that I think you do not understand it. You look into it for what the fact had no design of putting there at least of nothing the main matter, namely genius, specimen's \"five things\" highly wrought intellectual proclaim work &c. It must be understood at the outset that this poem does not enter into competition with other modern works with reference to these things. It differs from them just as the landscape differs from a flower garden. It is absolutely new both in the theory of art upon which it is based and in the such which the poet had in view. This theory of Art I have attempted to suggest in my book. It is briefly this: That nature affords the only adequate standard for a first class modern artist, that to elaborate is of no avail, but to hint, to stimulate to self going, is everything. Nature is perpetual transition. Everything passes & presses on; there is no pause, no completion, no exhaustive elaboration. To produce and multiply endlessly and men of the most liberal and ample culture. To partially cultivated people he is meaningless and repulsive.You are wrong in saying I think the West superior to the East as respects literature or general culture. It would be silly to affirm such a thing. I think the West is prospectively superior to the East. I think a type of character is forming there which will eclipse anything that has yet appeared in the Atlantic States, though that character may be yet a long way off from literature. commit herself to no end or scheme is the law of nature. Something like this is in Leaves of Grass. A hint, a sound, a germ, a stroke, a significant book, and on the author goes, follow who can.I am as little in love with endeavors, and awkward or bungling worksmanship as you are, or with aerid unripe fruit, and any such thing in Walt Whitman would be his instant condemnation to me. Again, I any such charge I set the fact, that his moral heart recognition both in this country and Europe has been from. Neither did I wish to be understood as refering to \"Kathiren\" as a work of true culture. It perhaps represents the average culture of the churches and schools, and its author has doubtless been cultivated fully up to his capacity for culture.I appreciate the need of good nature and hearty cooperation among literary men as much as any one, but we must be aware what price we are paying for them, I think Lessings example as a critic is a good one for young men to emulate, and that soft words are not always the best. The class of poets and critics who aspire to foster and lead public taste in this country are intensely obnoxious to me, because I see they are the sworn enemies of any large generous growth. The great standards and the principles of universal nature need to be revised and enforced at all hazards.With much respect I amYours TrulyJohn BurroughsP. S. Let me call your attention to Whitman's paper on Personalism in the May \"Salary\" which I think contains the deepest layer word ever spoken upon the subject of cultureJ. B.
