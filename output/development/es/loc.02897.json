    "text": "BelmontJuly 1.Dear W.W. The birth of the baby occurred in Fitchburg where Mrs Kennedy has been, at her aunt's, for a month. The child will have to be with relatives, I fear, for a year or so, until I get a settled position. You were partially right in thinking me connected with a large printing establishment. I do do proof-reading for such at times, but have no reg.regular position. I had a $100. job this winter, reading Greek & Hebrew proofs. But my chief reliance is on my pen at present. I am pulling every rope to get into the custom house. In the mean time, calmly, toilingly, ohne hast, ohne rast, working away on my literary chef-d-oeuvre, \"Whitman, the Poet of Humanity,\"â€”here in my idyllic, noiseless home-cottage. Wish I cdcould send you some of the pinks, accept my love instead in return for yours, as something more precious. You renovate & cheerify my ethical nature every time I visit you. WS Kennedy.Take good care of yourself, now, & don't go & have another sun-stroke William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 1 July 1886"
