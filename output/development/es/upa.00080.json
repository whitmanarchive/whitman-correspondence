As it is I can only send best best love & thoughts dwelling with her all the time—I have seriously considered coming to London—but it seems impossible—I am still here—my eyesight is less disturbed, is nearly ab't as formerly—but my walking power worse than ever—they have to half carry me out to the wagon to take the only little exercise I get every day—but my spirits remain cheery & buoyant as ever—I eat and sleep fairly—am so far without any pain of violence—& still have my good & kind housekeeper Mrs. Davis—Have just rec'd the third instalment (31 pounds 19 shillings) of the good English \"offering\" from Wm Rossetti—(some 49 pounds previously,—making 81 pounds or thereabout altogether so far rec'd)—and I can assure you it has been all most acceptable to me—& heart's thanks to you all—I was down yesterday to the Staffords' at Glendale.—O how I wish I could see your dearest mother—again my best, deepest love to her.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist, 30 November 1885"
