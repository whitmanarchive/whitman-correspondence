    "text": "Kirkwood N JMonday evening Feb 18Dear friend, & Bee, Herby & Giddy—I am down here at Kirkwood—Came down here some four days ago—am having a real hearty old-fashioned time, for me—Harry came up for me in the light wagon, the day but one after I was last at your house—a delightful ride down here—& yesterday afternoon one of those nice long rambling drives with George Stafford, in the roomy old light wagon, (a good part of the road through the piney woods, which I always enjoy so much)—The weather has been & is pleasant—a little cool to-day, but the sun shining out as I write—I was down by the creek most of the forenoon—& shall go down for an hour again this evening—bright moonlight nights—I am quite happy here, for me—We live well, keep good wood fires—& have plenty of chicken, eggs & fresh pork (they kill a hog about every two or three weeks)—Mr Stafford is pretty well—he has been out all day with the team hauling marl—Mrs Stafford is well—Harry & the rest ditto—Mrs Stafford thanks you kindly for the medicine—I don't know what day I shall come up—Love to you all—W. W. Walt Whitman to Anne Gilchrist, 18 February [1878]"
