    "text": "Feb: 7. 1872.Dear Mr WhitmanYour letter found me today. This is my permanent address. I live here in a large old house wh. belonged to my father—a house on a hill among trees looking down upon Bristol with its docks & churches—a picturesque labyrinth of masts & spires & houseroofs.Your letter gave me the keenest pleasure I have felt for a long time. I had not exactly expected to hear from you. Yet I felt that if you liked my poem you would write. So I was beginning to dread that I had struck some quite wrong chord—that perhaps I had seemed to you to have arrogantly confounded your own fine thought & pure feeling with the baser metal of my own nature. What you say has reassured me and has solaced me nearly as much as if I had seen the face & touched the hand of you—my Master!For many years I have been attempting to express in verse some of the forms of what in a note to Democratic Vistas (as also in a blade of Calamus) you call \"adhesiveness.\" I have traced passionate friendship through Greece, Rome, the medieval & the modern world, & I have now a large body of poems written but not published. In these I trust the spirit of the Past is faithfully set forth as far as my abilities allow.It was while engaged upon this work (years ago now) that I first read Leaves of Grass. The man who spoke to me from that Book impressed me in in every way most profoundly & unalterably; but especially did I then learn confidently to believe that the Comradeship, wh. I conceived as on a par with the Sexual feeling for depth & strength & purity & capability of all good, was real—not a delusion of distorted passions, a dream of the Past, a scholar's fancy—but a strong & vital bond of man to man.Yet even then how hard I found it—brought up in English feudalism, educated at an aristocratic public School (Harrow) and an over refined University (Oxford)—to winnow from my own emotions & from my conception of the ideal friend, all husks of affectations & aberrations & to be a simple human being. You cannot tell quite how hard this was, & how you helped me.I have pored for continuous hours over the pages of Calamus (as I used to pore over the pages of Plato), longing to hear you speak, burning for a revelation of your more developed meaning, panting to ask—is this what you would indicate?—Are then the free men of your lands really so pure & loving & noble & generous & sincere? Most of all did I desire to hear from you own lip —or from your pen—some story of athletic friendship from wh. to learn the truth. Yet I dared not to address you or dreamed that the thoughts of a student could abide the inevitable shafts of your searching intuition.Shall I ever be permitted to question you & learn from you?What the love of man for man has been in the Past I think I know. What it is now, I know also—alas! What you say it can & shall be I dimly discern in your Poems. But this hardly satisfies me—so desirous am I of learning what you teach. Some day, perhaps—in some form, I know not what, but in your own chosen form—you will tell me more about the Love of Friends! Till then I wait. Meanwhile you have told me more than anyone beside.—I have been led to write too much about myself, presuming on what you said, that you should like to know me better.It will give me sincere pleasure to receive a copy of your book from you. I am grateful to you for purposing to give me so great a gift. Will you complete the benefit by sending me a portrait of yourself?—It is good to hear that your work does not deny you leisure. Work with an ample margin of freedom is the best thing for man; but I cannot believe in the modern Gospel of Work & no leisure. This ends in a Science of Human Mechanics.—When I am free enough from home duties, I hope to be for America, on a tour with my wife. Then I shall request to be permitted to pay respect to you in person.—That you may know my face I enclose 2 portraits. The little girl in one of them is my youngest child.I am your ever grateful & indebtedJohn Addington Symonds John Addington Symonds to Walt Whitman, 7 February 1872"
