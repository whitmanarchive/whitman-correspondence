    "text": "see notes June 18 1888West ParkOct 29. 82Dear Walt.I was much disturbed by your card. I had been thinking of you as probably enjoying these superb autumn days down in the country at Kirkwood, & here you are wretched & sick at home. I trust you are better now. You need a change. I dearly wish that as soon as you are well enough you would come up here & spend a few weeks with us. We could have a good time here in my bark-covered shanty & in knocking about the country. Let me know that you will come.The \"Specimen Days &c\" came all right. I do not like the last part of the title; it brings me up with such a short turn. I have read most of the new matter & like it of course. I have not seen any notices of the book yet. I have just recdreceived an English book—Familiar Studies of men & books—by Stevenson with an essay upon you in it. But it does not amount to much. He has the American vice of smartness & flippancy. I do not think you would care for the piece.I am bank examining nowadays, but shall be free again pretty soon.O'Connor writes me that he is going to pubpublish his Tribune letters in a pamphlet, with some other matter; I am glad to hear it. He draws blood every time.I fear poor old Alcott will not rally; indeed he may be dead now. I had a pleasant letter from him the other day. I had sent him a crate of Concord grapes.I am very stupid to-day. For the past two weeks my head has been ground between the upper & nether millstone of bank ledgers & it is sore. We are all well. Julian is a fine large boy. Drop me a card when you receive this; also write me when you will come up.With much loveJohn Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 29 October 1882"
