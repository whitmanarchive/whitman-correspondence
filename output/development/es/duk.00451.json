    "text": "Burlington Studio Sept 8. 90 Our dear Bro Walt Han is not so well to day—but much cast down. Much disappointed, althought appreciating her friends, Lou and Jessie's visit. She thinks as I do that they should have visited our home first and administered to its immediate urgent necessities—taxes were due 24 dollars—which Han mentioned. On leaving Lou mentioned that Han should write to her, and she would send her all she needed. Now Walt, we need money most taxes—then 1 ton of coal, 1 cord of wood, which Lou promise to pay for—coal 6—wood 4—for a stove which was set up for Han in winter, but for which there is scarcely any use, as I keep a heater all the winter going, pipe trussing upper rooms—. But Han is apprehensive and cast down—dread glooming her 25 years pleasant home. Cannot something, money be raised to relieve us of this present pressure? It seems incredible that I could have sustained ourselves so long, with so little derived professionally. Real estate inducements are advertised in Camden. I have written to the Agents—then Han would be near her family. She often desires to be near you—living near You, Walt. She is cast down. No money was bestowed, our good true friend. Charlie Should you send 5 dolls for me, stick a pin in it for Charlie, home service Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 8 September, 1890"
