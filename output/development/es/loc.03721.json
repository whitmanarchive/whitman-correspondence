    "text": "Camden NJ5th 12th 85Walt Whitman EsqDear Walt:I fear you do not fully appreciate my relations to the Springfield RepubRepublican-people anent the W. W article.There has been a good deal of writing about it, between them & me—and about two weeks ago I sent on a red-hot interview of my own with H W Beecher. Well: they didn't \"bite\" at the HWB-MSS—it was a trifle too warm & cut both ways Blaine-&anti-Blaine but the managing editor quietly says \"We are still waiting for that long-promised article on Walt Whitman\"—I thereupon promised it again within a week, & now they (the Spr. Repub folks) have a right to think I am a d—d, colossal & continental liar (which, en passant, I am not.)Now to the point—I feel bound to get up that article PDQ.And I want you to go at it or let me have my MSS. so I can get it off by next Saturday night. This is fair—& I don't want to keep bothering you about it.I am hard at work at the Law—We all enjoyed your Sunday visit—I wdwould feel much encouraged if I cdcould hear your gray goose quill was pointing toward MassachussettsThine as ever—James M Scovel James M. Scovel to Walt Whitman, 12 May 1885"
