    "text": "West Park N.Y. July 12, 89 Dear Walt, I write you briefly this morning before starting on my 2 week vacation to Delaware Co. I recd the pocket book copy of L.G. & prize it very highly. It is unique. I was very sorry I could not see you on the day you was 70 years old. At that time I was having one of my streaks of insomnia, & was very wretched for two or three weeks. It has worn off & I am feeling much better. The summer has been a very busy one with me. The young grape vines grow so fast that it keeps me going to tie them up to the stakes. I go about all day with two balls of twine at my side, training the young vines in the way they should go, & tying them in that way. I do hope you keep about. I wish some good masculine angel would come & lift you out of Camden, bag & baggage & set you down here, or or by the sea, or in the mountains A change of air now would greatly add to the length of your days. You ought to know this, & I will not bore you with it. I hear from Horace now & then, always gladly. I have not seen O'Connor's reviews of Donnelly's Reviewers. If you have a copy send it to me at Hobart N.Y. & I will return it. With much love John Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 12 July 1889"
