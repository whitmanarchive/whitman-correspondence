    "text": "ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE,Washington,March 4, 1868My dear Mr. Baldwin:I write in reference to a friend of mine, Dr. Charles H. Bowen, of this city, who will soon call upon you personally. He seeks the appointment of Surgeon to the Metropolitan Police here. I have known Dr. Bowen for several years. He was a volunteer U.S. Army surgeon during the war, & was considered one of the best. I can fully join in the same testimony, as he treated, as physician or surgeon, many a case under my own eye, for days & even months. He is a good Union man, of full professional experience, gentlemanly manners, temperate, in the prime of lifeâ€”& I have more than once, when watching his treatment, called him an intuitive physician.I most strongly recommend him as the right man, & one without deficiency in any of the qualifications needed for the place of Police Surgeon.Should you wish it, I will be glad to wait upon you, to testify further regarding Dr. B. I send you, dear sir, my friendliest respects & well wishes,Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to W. O. Baldwin, 4 March 1868"
