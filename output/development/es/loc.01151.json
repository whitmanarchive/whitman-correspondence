    "text": "West Park N.Y.May 18, 85Dear Walt:I have set my house & heart in order for a visit from you before these May days are ended. I trust you are well & really mean to come. Dr Bucke wrote me he should be here early in June to take you with him to Ontario. I want you for 10 days or two weeks before he comes. Can you not come the latter part of this week or early next? If you do not like to make the whole distance alone, I will meet you in Jersey City. Your best train to come by is the one that leaves J.C. a little before 4 p.m. & gets here at West Park at 6.45 The train leaves from the same depot (The Pennsylvania) you come in at.You would enjoy the country here now, & it would add to the length of my days to see you here again.Drop me a line how you feel, & when you will come. Ursula & Julian both want to see you.With much love,John Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 18 May 1885"
