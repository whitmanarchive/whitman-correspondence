    "text": "My Dear Friend Walter,Your very kind and long looked for letter of Aug 1st came to hand on the 6th & I was verry[very] glad to hear from you but was verry[very] sorry to hear that you wer so sick & I think that it would be much better for your health if you would give your self that furlou but I think that the boys about the Hospital could ill spare you, if you are as good to them as you wer to me. I shal never for get you for your kindness to me while I was a suffering so mutch, and if you do not get your reward in this world you will in Heaven.Now I will put in a word for myself my leg still continues to mend verry[very] slow but I hope sure, and I have ben enjoying my self as well as I could with my sore leg I have bin a way on a visit for a week & I have enjoyed my sel[f] verry[very] much (for a wounded soldier is something hear I tell you) for the people wer so kind to me. Walter, we have a good many copperheads hear and some of them are verry[very] rank I can tell you, and I have bin insulted by them twice since I came home, but I manage them verry[very] well, I believe if I was in a battle & see a copperhead & a Reblle I would shoot the copperhead first, and to tell you the truth I am proud of my wound for I think that it is an honor to be wounded in this Cause. If I was able to enlist again, I would willingly do it. But we want first such men as you to stay at home and battle with treason in our midst, for I think that [a] good able Newspaper's correspondent dos a great deal to put down this rebelion & if we all leave home the rebbles will get to bold about home so I think that it is better as it is.Well Walter how mutch I would like to see you out hear it is not near so warm out hear in the country and fruit is a getting ripe. Appels & Pairs & Peaches. & they are so nice to pull them of[f] of the trees them selves.Walter I cannot write any thing that will interest you but I will try and fill up with something. The farmers are most all don Harvisting the crops are all light the wheat mostly was verry[very] thin on the ground but well filled the Oats are verry[very] light hardly worth a cutting (in fact there is a good many that wont cut them at all) the flax is allso short but there will be quite a lot of seed. Corn looks verry[very] promising I dont[don't] remember of ever seeing it look better at this time of year. We have plenty of green corn to eat and it is very nice.My Dear friend I hardly know what to put in this to interest you for I have wrot[wrote] most everything that I can think of so I will give you a discription[description] of My Fathers little place there is about 4 acres in it but the most of it is woodland we have a small stone hous[house] about 18 by 24 ft. it has bin built about 6 years we are a going to build an end to it this fall about the same sise[size] as it is too small, we have a nice little stable. We keep 1 horse and two cows and two hogs we have in a nice little field of corn & we had a nice little field of wheat & a pack of Irish Tralas, Water melons and cantilops[cantaloupes], and every thing that is good & last though not least and a exelant[excellent] spring of watter[water] close to the doorWell I think I will have to fetch my letters to a close and you must not be angry for writing so much foolishness for you know that I am young and foolish all I have to add is my love to you good by and write soon from your ever faithful friend & companion,L. Brown Lewis K. Brown to Walt Whitman, 10 August 1863"
