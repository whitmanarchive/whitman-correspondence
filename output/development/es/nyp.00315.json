    "text": "Thursday, 2 o'clock p. m.Dearest mother,I wrote you a short & very hurried letter last night, only a few minutes before the mail closed— To-day Mrs. O'Connor has just paid me a pleasant visit—& I have been eating my lunch of a roast apple & biscuit—I am feeling about the same—I suppose you are most tired, and perhaps a little suspicious of hearing I am \"about the same\"— Well I am quite tired myself, & want much to get out, & go to work, & go about— But I just have to make the best of it, & console myself with realizing that disagreeable as it is, it might be a great deal worse—& that I am feeling free from pain & comparatively comforting, & that it cannot be very long before I shall have the good use of my limbs again—So I just try to keep patient & wait—& you must too, dearest mother— I got a good letter from Hattie to-day, dated March 9—she says she was writing to you— so I suppose you have one too—They seem to like it at Mr & Mrs. Buckley's. Mother, I got your letter of Monday and Lou's of Sunday—it is an affection of the leg from the knee downward, partially helpless— but the principal trouble is yet in the head, & so easily getting fatigued— my whole body feels heavy, & sometimes my hand—Still, I go out a little every day almost—accompanied by Peter, or some one—sometimes spend an hour out, but cannot walk, except a very little indeed, very slowly indeed— Mother, in my looks you would hardly know the least thing had been the matter with me— I am neither pale nor thin in the least— Friday forenoon March 14. I am sitting here in my room—it is very pleasant out apparently— I generally go out a little between two & three, and shall probably get out a little this afternoon— John Burroughs has been on here again—he is trying to sell or let his house, & does not succeed very satisfactorily—he left here again by the train last evening & returned north—his wife is here—Mother, I send the Harper's Weekly— that picture gives a very good idea of the Capitol, (what they call the east front)— in the Extra is a picture of the inauguration ball—very good, they say—you must look over them Sunday— Well, mother dear, it is now after 12—I expect to get out a little from 2 to 3—Love to you & to Lou & George & all. Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, [13]–14 [March 1873]"
