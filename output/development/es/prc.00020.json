    "text": "WashingtonMarch 9, 1868. Dear Sir:I thank you for the copy of my poems sent by you. It has just reached me. I consider it a beautiful volume. The portrait, as given in it, is, however, a marked blemish. I was thinking, if you wish to have a portrait, you might like to own the original plate of 1855 which I believe I can procure, in good order, & from which you can print a frontispice more creditable—as per impression enclosed. If so, send me word immediately. The price of the plate would probably be $40. gold—or 8 pounds. It would suit just such a volume, & would coincide entirely with the text in note & preface, as they now stand. If I receive your favorable response, I will, if possible, procure the plate, & send it to you by express—on receipt of which, & not before, you can send me the money. (I have sent to New York to see if I can procure the plate, & have not yet received any answer.) I will thank you to convey to Mr. Swinburne my heartiest acknowledgements for the copy of William Blake, (which has reached me)—& for his kind & generous mention of me in it. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to John Camden Hotten, 9 March 1868"
