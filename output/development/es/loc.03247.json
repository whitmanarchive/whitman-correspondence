    "text": "Always FaithfulW.P.MMorgan HallAuburn N. Y.Oct 10th 89O Good Gray Poet,When I read the notes on your life made by Ernest Rhys the tears came to my eyes, and I would have given much to have seen yourself, that I might have knelt before you, & kissed the hands that had ministered so tenderly to wounded men.When I read your writings I get inspiration, I have the feeling of the boundlessness of the universe, of the greatness of a man—perhaps, only perhaps, it may be my glory to help others to \"justify\" your work; it surely is my hearts desire.My excuse for writing you is the sending of a book; a first utterance, called \"Voices & Undertones\"—it bears greeting and admiring love, though it may be a poor messenger to bear the treasure.Some day I hope to hear your voice. God give you peace and perpetual hope!Your unknown friendWm. P. McKenzie William P. McKenzie to Walt Whitman, 10 October 1889"
