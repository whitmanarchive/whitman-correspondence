    "text": "328 Mickle StreetCamden New Jersey U S AmericaSept 14 '87Dear friendI am pretty fair in health &c of late & now—pleasant weather here for several weeks—rainy of late—Y'r nice letter from Switzerland came yesterday—one from your father also just rec'd, enclosing the J A Symonds' note in answer to Swinburne's article—(the article was not worth answering at all—I have not given it a thought)—Dr Bucke has been here for five or six days—leaves to-night—he is well—hearty as ever & much the same—he has (in London Canada) one of the plaster heads, & is quite enthusiastic ab't it—I suppose the one I sent to y'r father has been rec'd before this—I think it had better be donated to the Kensington Museum, if they will accept it & give it a fair place—Morse is still here (in Phila)—is at work on his statuette of President Cleveland—H Gilchrist is here—he is at this moment giving some final touches on his oil painting of me—I like it—Some think it too tame—you will doubtless see it, as G. leaves here (NY) on the 21st on the Germania—Phila is all agog now & for three days to come with the centennial of the Constitution (the idea is good, perhaps sublime, but the carrying out of it more or less tawdry & vulgar)—I am sitting here in the great chair, down stairs—window open—big bunches of flowers on the sill—every thing all right—had toast & a great mug of Whitman's chocolate & hot milk (excellent) for my breakfast—Love to Alys, to the baby, & to all—Walt WhitmanSept. 14, 1887 Walt Whitman to Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, 14 September 1887"
