    "text": "16. October. 1886.Saturday afternoon.12 Well Road HampsteadLondon. England.My dear old Walt:I have been a good deal worried of late. My Publisher—T. Fisher Unwin prepared a contract which does not satisfy lawyers and business men—nor me either when they explained it. Hence delays, insolent letters—in short, matters came to such a pass that I have placed the unsigned draft entirely in the hands of Mr. Ross,—Honorary Secretary of the Incorporated Society of Authors. A first rate fellow, who understands Publishers & their agreements, perhaps as well as any man in England.The upshot of it all will be that either Unwin will sign my agreement as drawn by Ross or I shall part company with my gentleman.The bone of contention is over the change of form: the publisher wishes to reserve to himself the exclusive right of altering the form & price of editions with out taking heed of author's wishes. Though Unwin owns that it is a good book, and that the author is getting very little for it; yet he has the cheek to stand out for this cool proposition—and my advisers (amongst them is one of the ablest lawyers in London) says that this won't do. I am vexed that the final circular is not to hand. I corrected the final revise (the list of names etc:) months ago and posted back to Fraser—the printer. John Fraser (a friend of yours) as I think as I mentioned to you in a previous letter, is doing this for love and not money; therefore I have not been able to hurry him. However I wrote about it a few days ago, asking for some explanation as to such delay. As you know he would not hear of taking any money from me for the first circular relating to free-will-offering— though a journey man printer, I take it or foreman? I don't clearly know his exact position Cope's Tobacco Factory at Liverpool.Your last letter to William M. Rossetti is to be facsimiled as before. Grace is staying at Marley with a friend in Surrey. I expect her back on Monday. I am alone, very much alone and every day I miss my mother more than the last—I only keep things right by incessant work. It will be the spring before I shall be able to get away—the early spring—when if feasible I shall come over to America for a few months: I think that it will do me a world of good.Herbert H Gilchrist How do you spell Count Garossky's name? he died at Washington in Mrs. Ames' house —& was a friend of yours—had an eye poked out in a duel? Herbert Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 16 October 1886"
