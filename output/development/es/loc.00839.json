    "text": "WashingtonFebruary 1 1865Dear Mother,I sent Jeff a letter three or four days ago, which I suppose he received. There is nothing very new with me—I see in the U. S. Senate yesterday they passed a resolution that it was the sense of the Senate that there ought to be an exchange of prisoners. I feel as if there was a fair chance of the box you sent getting to George—I wrote to Jeff how I was so much surer that a box from City Point, would go through, that I had sent a letter to Julius Mason asking him to have a box made up there, & sent, giving him the address, & I or Jeff would pay the bill—if he writes to me that he has done so, I asked him to write if he got mine, I will send him the money myself—Well, mother, how are you getting along—we had a cold week, but the past three days has been much moderated—I am satisfied in the main with my room. I have such a good bed—& my stove does very well—it is a little bit out of the way in location—My work as clerk in the Indian office is quite easy—I am through by 4—I find plenty who know me—I received a week's pay on Monday, came very acceptable—My appetite is not very good, but I feel very well upon the whole—I wish you would ask Wm Fosdick in the corner house for the Times, & also sketch of 51st I lent him, & put them away—I am very glad I have employment (& pay)—I must try to keep it—I send you an envelope, so that you can write me a letter soon as convenient. I send $1 for Nancy, the other for you—I may not write again till about the 12th, or perhaps 10th—Tell Hattie & sis Uncle Walt sent them his love. I see Gen. Butler says the fault of not exchanging the prisoners is not his but Grants.Walt.My room is 468 M street, 2d door west of 12th—from 10 till 4, I am in the Indian Bureau, north-east corner Patent Office, basement. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 1 February 1865"
