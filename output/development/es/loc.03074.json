Thank you for remembering me in so good a letter. I shall see Symonds' book as soon as possible. Shall watch for it in Athenaeum. Having given up general literary contributions myself, too, I have ordered the Critic, Open Court, Camb. Tribune +c stopped. Must look up Critic every week, though. Dr. B. + I will bring out my book on you sometime, perhaps sooner than we any of us know. I wrote fr. London Canada, to Fredk Wilson, peremptorily ordering him to return my MS to me.Do write as often as you can. I have myself absolutely no leisure to speak of, + have acquired a curious distaste for writingâ€”at present.affec'yW S Kennedy William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 6 August 1890"
