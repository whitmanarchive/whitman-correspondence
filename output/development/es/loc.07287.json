    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylum for the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,24 Dec 1888Yours of 21 containing Mrs O'Connor's letter this moment to hand (noon Monday). O'C. has wonderful grit and will make a hard fight yet—We will continue to wish him God speed and ourselves hope for the best. Poor Mrs O'C. too, what noble courage and determination she has! She is as grand as he is, as grand as any. Wm Gurd is here, arrived yesterday without letter or warning, just walked in. All seems to be going on as it should with the meter but slow, slow,—We propose now to make it safe in Canada and western Europe and then proceed to Philadelphia to lay it before experts and capitalists—perhaps establish a Co. to manufacture. I cannot tell how long it may take us yet to get to Phila but I think we ought to be there in the course of January. I trust to find you in good shape then. Nesbit (the other partner) will likely to be here very soon after Xmas we shall then settle on our immediate courseA lovely bright warm day. Would rather however have snow, sleighing and cold at Xmas timeA good Xmas and Love to youR M Buckesee notes 12/26/88 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 24 December 1888"
