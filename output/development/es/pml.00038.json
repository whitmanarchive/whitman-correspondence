Jimmy the Californian on 7th St.  RR Jim Sorrill sends his love & best respects & says he is alive & kicking but the most thing that he dont understand is that young Lady that said you make such a good bed fellow. also Charley Sorrill sends his love & is glad to hear you are doing so well Towers is Very much pleased at your letter & sends his loveHenry Hurt sends his love & is very thankful for the Broadway that you sent him  I saw another game of Base Ball last friday between the Cincinatti & the OlympixOlympic  the game was all one sided  at the end of the game the score stood Olympic, 22 & the Cincinatti 9.
