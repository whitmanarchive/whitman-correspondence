    "text": "Oct 21-1886.48 Rue d'OrselMontmartreMy dear Walt Whitman.Yesterday I gave a letter of introduction to you to a lady friend of mine, Miss Helen Moore. Miss Moore was speaking to me of your poetry yesterday as she and I were walking through the galleries of the Louvre, she is an intellectual lady and she admires a great deal you have written, she enjoyed so much your lecture on the assassination of Lincoln. She leaves Paris for her home in Philadelphia in a few weeks, stopping at London on her way. Miss Moore has just had her first book published, \"Mary Wolstonecraft Shelley\" and I think you would feel that it was well written if you should read it.I feel sure you will find pleasure in Miss Moore's company for she is very appreciative. I was more than pleased to receive the papers you sent me in which I found so much about you. I am sorry I could not have heard the lecture on Lincoln, there is a spirit and movement to your work that I feel directly. I hope you are better and able to get about without trouble. If you can find time and strength to write me even a line I shall be much pleased. There is something about a written word from one that brings more happiness than anything excepting the person himself. Again many thanks for the papers and I trust that the letter of introduction I gave to Miss Moore will be agreeable to you and you will not feel I have taken too much liberty. SincerelyPercy Ives Percy Ives to Walt Whitman, 21 October 1886"
