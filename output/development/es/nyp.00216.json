    "text": "New York,Sept. 10, 1866.Dear Andy, I rec'd your letter last Saturday—I intended to return day after to-morrow, but shall not be able to, till the last of the week, or the early part of next week. The reason is that my book, which is a little more than half done, does not get along as fast as the printers agreed—& if I do not stay & finish it, (the supervision of it,) it will be botched & full of blunders.I am in good health & all goes well. Andy, dear boy, I hope my delay of a few days will not put you out—Write to me, & tell me about the office, & my friends there. Don't forward any letters that come after Friday next, but put them in my drawer. Once more—I send my love to you & all.Walt Walt Whitman to Andrew Kerr, 10 September 1866"
