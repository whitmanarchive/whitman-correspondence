    "text": "Belmont Feb 27 '89 Dear W.W: The German Grashalme rec'd! How honors thicken & cluster. This book is a remarkable step forward. Do you know it gave me a curious (perhaps to you not altogether intelligible) feeling as I read yr familiar poems in the foreign tongue I have so long been reading. I seemed to see to feel you doubled, foreignized, speaking over there the same message to a new nation; & I also imagined this as but the beginning of a long pilgrimage you are to make around the world, uttering yr gospel in the thousand tongues of men. It was a very familiar feeling & something grand & thrilling in its forecast, or phophecy-tinge. I give you here an accurate line for line translation of all of Knortz's and Rolleston's prefaces although I don't deem them worth much (for novelty) except the inevitable biographical summary of Rolleston. The translations are very well done. The German tongue (flexible, many-inflected, wide ranging language) lends itself admirably to yr long sentences. They have translated the very best of the poems for foreign presentation, I think. Do you know anything abt how Rolleston came to be so good a German scholar? Studied in Germany when a boy doubtless? Do you know whether he or Knortz is married? Give my love to Dr. B. You can make any use you want to of the transl. tho' I merely made it for you. WS Kennedy. My Dear W Whitman, Yr letter & papers both rec'd with thanks. I have written lately one of the most elaborate things I ever did—on the nature of poetry—going deep down, canvassing all nature for analogies (Ruskin's five vols of Mod Painters helping me much) going over all the poets, & taking yr Burial Hymn of Lincoln as the model of the poetical style of the future. My article is scientific, I even reverently analyze Shakespeare's technique & prove that he inclined more & more to prose, abandoning rhyme. I show that yr long twenty syllable, & twenty-five syllable lines are the first true heroics ever written in a Germanic tongue and that while rhymes & the lang-tints of verse will continue, you have revolutionized the technique of the drama & the epic. I am cunning on acct of our enemies, & only introduce my great friend—yourself—at the close, when I have cut the other poets to pieces & have interrogated Nature & compared the two—herself & the poets. I had been reserving this piece of work until I moved into my new house. I married a darling little wife six months ago & she & I have built a pretty cottage in Belmont—on the hill magnificent view, at night the illuminated world of Boston twinkling below us—the revolving \"Boston Light\" out—flashing away in the harbor, lime-lights bright & numerous. By day birds and squirrels in the numerous cedars at our door—a perfect forest of Virginia cedars. We have half an acre with trees (wild) & are in complete solitude in our eyrie, no neighbors within sight, except through the trees. Is not this tempting? And now does it not tempt you to come and see me? Let me beg of you if you come to Boston, to let me know at once, & I will escort you out, & instalinstall you in our prophet's chamber, where there is a fireplace, & a great prospect, with deserted woodland walks right at hand. Will you promise? Write & tell me. Mrs K. goes in to the city every day, so we shd have the day to ourselves, I also go in nearly every day, & you cd have the house to yourself much of the time. Do come & stay two weeks if you can. We have no girl (servant) to bore us. I am a little nobody, but I reverence you, & that sheds a little borrowed greatness on me. I sent my article on poetry to the Century. They ordered an article on E.E. Hale, wh. I have sent also. I have a splendid plum for you in that. Hale wrote an appreciative review of yr first book in '56 also in the North American & he told me that he thought he shd stand by every word of it to-day, but that's nothing, after all. aff.W.S. Kennedy. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 27 February 1889"
