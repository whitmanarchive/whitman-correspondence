    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeAsylum for the InsaneOntarioLondon, Ont.,16 Jan 1890At the house we are getting better. Am feeling considerably better myself. W.J. Gurd and all the rest are also mending. But at the asylum it is doubtful if we have yet seen the worst of this infernal La Grippe. A large number of the offices and attendants are more or less sick with it so that it is all we can do to get through the daily necessary work. Has it come your way yet? I do not see any accounts in the papers of the epidemic in Philadelphia and Camden. If you get it you will probably be pretty miserable for a few days but it is not likely it will do you any more harm than thatIt is wintry today, ground white (though no sleighing) and air frosty. I am pretty well through with my days work (it is 4 P.M.) and after making this short report to you shall read L. of G. for a lttle while and then go to the house.Perhaps you have a touch of La Grippe for I have not heard from you for quite a long time (your last note was written 9 days ago, viz: on 7th)Tell me how you areYour friendR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 16 January 1890"
