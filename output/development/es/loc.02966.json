    "text": "BelmontTues Eve. Jan 29: 89Thank you for yr good letter. I appreciate such answering (& you all, too). I agree with you that Sarrazin article (and I take him to be a young or middle-aged man) is powerful. It took me several days to absorb it and make my extracts &c. The man got such a grip on his subject, had it all at his fingers' understands you & loves you. This is as it shd be—We need such apostles in Europe; and more will be sure to appear. I notice in the Nuova Antologia author Italian, le hizrine; yours, as being familiar with L. of G. I am re-reading Robert Browning a little.I am anxious abt that health of yrs, yet thankful it is no worse. Dont you think you are sometimes a little cold and repressive? When I visit you I suppose you that: \"well here's another spier & critic & drea in yr horus. I wait yr personal love; the book I write chiefly to gain that if it euds to make hearty sympathy impossible I wd rather pitch it into the sea. (I fear my digestion must be poor to-night judging from the of the foregoing!) Had a card for Rhys lately.—yes I too think T W. Wilson was scared by Gardner. We shall see. I keep toiling away kicking my MS into shape, adding touches &c &cW S Kennedy William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 29 January 1889"
