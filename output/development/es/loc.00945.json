    "text": "Providence. R.I.July 24 1864. Sunday.Dear Walt,I was at the Boat at 2 Wednesday afternoon and we sailed at 5. I hoped to see you, but feared you would not be able to go over. I was all the more sorry not to see you, and I inferred from it that you were too unwell to come over. Mr. Conway, Martin, F. went to the boat with me & remained an hour or so. Mr. Howells having business here, made his arrangements to come that evening, so I had company, but I had hoped for a good long talk with you, & hoped that you would be able to go over to the boat.How are you now, dear Walt?I long to hear from you. William & Charlie had each had two letters from you, & I not a word, don't you know that I shall be jealous? and now this is my third epistle to you, so I shall claim a word from you when you are able to write.My sister & Dr. Channing both ask for you with the greatest interest, & Jeannie, Mrs. C. says she should have written you at once and asked you there when I first wrote her that you were ill, if she had not been sick herself.Should you write me, direct to me Care of Dr. Wm. F. Channing. Providence. R.I. I am still in pursuit of a place at the sea - shall, & hope to find one, for I need the sea.I want to hear from you, dear Walt, & I hope you are gaining all the time, are you?With love -Yours,Nelly. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 24 July 1864"
