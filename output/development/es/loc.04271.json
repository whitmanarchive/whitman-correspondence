    "text": "fm Horace Tarr86 LIBERTY STREET,NEW YORK CITY.Dec. 1, 1890.My Dear Mr. Whitman:â€”Since Jeff's death I have been constantly thinking that there should be some proper obituary notice of him published in one of the engineering journals.At the time of the death of Moses Lane, I found that the notices which I wrote brought forth others from his friends, and withal it was very satisfactory to his family and those to whom he was especially dear.In Jeff's case, there is no one of us that knows enough of his early life to write a proper notice, in fact, there is no one that can do this with justice to his memory among us, save possibly Worthen, or Joe Davis, and we cannot hope for anything from them. Therefore, the thought has occurred to me that if you would write a notice that would take up say not over half a column Publisher says you may take a whole column, (as it is very difficult, you know, in one of these engineering journals, to get more than this), if you would do this, I would attend to having it published in one of the engineering journals, and I know that it would be a very great satisfaction to his friends in the profession.The death of Jeff has been a very great blow to me personally, as for a good many years I looked upon him as one of my warmest friends. Our association of the last four or five years has been constant, and very close, and I have learned to lean upon him in so many ways that I feel as though a prop were taken out of my life by his deathI am sorry to have to write you a machine letter now, but my crippled arm makes this a necessity.If you agree with me, and are willing and strong enough to furnish me the manuscript, I would suggest your doing it at once, as I shall be away from home after a few days, and besides that, it should be published as soon as possible.Very truly yours,Horace Tarr Horace Tarr to Walt Whitman, 1 December 1890"
