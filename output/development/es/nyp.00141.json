    "text": "Mr. Whitman Dear SirI will now improve a few moments to pen you a few lines in accordance to your request.I left Washington last Monday at 3 oclock in the afternoon and arrived in Baltimore at 5 Oclock and I then reached this Citty[City] and took the cars again at 9 Oclock and arrived here in Williamsport the next morning at 10 oclock.I had a very pleasant passage and enjoyed the ride very much but yet I found that my wounds were somewhat situated and they have been more sore than usual and so I have not gone about the place a great deal yet, but what I have seen so far I think I like the place very much.The Business is chiefly lumbering and it is carried on in a more extensive manner than I have ever before seen it and the place is fast building up and will very soon be incorporated into a citty[city].I like the place very much what I have seen of it yet I have not been about but a little and I cannot write you so much as I would like to and so I will write you again. I want to hear from Washington and how things are moving and will be much pleased to hear from you and I will try to write you more in my next letter.I remain yours truly, Alvah H. Small to Walt Whitman, 24 July 1863"
