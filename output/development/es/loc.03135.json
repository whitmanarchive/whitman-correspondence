Thanks to you—& thanks & best remembrances to your wife—for the kind invitation in it. I shall probably accept it for a few days, as I want to visit Washington soon as I am well enough. I should have made my visit the current week, but one of my bad spells has intervened—will write to you before I come—I still linger along here in the same tedious baffling way—still hope to get well—but still don't get well. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Joseph B. Marvin, 15 October [1874]"
