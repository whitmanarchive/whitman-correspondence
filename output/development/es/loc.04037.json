My love to Ed and Debby and the whole family.)As I am going up & may not be down again soon, I wish Debby to take charge of my big pillow, as it was made by & given me by my mother, & she slept on it & I shall want it again. I may want the stove, to use, this winter, but don't know. The bedstead I give to Debbie if she will accept itâ€”it an't worth much any how. Walt Whitman to Susan Stafford, [December(?) 1878]"
