    "text": "BlaenavonRoutzpoolEngland.Mon: Jan. 18,/76.My dearest Friend,Do not think me too wilful or headstrong but I have taken our tickets & we shall sail Aug 30, for Philadelphia. I found if I did not come to a decision now, we could not well arrange it before next summer. And since we have come to a decision my mind has been quite at rest. Do not feel any anxiety or misgivings about us. I have a clear and strong conviction I am doing what is right & best for us all.—After a busy anxious time I am having a week or two, rest with Percy, who I find fairly well in health & prospering in his business—indeed he bids fair to have a large private practice as an analyst here, & is already making income enough to marry on only there is to build the nest—& I think he will have actually to build it, for there seem no eligible houses— & to furnish that the wedding will not be till next spring or early summer—nevertheless with a definite goal & a definite time & the way between not so very rugged though rather dull & lonely I think he will be pretty cheery. This little town (of 11000 inhabitants all miners, smelters &c.) lies up among the hill 1100 ft above the sea—glorious hills here spreading then converging, with wooded flanks & swift brooklets leaping over stones in the hollows—the air too of course deliciously light & pure.—I have heard through a friend of ours of Bee's fellow students who lives in Camden (Mr. Suerkrop I think his name is) that we shall be able to get a very comfortable home with pleasant garden there for about £55 per an: I think I can manage that very well—so all I need is to hear of a comfortable lodging or boarding house (the former preferred,) where we can be, avoiding hotel even while we hunt for the house. I have arranged for my goods to sail a week later than we do, so as to give us time. Good bye for a short while my dearest FriendAnne Gilchrist. Bee has obtained a very satisfactory account of the Womens[Women's] Medical College in Philadelphia & introductions to the Head, &c. Anne Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 18 January 1876"
