    "text": "131 West 22nd St.New YorkSunday 11/3/88My dear Mr. Whitman:You will remember my calling a few weeks back when I remember that I do so as a friend of Earl Russell's & I much regret that before leaving Phila I could not get over to say good-bye, but I was called on business to New York & so could not help it. I take the Herald in here pretty regularly & am always delighted at the lines I find of yours there & I trust you will long continue to rejoice our hearts with that that is so beautiful and good in Nature.I am as you knowWellesley Sayle an Englishman & am proud to be one of many thousands of my fellow countrymen who have received so much good cheer from your writingsI am about to ask a favor from you, thinking that it is perhaps in your power to render it. I am anxious to make the acquaintance of Col Robert Ingersoll, a man whom I much admire for his outspoken attitude & I wish to ask if you can give me a letter of introduction to him.I shall be greatly obliged if you can. I trust I am not asking what is out of your power to give.Again a great lady friend of mine & a great admirer of yours has asked me if possible to get your autograph, & so, I have taken the liberty of asking this double favor. I am about to go next door. I shall most likely call at Phila on my way where I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you again. With best wishes for your health & happinessI am,Your grateful fellow travellor & friendWellesley Sayle Wellesley Sayle to Walt Whitman, 3 November 1888"
