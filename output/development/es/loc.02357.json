    "text": "3 Pauntry RoadLavender Hill. SW.London. EnglandOctober 16th '90My dear SirThe only excuse that I can offer for trespassing upon your privacy + your time, is the great admiration I hold both for your name + your worksI am having printed a volume of verses, and as I wish to show—though inadequately I know—my gratitude to the illustrious author of 'Leaves of Grass' I am writing to beg your acceptance of the dedication. I am quite aware that my work at its best, can be but an unfitting sequence to your name, but my tribute is not the less sincere.The volume is to be quite a slender one, + to consist for the most part of pieces which have appeared from time to time in English periodicals. I would have enclosed proof sheets—to enable you to judge of their merit, but I have not received any from the printer yet + I do not wish to delay publication longer than necessary.Believe meYours very trulyRoger E. IngpenWalt Whitman Esq Robert Ingpen to Walt Whitman, 16 October 1890"
