    "text": "45. Wall StreetNew YorkJune 16. 90.My dear Whitman,Accept my best thanks for the beautiful copy of \"Leaves of Grass.\"—What I love about that book is that it is filled with the spirit of freedom. Every line is manly, natural, independent, self poised, and in each is a superb personality. You have given the world the harvest of a great Grain. You have stood straight, erect, and have kept your hat on. There is no dust on your knees. I have taken the liberty to send you a copy of the last edition of Prose Poems. The title was given to the collection by my friend the publisher. So you will not hold me responsible for that. I think that you will like the articles on —Art and Morality—life, and the . Of course you may not agree with all I say, but you have that splendid thing—\"Intellectual Hospitality\"—and that is enough.Again, thanking you for the splendid Book wishing you many, many happy years—laurel-crowned—I remain, yours alwaysR. G. Ingersollletter f'm R G Ingersoll June 16 1890 Robert Ingersoll to Walt Whitman, 16 June 1890"
