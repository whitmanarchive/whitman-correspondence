    "text": "WashingtonApril 21, 1871.Dear Abby,I have seen Major Saxton, & handed him your note, & the accompanying paper—he said he knew the 4th Auditor personally, & would see him about it, & would probably write to you within three or four days. So Arthur is home, & you are all well—what with the baby & all you women—what jolly times you must have—I wish I could just drop in and take part in them—With me, nothing very new or special—I am well & hearty—feel first-rate the greater part of the time—and as to streaks of the other kind of feeling, I am thankful they are so few—for you know I am getting to be an old fellow—though my temperament for buoyancy & fun I believe increases instead of diminishes—I shall take my vacation considerably earlier than usual, this summer—so it wont be long before I shall see you all.Love to all—not forgetting the baby.Walt.Abby, Willard Saxton's address is 1st Comptroler's office Treasury Dep't. Walt Whitman to Abby H. Price, 21 April 1871"
