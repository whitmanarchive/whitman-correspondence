    "text": "St. Louis,Aug 2nd 1867Dear WaltYours duly received  I have had so many things to attend to lately that I have not been able to get time to answer and can only do so now so that you may know that I hav'nt[haven't] forgotten youWe are still at work getting out specifications for the settling Reservoirs—a job of about $700 000—and of course we feel mighty anxious to cover all points so that we wont be upset by any sharp practiceOn the street to-day I saw a very interesting yet somewhat painful sight—twas that of a family moving in from the plains—An old woman—I shoud[should] judge all of eighty—another woman of about 35—a young man and his wife abtabout 25 a boy of 12 two children 8 and 6 and a little babe—all but the young man and his wife were in the wagon drawn by 4 oxen—the wagon covered with dirty white canvass—The boy had leading with a rope a fine old cow—a young cow and calf were alongside—under the wagon was a large white dog and inside by the old woman was a small black terrier—They had met with an accident in the way of b[r]eaking one of the hind wheels and were therefore hard up—The faces of all were a study—but particularly of the young man and his wife—neither of them was at all handsome but yet I shall remember their faces for a long time—The old woman had that peculiar look of crazy stupidity that you can hardly tell whether they are really stupid or thinking of by-gone life  The talk of the crowd was that they had been driven in by the Indians—but I doubt that part of the story—There is a report in town to-day that some of the \"bloody injunsIndians\" were stealing cows &c just outside town—about where we propose to set our pumping engines—Of course I suppose its all humbug—but yet cannot see what such a detailed statement as is in the paper this morning is printed for— I had a letter from Mother a few days ago—she appears to be getting along middling well yet I wish she could get a better place to live— From a letter received from Mat to-day she is having a first rate time yet—I wish you would write her—address care of G. F. Mason, Towanda, Give my regards to Mr & Mrs O'Conner and friends that I met in Washington—I hope you may be able to carry out your idea and come out to see us—good by for the present  write me as often as you canJeff Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 2 August 1867"
