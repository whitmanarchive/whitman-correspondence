    "text": "431 Stevens st. Camden, N. Jersey, U. S. America. April 25, 1874. Rudolf SchmidtDear friend—Yours of April 4 has come to hand—with picture, which I prize—you speak of Mr. Elster's criticism—when it comes I shall have it carefully translated to me—if you communicate with him, please give him my serious thanks & good will—All your papers, copies of D. Fremblik & your letters have reached me safely in the past—(also the large photo. by poor Clausen.) Did you receive Redwood Tree in Harper's Magazine—& Prayer of Columbus—sent some weeks (March 4) since? This piece of C. Petersen is in the May Galaxy, a New York Monthly. I will make inquiry about Petersen, & if I see him or find out I will duly write you. I am not well yet—far from it—but live in hopes—Walt WhitmanJohn Burroughs visited me for two days lately—He is well, is married, (36 years old), has left Washington, & has settled on a little farm with horse, cows, & fowls on the banks of the Hudson river, 60 miles from New York, his native state & mine. I am to go there the coming summer. J. B. is a most natural, homely, good man—(like an apple–tree, or pine, or a good field of wheat—yet thoroughly human)—has a nice wife, kind & good to me, like a sister. To–dayToday is dark & rainy here—spring very backward here—I sit here in the room alone, writing this—I am much alone—W. W. Walt Whitman to Rudolf Schmidt, 25 April 1874"
