I heard too from Traubel and Harned. Harned enclosed a mem. from Donaldson. All seems to be going well around you, I wish all was going as well with you—as indeed probably it is, although I fear in the meanwhile you are uncomfortable, even suffering. Would it not be as well, Walt, to sell the horse—Harned would attend to it—it will be just as cheap to hire by & by when you want to go out—if that time comes. As the matter stands the horse is eating her head off and taking harm from want of exercise.I am sorry to hear that Baker is about to leave you but perhaps the next man will be as good. I am glad to think you are well enough to get on without a regular nurse but however well you get you must always henceforth have a man to help & take care of youYour friendR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 11 July 1888"
