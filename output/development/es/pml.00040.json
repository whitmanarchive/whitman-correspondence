    "text": "Camden, Sept.September 9.Abby,your letter has come, & is welcome. Dear Abby, & dear friends all, the doctors say I will get well, & I say so too—but which ever way it goes, it will be all right—the little Philadelphia paper piece was about the right statement of my case from a favorable point of view—I shall remain here for the present—I get around middling well—the worst is bad spells in the head which persistently return—if I get a little better I may like to come on & pay you a visit—upstairs will do just as well for me, as I get up & down better than you would think. I will write to you beforehand should I come. My brother Jeff has come on from St. Louis for a while—stoptstopped here yesterday though only a few hours—has gone on to N.Y. to a good sailing excursion, a week on a yacht voyage—I told him to call on you, if possible—& he will if he can work it—My brother & sister here are well as usual—Eddy the same—Helen, if you see Miss Hillard tell her I rec'dreceived her letter & thank her for it—I have not felt to write to her, or any one but my sisters, about mother's death—the great dark cloud of my life—the only staggering, staying blow & trouble I have had—but unspeakable—my physical sickness, bad as it is, is nothing to it— Walt Whitman to Abby H. Price, 9 September [1873]"
