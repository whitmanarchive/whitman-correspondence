    "text": "Anderton, nrnear ChorleyLancashire, England5th Septbr 1890Dear Walt Whitman,It is impossible for me to write much now, but I want to get a letter off by this mail in acknowledgement of your very kind post card to hand this morning.—Thanks to you indeed!Yes! I received your portrait \"in good order\"—and with emotions which I have already tried to indicate.—Apart from its existencea photo: the last taken half length like the one you have value to me as a gift from yourself, I find its intrinsic merit very great indeed.—It has \"grown\" upon me very much, and authenticates itself, to my mind, more and more, as a true characteristic portrait. Indeed, I am delighted with it. (Certainly, far better than the \"Illustrated News\" one!)I wished to carry out your instructions literally, + to put it in place of the other in the same frame.—But it did not fit quite satisfactorily so I decided to have a new frame made like the old one (plain oak 3\" wide) and to use the old frame for something else.Dr Johnston, too, has had the portrait you gave him (of yourself—painted by Sidney Morse) framed, (gold mat + frame) and is very pleased with itHe called on me at noon today + I shewed him your post card. He is deeply sensible of your great loving-kindness + your solicitude about him. He has improved in health since his return, + is, I think, very well now.He kindly brought me, as a present, the two vols. of \"Essays\" by J. A. Symonds which I have not yet read. I have glanced them over + find much to stir my appetite.But I must not write more now.With the deepest love gratitude + reverence to you always, Dr. Johnston joining meI remainYours affectionatelyJ. W. Wallace J.W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 5 September 1890"
