I.Dresden, GermanyDear Sir.Through the kindness of one who I am proud to call a friend, and a Countryman of mine, I have an opportunity of writing to you, whose sentiments I agree with and whose works I admire. Mr. Rolleston and a Mr. Wilkins, two students of Trinity College, Dublin, were the first to draw my attention to your poetical works, of which I wish to say a few words. I am an ardent student of the Russian Language, and greatly interested in the huge country and its strange people and history. Your book is the book for them. Will you allow me to translate the \"Leaves of Grass\" into Russian. It will do good, of that I am perfectly sure. I know the Russian character, and say again that the \"Leaves of Grass\" is the book for them. Awaiting the favour of a replyI am, dear Sir,Your sincerely,J. Fitzgerald Lee John Fitzgerald Lee to Walt Whitman, 28 November 1881"
