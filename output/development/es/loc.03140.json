    "text": "N.Y.Ap. 16. 76My dear Walt Whitman:I met a mutual friend last evening who informed me he had just procured your books from you by mail. And I directed him, since he had been so fortunate and understood how to do it, to write at once for me and have the books sent to the Windsor Hotel.Well I am not living at the Windsor, and in fact have no fixed abode. Besides I want your name written in the books if not asking to[too] much for so little. And so on reflection I have decided to write you for when you receive my order through Mr. Johnson, you will please write in the books, saying they are from you to me, and then lay them to one side and I will call and get them next month. For when the Centennial opens I want to bring you some friends who are so anxious to visit the good old the great gray Poet. Thine.Joaquin MillerP.S. Of course it is idle for me to congratulate you on your accession to immortality and your well deserved renown. I will only say that my Soul and my sympathy all go out toward you and I often think of you as the one lone tree that tops us all, battered by storm once blown but still holding your plume, serene and satisfied. Hoping to see you early in May goodbye and the gods be with you. Joaquin Joaquin Miller to Walt Whitman, 16 April 1876"
