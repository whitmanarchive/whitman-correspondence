I have been over the proofs and enclose some requiring corrections if these can still be made (or perhaps you have already made them). I like the book better and better, think it will doâ€”As soon as you are able to fix date of publication let me know. I am up to my eyes in workR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 9 May 1883"
