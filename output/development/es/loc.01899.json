    "text": "My dear Walt Whitman,We are so sorry to hear you are so ill, & we long to help you. You have done so much for us, your \"Leaves of Grass\" have been a real Bible to us, full of hope for our poor human race & especially for the help you have given to our half of humanity, namely the Women. It is about 3 years now since we found you, & you have been a dear & cherished friend since, at first secretly because of the Jews but we can dare to speak now more freely of our prophet.It is so painful to us to hear of so dear a friend being in trouble, we sh like to go over & nurse you, but we cannot, one of us is busy with professional engagements; & the other can not leave her mother. We are sending this to your friend & champion Rosetti[Rossetti] as we do not know your address. Dear Walt Whitman pray accept the warmest sympathy from two grateful Scotch Women.Thérèse C. Simpson & Elizabeth J. Scott Moncrieff1 Alva St. Edinburgh.March 30th/76. I once wrote to you before, but I fear you may not have got the letter—it was about Xmas, 2 years ago. T. C. S. Thérèse C. Simpson and Elizabeth J. Scott Moncrieff to Walt Whitman, 30 March 1876"
