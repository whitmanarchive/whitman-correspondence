    "text": "see notes Feb 8 1889'83Nov. 22nd28 Terrassen UferTerrassenufer Dresden.My dear friend and master—I am at last able to send you the lecture, which I have now got published together with another by a friend of mine here, delivered before the same society. I hope it may do something, however little, towards making the L. of G.Leaves of Grass known here. If any American bookseller would like it, which is not, I suppose, very probable, he must write to the publisher, Tittman. We are selling it for 1 mark, which = I think a quarter of a dollar, about. I have sent a copy to Dr Bucke. Would you kindly transmit one to W. O'Connor? whose address I don't know. As to Dr Knortz, I fear it would be quite impossible to carry on the work of translation with him at such a distance. I have appended to my lecture a transl.translation of the Song of the Answerer, & in getting this translation into final form, I was astonished at the amount of discussion it gave rise to, between myself & a German friend who looked over my proofs, showing that it would be quite impossible to carry on the work of translation with another person across the Atlantic. Besides I greatly doubt if he would go into it. His admiration for the L. of G.Leaves of Grass is decidedly qualified by objection to your system of punctuation, use of participles, &c., which matters seem to bother him more than they ought. His translations are sympathetic & effective for the poetic passages—but when he converts a word whose meaning is a little remote or unusual, he evades the difficulty. For instance, here is his rendering of a passage from the Mystic Trumpeter (st. 5).—Blow again, Trumpeter! Take for thy themeThe All-encloser, the Redeemer and Orderer—Love, pulse of the All, of sorrows & of joys,The heart of man and woman;No other theme than love—immortalizing, all-embracing, self-surrendering Love.On the whole I begin to fear that a complete translation is not feasible, at present. But I might possibly reckon on assistance enough to produce good renderings of, say, 8 or ten of the longer poems, which might then be published in a small book—& perhaps pave the way for something more: What would you think of this?I am sending McKay a copy of the lectures & am asking him that we have a copy of the L. of G.Leaves of Grass with broad margins, if he has got one. The 1882 reprint is not very satisfactory in this way to me at least, as I like to make notes & references in the book.Things are going badly in Ireland. The GovtGovernment is putting down meetings (of the National party) right & left, for no reason, & the people are getting very exasperated. I had hoped great things from Gladstone's government, but that accursed Egyptian war opened my eyes finally to the mixture of hypocrisy & injustice which lie at the root of English policy. If you could only live in Ireland for a while, & see this sensitive, keen sighted, but helpless nation dragged about in the clumsy lurches of English Opportunism—seeing it all, knowing its own mind & ideal but condemned to incapacity for realizing it,—you would wish us God speed. And yet I did not always see my way to these views myself. Now I must close—I was very glad to hear of your health & pleasant circumstances, &c. in your last letter. May this one find it all unchanged.Yours alwaysTW Rolleston. Thomas W. H. Rolleston to Walt Whitman, 22 November [1883]"
