    "text": "Insane AsylumLondon OntarioLondon,11 Nov 1890Yours of 8th came to hand yesterday while I was giving my third (two hour) lecture—the lecture was on mania. I have a class of over twenty students—I see that miserable grip still sticks to you—has Thomas been over yet abt. the glasses and have you got them? I am exceedingly anxious to know whether or no this uncomfortable feeling is at all relieved by such good glasses as he will order you—Did they make a good job of the old hat?All is well here—the meter coming on but slow, slow—but we are not depending on it to have a pretty good time—That is a good report about L. of G. in England—but I have known it all along—it must come nothing can stop it—it is the book of the future for the next few hundredyears—We are all well pleased here too over the result of your elections, we hope (many of us do) that it is the beginning of the return to sanity and to a broad continental view of politics—or is this too much to hope? If we could only get union of this continent I think the (political) future of the world would be assuredMy love to youRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 11 November 1890"
