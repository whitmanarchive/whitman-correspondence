    "text": "see notes July 29 1888 | Also Aug 1Willards HotelWashingtonJune 30/85Dear Walt Whitman: I intended to call over & see you yesterday when I was in Philadelphia, but I was unexpectedly detained by one man and forced to go to Washington so as to reach here last night. I will call on you on my way back to New York. But I write now to tell you why, because my visit will be on business I believe you have never met Mr Rice, proprietor of the North American Review, altho'although nominaly[nominally] he may have corresponded with you—that is, his office Editor may have written to you in his name, as he always does, even when Mr Rice is in Europe. It is at Mr Rice's instance that I will call on you. He has conceived the plan of procuring a collection of papers that, united in one volume, will be a permanent memorial of Lincoln. He has set about to secure the Reminiscences of all the eminent Americans who came into personal relations with him—each man to tell his story, whether it shall be short or long. That's what he calls his Lincoln Series. Some of these papers he may publish in the North American Review, & others in the North American Review Syndicate: a group of influential papers which he supplies & that publish simultaneously articles from famous men whom ordinarily newspapers cannot reach—nor afford to pay separately even if they did reach them. All the articles that you see marked \"Copyright\" in the New York Tribune or Phil.Philadelphia Times (Sunday editions) are supplied by Mr Rice. Next: he intends to secure a series of papers giving the civil history of the civil war—legislation, &c. He wants me to see you & ask you to write a paper on your experiences of the Civil War—the hospital life, & other phases that you witnessed & have not yet described. Could you write an article giving your recollections of Lincoln and also your memories of the War? Short or long it will be gladly accepted & liberaly[liberally] paid for. He will take it, whether it is a page or a hundred pages I shall be here a week. I suppose I shall have no difficulty in finding the good grey poet in Camden. Ever truly yours,James Redpath. James Redpath to Walt Whitman, 30 June 1885"
