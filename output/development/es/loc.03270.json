    "text": "THOS. J. MCKEELaw Offices, 338 Broome St., cor. Bowery,Mechanics' & Traders' Bank Building.New York,April 7th 1888. 188Mr. WALT WHITMAN;Dear Sir:I received your letter but had been looking into the matter for some days previously, Dr. Bucke and Mr. Johnston having spoken to me about your claim against Worthingon. The difficulty I find is[in] this that R.Worthington[R. Worthington] failed some time since and is now unable to do business in his own name, and the business is now run by a corporation named the Worthington Co. of which Worthington's wife or some female relative is the President. The time within which to claim a forfeiture of the plates and books (two years) has run out and we are therefore limited to our action for an injunction and damages, I am therefore quietly trying to get all the facts I can as to what the \"Worthington Co.\" has been doing with reference to your book. The Company is of some responsibility and undoubtedly have possession of the plates.As soon as I have facts sufficient to base a sure claim I will get the injunction and money.Yours sincerelyT. J. McKee Thomas J. McKee to Walt Whitman, 7 April 1888"
