Sawyer on Saturday he is well and sens his love to you. he has bin in that Gettysburg Battle. he sais[says] that it was awful, and that he never wants to see the like of it againMy health is verry[very] good, and my leg dos still continue's[continues] to mend slowlyâ€”but verry[very] slow, the Doctor has took out three little pieces of bone out of it since I came home.I am enjoying my self as well as I can with my four legs but I cannot go about much yet I am a going out a carriage riding tomorrow if it dos not rain I do not know how I will stand it for it hurt me more riding from the Depot home than it did all the way in the cars.I will be back to the hospital about the last of August. I would like to be thear[there] in time to see the boys present Doctor Bliss with that Case of instruments on the 23 of August, that will be my anaversary[anniversary] it will be just a year since I came to that hospital on that day so I think I will have to hurry back to see it. The farmers have got pretty near don Harvisting[Harvesting] and the crops are pretty good without it is grass and it is light and thear[there] was so mutch[much] wet weather that some of that was spoilt. No more at present but good by and write soon with my love to you and all enquiring friends, I remain your sincear[sincere] friend Lewis K. Brown. Direct your letter to Lewis K. Brown Elkton, Cecil Country, (Md). paper is scarce so I will have to close good by and God bless you. Lewis K. Brown to Walt Whitman, 27 July 1863"
