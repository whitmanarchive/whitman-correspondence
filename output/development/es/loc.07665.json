    "text": "CamdenP M Feb: 11 '89Much the same subject continued. I am still confined to the room & chair—eat & drink moderately—my meals mostly mutton-broth with bits of the well-stew'd meat & Graham bread & sometimes roasted apples or a cup custard—appetite fair—of course monotonous here (it is getting to be the ninth month)—but I am comparatively comfortable & get along better than you w'd suppose—snowing to-day, half-melting when it falls—You got the printed slips of the Sarrazin tran[slation] I sent?—Dr B[ucke] has the magazine—he has been forced to delay his jaunt this way—& now names the 18th inst. to start hither—he may go directly to Wash'n to see O'C[onnor]—with a possibility of it being further put off—O'Connor is badly off—worse—& I am much worried ab't him—he is laid up, mainly bed fast, in his house—very bad, at my last acc'ts four days since, from Mrs O'C—I hear that the German (partial) tran: is advertised in the German papers—so we will soon get the book here—& I will send you one when I get some—Pray you don't mind any little proof lapses in the S. trans: (if any)—it is a wonderfully consoling piece to me—coming from so evidently a fully equipt, sharp-eyed, sharp-nosed, sharp-ear'd Parisian Frenchman—running the critical leads the very deepest—& here what he reports—I have rec'd a good long warm flattering letter from Addington Symonds from Switzerland with a large photo head—the best photo I ever saw—Best loveWalt Whitman Walt Whitman to William Sloane Kennedy, 11 February 1889"
