    "text": "see notes Feb 11 1889Washington, D.C.December 10, 1886.Dear WaltIt has been a great trouble to me not to be able to write to you. The difficulty of managing pen and ink is indescribable, and only equalled by the difficulty of putting even the simplest expressions together. I begin to fear that paralysis is not far off. I move about with slowness and difficulty. But worst of all is the horrible deadness of the mind. I put in an appearance every day at the office, but it is a long time since I have been able to do anything.I got two postal cards from you in August, and recently yours of the 19th ultimo. It saddens me to know of your condition, and I wish it could be otherwise.You mention having got a German paper (in August) with a long notice of L. of G. Did you see a pamphlet by Dr. Karl Knortz—a lecture about you delivered in New York to a large audience, I heard with great applause? He sent me a copy, and I undertook to get it translated, but the young lady I trusted hung fire when just near the close, and I have not got the translation quite yet! I hope to have it before long. A German friend who glanced over the article, told me the language was very powerful.You remember the article from the Nation in review of the New Zealand professor's book about you. Since then Charley Eldridge has sent me the book, which I will forward to you, if you would like to see it. It is remarkable and good, though I don't always see as he does, and wish he were more comprehensive. But it is most significant, and he is flat-footed for you, and from a background of theory which compels respect, and must make the Apaches of criticism pause to think. What is most significant, however, is the article called \"American Poets\" in the October number of the British Quarterly Review. C.W.E. has just sent it to me, and I want to run it over once more, when I will send it to you. It is disfigured by a few lines, but as a whole it is a glorious tribute, and full of splendid and whole-hearted ardor. He reviews all our poets—Lowell, Whittier, Bryant, Longfellow, etc.,—and then puts you far above them all, giving you the larger part of the reviewing space besides. Now when you reflect that the London Quarterly is the great High Tory and aristocratic organ in Great Britain—the very essence of patrician respectability—you will realize where we are, and the advance we have made! The article is a bad blow for the enemy! This is evident by the silence of the Tribune, the Nation, etc., in regard to it. They are mum!I have your article on Burns and am going to read it carefully, when I am a little better. The scan I have given it, made me feel that it was admirable. I look with interest for all the others.If you are writing again to Dr. Bucke, tell him how badly off I am, and that I will answer his letters as soon as I can. At present my brain is just mud—I have a heap of letters unanswered.No matter what the venal press may say, there is no doubt that Julian Hawthorne told the truth about his interview with Lowell, and that Lowell lied. Julian got him into an awful scrape, no doubt, by the publication. 'Tis joy to see a bird like Lowell come to grief with his foreign friends, to whom he toadied so basely.I hope to write you a better letter next time, and that your locomotion and general health may improve. I am always deeply glad to hear from you.AffectionatelyW.D.O'CWalt Whitman. William D. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 10 December 1886"
