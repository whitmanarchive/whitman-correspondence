    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,3 June 1889I have today the new L. of G. \"31 May 1889.\" It is a lovely little book. I am thoroughly delighted with it. I have a few cuttings from eastern papers this evening (sent by a friend) in re dinner. Very glad to see that you were actually present and (more than I expected) spoke a few words. I shall hope to have the papers in full and some short account of the affair in M.S. from you or Horace. I judge from what I see in the papers that the dinner was a success. I am rejoiced, dear friend, that you have stayed with us to get out the big and the last eds. and for this dinner It will surely be patent to all near that you have come to stay—patent or not to the rest it is to me an evident fact. It is wonderfull how much more grip you seem to have on the world now than even five years ago and the last year even has made an immense difference. Yes, Walt, you are undoubtedly an institution and if I live another twenty years (which is very doubtful!) I shall not be surprised to see my highest claims for you (for making which I have been counted a lunatic) broadly and even generally allowed. My copy of Sarrazin has come to hand by the afternoon's mail—it is as you said, a lovely little book. Our spell of dark, cold, rainy weather has let up at last and we have summer again—not very warm yet but getting warm—it is now 5 P.M. a charming warm, bright evening‑our lilacs are out and the grounds look wellLove to you, dear WaltR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 3 June 1889"
