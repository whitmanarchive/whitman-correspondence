    "text": "Eastern Pen.Sept 30. 71.Walt WhitmanWashington D.C.My Dear Mr Whitman:I have many messages for you from some friends in Europe which I promised and so much desired to deliver face to face; and day after day and week after week I promised myself and hoped to come to you, but now I shall not see you till I return; for I am tired of towns and tomorrow set my face to the West. I am weary and want rest, and I cannot rest in cities. My address for a time will be San Francisco and since I cannot see you I should be proud of a letter from you.I am tired of books too and take but one with me; one Rossetti gave me, a \"Walt Whitman\"â€”Grand old man! The grandest, and truest American I know, accept the love of your son.Joaquin MillerJAOQUIN MILLER.San Francisco California Joaquin Miller to Walt Whitman, 30 September 1871"
