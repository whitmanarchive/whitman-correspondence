    "text": "Officers Hospital  Annapolis Md. Feb. 24th 1865 Dear Mother,I arrived here yesterday from the Hotel De Libby and if ever a poor devil was glad to get in a Christian Country it was me.I am perfectly well Mother although I am in the Hospital Buildings, and am not under Medical treatment. The reason that I am quartered here is that the Hotels and Boarding Houses in town are cramed[crammed] full,  I stay here for one dollar and a half a day while the Hotels charge three or four dollars and we are just as comfortable as I want to be. I drew 2 months pay to day and bought a new suit of clothes and now I feel something like a white man.I made an application this morning for a leave of absence for 30 days and I expect to be home in the course of 3 or 4 days.We left Danville on the 19th of this Month and stopped in Richmond untill[until] the morning of the 22d. On our arrival at Richmond I found 2 boxes filled with Clothing and grub for me and the way we went into the eatables while we were in Libby was a caution.Mother I am very anxious indeed to hear from you all and wish you get to write or Telagraph[Telegraph] to me (as soon (as you get this) as possibly I may get it if you write before I leave here.I have lots of yarns to tell you Mother but will wait untill[until] I get home as I cant do justice to the darn Rebs, in a letter.You cant imagine how I want to see you and Mattie and the children and all the rest.Good Night Mothergive my love to allG. W. WhitmanDirect Officers Hospital  Annapolis Md George Washington Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 24 February 1865"
