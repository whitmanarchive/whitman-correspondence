Also, he says, \"a savage article on the other side\"! So we shall have \"proud music of the storm\"!I will write you again presently. Your new book arrived. Professor E. J. Loom is here (the astronomer) is solicitous of the copy for which, he says, he wrote you some time ago. I told him you would send it soon. He is a great friend of yours.W.D.O'C William D.
