I often see your name mentioned in the various papers, and I have your address in my Memorandum Book. Well now to the point. Let us recall your visit previous to the battle of Fredericksburg.The Tent You and I took the rest and the memories of the scenes and the effects of our thoughts there, and since then, the various trials, scenes pleasures, hopes, fears of each us three, Walt, George, Palin, and then how we follow on, and then on the 30th Sept 1864, and then after 3 years & 15 days to be in Command on that extreme left flank, when the order came through the lips of Wright. Keep up a fire, and then our retreat, the last to retreat, and surrender, then on to Richmond and on and on to Danville, then GeorgesGeorge's absence, his return, his few remarks, and then x x our exchange, return, the absence of Sam, of Butler --- Lincoln. Oh Walt what scenes, trials we pass through life yet can we not look back with somewhat of a hope that all was for the best, that we are blessed with light, with Fraternity, Charity & Loyalty to all with Malice towards none, that it is a great pleasure for us, for you to hear from me, that you see I have a lingering appetite to let you and George know that I am still here in this mortal coil and that I desire a few lines from you, that we may at times through the great facilities of the present day correspond and now and hereafter may we hope to be able to see each other in that Celestial light vouchsafed to all mankind.Truly YoursPalin H Simslate Co G 51st New York Vol Infty—1861 to 1865N.B.
