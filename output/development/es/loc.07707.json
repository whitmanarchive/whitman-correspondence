There is quite a (I suppose they claim first class) pretensive magazine \"The New England Monthly\" out in Boston & Horace has been formally invited to write them a ten page article ab't me, (life, works, L of G. &c I suppose of course) wh' he is going to do—$25 pay—nothing new or special with me, condition &c—the old dulness & heaviness—head, (catarrhal?) & bladder—have laid in a cord of good hard dry oak, all sawed— eat pretty heartily—nights so-so—havn't been out for a fortnight—Are you interested in this All-Americas' Delegates' visit here & convention at Washington?—their trip R R, 50 of them, between five & six thousand miles in U S without change of car interests me much—it is the biggest best thing yet in recorded history—(the modern is something after all)— They say this racket is in the interest of protection—but I sh'd like to know how it can be prevented f'm helping free trade & national brother- hood—You fellows are not in this swim I believe—but you tell the Canadians we U S are \"yours faithfully\" certain, & don't they forget it— Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 5 October 1889"
