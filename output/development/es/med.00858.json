    "text": "[11.?.1888]Briefly to answer impromptu your request of Oct: 19—the question whether I think any American poet not now living deserves a place among the thirteen \"English inheritors of unassail'd renown\" (Chaucer, Spenser, Shakspeare, Milton, Dryden, Pope, Gray, Burns, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley and Keats,)—and which American poets would be truly worthy, &c. Though to me the deep of the matter goes down, down beneath. I remember the London Times at the time, in opportune, profound and friendly articles on Bryant's and Longfellow's deaths, spoke of the embarrassment, warping effect, and confusion on America (her poets and poetic students) \"coming in possession of a great estate they had never lifted a hand to form or earn\"; and the further contingency of \"the English language ever having annex'd to it a lot of first-class Poetry that would be American, not European\"—proving then something precious over all, and beyond valuation. But perhaps that is venturing outside the question. Of the thirteen British immortals mention'd—after placing Shakspeare on a sort of pre-eminence of fame not to be invaded yet—the names of Bryant, Emerson, Whittier and Longfellow (with even added names, sometimes Southerners, sometimes Western or other writers of only one or two pieces,) deserve in my opinion an equally high niche of renown as belongs to any on the dozen of that glorious list.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to the editors of the New York Critic, [?] November 1888"
