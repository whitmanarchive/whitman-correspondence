It somehow seems the most encouraging yet—God grant our dear friend may indeed get complete recovery—Write often as you can, dear friend. With me & my affairs no great ripple—I am worldlily comfortable & in good physical condition as usual of late—I went on to New York—was convoyed by my dear old Quaker friend R Pearsall Smith—had a success at the lecture 14th (netted $600 for my self—Andrew Carnegie gave $350 for his box)—had a stunning reception—I think 300 people, many ladies—that evn'g Westminster Hotel—newspapers friendly, everybody friendly even the authors—& returned here Friday 4 p m train from N Y. in good order—Am going over to Phila: this p m to be sculp'd by St Gaudiens, the N Y sculptor who has come on, to do it—Signs of spring rather late, but here—I am call'd to dinner (baked shad)—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Charles W.
