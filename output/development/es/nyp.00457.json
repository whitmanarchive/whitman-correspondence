    "text": "Wednesday noon June 28Publishers secured—(not in the front rank at all, but young, experienced, & I guess square & the proposition to take the book comes vehemently from them)—Rees Welsh & Co:Company 23 south 9th st:street Phila:Philadelphia (dealers in 2d hand books & pub:publishers of law books & some others)—Satisfactory to me, as I see at present, & in prospect. They are to publish L of G. same style as O[sgood]'s ed'nedition, same price, from my plates, & pay me 35 ctscents a copy royalty—They are also to publish immediately my prose writings, Specimen Days, & Collect—a companion vol. to L of G. same price & ab'tabout same size, for which they pay me 22 ctscents royalty. They consider favorably the idea of publishing Dr. Bucke's book also—& I think will do so—though they have not pledged themselves—By what I hear since I wrote last I think the enemy (in Boston) have formally appealed to the Post Master General to order L of G. excluded from the mails under the Comstock statutes—I think the P M G has it before him—perhaps has already decided—I keep well—W WThe Boston Herald has articles strongly in my favor—Cambridge Chronicle also—Boston Globe also—Yours rec'dreceived yesterday— Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 28 June [1882]"
