    "text": "Harvard UniversityCambridge, Mass.Jan. 1, 1889. Dear Walt Whitman,I feel as though I cannot begin the new year without wishing you all possible health and happiness. I hope you will appreciate these greetings of a stranger when he tells you that to him you are no stranger but an ever present comrade.Besides telling you of the great good you have done me I want to assure you of the hearty love you are winning, among the students and teachers here. To me you have been—a guiding star—a light in the wilderness. I trace my highest and best thoughts and feelings to your poems. I wish I could give you some idea of how I feel towards the author of \"Leaves of Grass.\"I hope you will not think this a bait for an autograph, I am above that – I merely want to thank you for the good you have done me.Your humble admirer & wellwisher,O. F. Hershey.see notes Jan 5 1889 O. F. Hershey to Walt Whitman, 1 January 1889"
