    "text": "1874431 Stevens st. cor West.Camden, N. Jersey,Friday noon—Feb.February 6.1874Dear boy Pete,Both your letters came this week—also one from my friend Eldridge, he too speaks of meeting & talking with you.—It is real winter here, the ground all covered with snow, as I look out—not the least thaw to-day, as it is cloudy—I rise pretty late mornings—had my breakfast a little while ago, mutton-chop, coffee, nice brown bread & sweet butter, very nice—eat with very fair appetite—I enjoy my breakfast better than any other meal—(eat a light dinner pretty late, & no supper)—Feel generally about the same as before described—no worse, no better, (nothing to brag of anyhow)I have mentioned about my crossing the ferry—from our house, the cars run by the next corner, (200 feet, or less,) a half mile or so to the ferry—the Delaware here is full three quarters of a mile wide—it is a noble river, not so wide as the Potomac, nor with the fine banks like Arlington, but grander, & with more style, & with powerful, rushing tides, now great processions of broken ice, many little & some great big cakes—the boats are very fine & strong, go crashing right ahead, with a loud noise, breaking the cakes often a foot thick & more—I enjoy crossing these days—it does me good—the ferrymen are all very kind & respectful——I have been reading a book \"Merrie England in the Olden Time,\" a London book, with pictures, full of fun & humor—I have enjoyed it much—There is an awful amount of want & suffering, from no work, hereabout—a young man was here yesterday—had seen me in WashWashington—wanted help—I gave him a little—I see the cars & locomotive skurrying by as I close. Walt Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 6 February [1874]"
