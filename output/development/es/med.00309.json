I do not forget any one so easily, where the friendship has been formed as it was under such circumstances as yours & mine in the hospital. You must write to me whenever you feel like it—tell me all about things & people down there in Kentucky—God bless you, my loving soldier boy, & for the present, Farewell.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to a Soldier, April (?) 1865"
