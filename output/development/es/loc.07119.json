    "text": "InsaneAsylum LondonOntario14 Oct '90A thousand thanks, dear Walt, for your note of 10th enclosing M.S. of O'Connor piece. You know I guess by this time that Mrs O'C. is pleased with the \"preface\"—In her last letter to me she says \"yes, I am very much pleased with what Walt has written.\" She only wishes (like me) that it was longer—but it is as long (I guess) as either of us expected it would be. And, in fact,I do not know but it is long enough. I am real glad to hear that \"Old Poets\" has gone—shall hope to read it soon. This morning came your card of 12th do not worry about me, I am better and shall be down without fail—expect to reach Phila Sunday morning, have written Horace to meet me at Dooner's to breakfast that day—hope to see you toward noon—same day—Sunday—No, my arm was not broken, bad bruise was all—it is much better but still a little stiff and weak. I have the big poster today from Horace—I judge all is going well and I hope we shall have a big crowd. You will not, of course, write here again at present—I leave London Saturday forenoonRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 14 October 1890"
