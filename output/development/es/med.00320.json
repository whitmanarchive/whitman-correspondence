    "text": "Boston,October 28, 1863Friend W.I have taken your proposition into consideration.There is a lion in the way—$I could easily publish a small Book, but the one you propose—to stereotype, advertise and push it—implies an expenditure that may be beyond my means. But if I can get credit, I may try. Whether I will or no depends somewhat on the printer's notions as to whether the book would sell.Suppose you finish it and send it on: if I can't publish it, I will see if some other person won't.This is the best I can safely promise you. If I can get one or two jobbers to read and like it, and they will make an advance order, or give a favorable trade opinion, the way is clear.What say?James Redpath James Redpath to Walt Whitman, 28 October 1863"
