We have been unable to collect, and our statements of last month have failed to bring us in a quarter of what is due. This is only a temporary embarrassment but it places us in an unpleasant position for the time.We hope to be able to forward the amount due you soon and will certainly do so at our earliest possible opportunityWe hope to visit Philadelphia soon and will not fail to call upon you. Hoping that our failure to raise the money will not inconvenience you seriouslyWe remainYours very SincerelyC. P.Charles P. Somerby Charles P. Somerby to Walt Whitman, 16 April 1875"
