    "text": "Germantown Phila:PhiladelphiaAug: 28 '83Dear friendI have been out here 9 or 10 miles from Phil.Philadelphia City Hall all this month at a very secluded place—good quarters, very quiet—on a visit to an old Quaker friend—his large family are all away at Newport—he is absent all day down town at business—& I have the whole premises, house, horse & carriage when I want, large garden, library &c to myself—good grub—with every afternoon a long & delightful drive exploring this beautiful region for miles and miles, Chestnut Hill, Indian Rock, the whole Wissahickon area, &c &c.I have rec'dreceived (June, July, &c) your and Alma's hospitable & affectionate letters, invitations—& I ought to be kicked for not answering them before—but \"you know what a wretch I am about such things\"—never mind, I appreciate them gratefully—I am well as usual this summer—nothing very new ab'tabout my books or literary fortunes—I shall make a permanent move from Camden before many months—as my brother's folks are ab'tabout changing to new quarters at Burlington N J—& I shall not accompany them—I don't know where I shall go.What a glorious summer we have had!—Never one so fine, seems to me—Best love to you all—Specially Alma and Albert.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to John H. Johnston, 28 August 1883"
