    "text": "[London, Ont.,]3 April [188]9Willy Gurd has gone East. Left here this morning on 11.30 train, goes direct to N.Y., will spend a couple of days there buying certain material wanted for meter, then proceed to Danbury to construct gas meter. About end of May he ought to be through and if all goes well I may be East again in June or July. [—] I send you today a copy of my Annual report, after you have looked it over let Horace have it—I have only a very few copies so cannot send one to Each as I intended—tell H. to show it to anyone he knows of who wants to see it. It is warmer today, snow nearly gone, spring may set in in earnest soon now tho' it is still very early with us for any growth. I am well, getting a good rest since my return home, sleep about 10 hours a night right along. Am still very much occupied all day so that I have time to read only a very little—Am just finishing \"Wieland\" [by] Chas. Brockden Brown [/] first of his I ever read (got a set of his books from McKay more than a year ago but never looked at them till now)—it is one of the most ghastly books conceivable, old (Castle of ontranto) style. No doubt you have read some of Brown's books if not all of them. [—] A gloomy but pleasant afternoon here as I sit at my desk in my office and look out the window, roads very sloppy with the melting snow. I hope you are prospering but I fear you are not to any marked extentAlways your friendR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 3 April [188]9"
