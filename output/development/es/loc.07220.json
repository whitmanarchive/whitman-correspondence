ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,8 Aug 1888The Hospital notes \"Last of the war cases\" are intensely interesting—especially the extracts from the Letters to your mother—I should greatly like to read the whole letters and shall ask you to let me see them next time I am East. Traubel gives me somewhat better accounts of your health—I guess you have had some pretty hot weather—it is and has been warm even here but not disagreeably so—you will recollect that I have proofs to 117—my old friend (and yours) Jack Harkness (you will recollect him at Kingston and down the St Laurence[St Lawrence] and up the Saguenay?) will be here today for a little visit. All goes well with us here, we all keep well. I think I told you that Willy Gurd had finished his meter. If we have luck we shall make some money out of it.A charming bright, breezy day warm but not too hotBest love to you,RM BuckeR.M. BuckeSee notes Aug 10-1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 8 August 1888"
