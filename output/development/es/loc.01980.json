    "text": "Indianapolis, Ind.IndianaOct 31st 1868Friend WhitmanYour kind letter received me some time since and owing to your intended pleasure trip I did not reply at the time, but have been noticeing[noticing] the press for note of your return to your official duties & your paper so informed me—I trust your trip has been one of pleasure as well as profit—mental & pecuniary—but alack: pecuniary profits to authors & literary men are small and often meagre as to pennies The woe lieqer[liquor] to quill the Gold —this I know from the experience of some literary friends here. \"B.F. Taylor—\" son of Benj F. \"Snacks\"—Gideon B Thompson—who I think may mak[make] a mark in the world of letters in years to come, yet the past has been any thing but bright or encouraging.I was highly pleased with the article of Col Stinton and think he even drew mildly upon facts as to your Hospital career. none perhaps can appreciate the kindness extended by you, more than I, while a hospital truant, stranger like them, yet the positiveness of your nature drew upon those lives of friendship and fellow love, that in many natures are not reached by years of culture. Slow as I have always been to form friends, I found myself anxious to call you such in a few short days—and how many more have you met like me in the past eight years. But more of this anon, how no doubt \"Leaves of Grass\" will progress to a close, by the way I have been asked several times where your books could be obtained & as I had sent the paper with Col It's better for my freind[friend] B.F. Taylor without making note of it. I have been unable to answer & besides the American News Co to whom we have sent, enformsinforms that your \"Leaves of Grass\" are out of print. Send me the desired information in your next letter.What can you be doing at Washington now, and the elections so close at hand? a freind[friend] to the poor & downtrodden of our country. I would naturally suppose you to be in New York working as I work for the election of Horatio Seymour. all have their influx and you no doubt could bring some to our aid. The affections of the Union Army are of the past. Our foe—working—calls for help. And shall we who have the welfare of our common country at heart refuse to lend that helping hand they now so much need. I am sorry to see that during the campaign the rebellion has been fought over and over again—by patriots—who never knew the battle cry, the terrors and excitement attending these—past issues—let them be of the past. Our country and the fallen foe both need our aid. can we withold[withhold] them? The west is Democratic but fraud upon fraud has given the three critical states to our opponents and we hope to redeem all on tuesday. Ohio is the only one in doubt, and I hope even for it. But ere this reaches you the day will have passed & all decidedThe West is a great country and your summer trip next should be extended hitherward where you may judge of the country people and their hospitality.With kind regards of my family to youI am trulyYours&Will W Wallace Will W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 31 October 1868"
