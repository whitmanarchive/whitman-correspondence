    "text": "LondonDec. 24th 89Dear WaltYour welcome letter came to hand a few weeks ago, and was pleased to hear from you.I am still in London making the best of every thing, & I imagine, doing first rate, I have quiet[quite] a lot of driving to do, sometimes we have a trip of ten or fifteen miles through rain & mud.I had a very good time Christmas, went home & helped to eat the turkey, all my sisters & brothers were there & we had a good time. I am going to see Dr Bucke next week, also have a dance in the new Ball room. I fully intended going before this but kept putting it off.How did you spend Christmas. I hope well. Warren is a pretty good fellow & I hope you hang on to him for it is hard to get a young lad to take an interest in anything about a house, unless they are brought up to it. I would have stayed longer with you only for some of the Camden fellows that was keeping up the nurce[nurse] fund.After being there a few months it was plain enought[enough] to see that I was not good enough for them & if it had not been that you liked me pretty well I would have got the street for a companion long before the summer was over. So I made up my mind to leave in the fall & go at the Veterinary business which I consider was a wise stepYou must write me often so I will know how you are getting along as I am anxious to know. Remember me to Mrs Davis & Warren,Your friendE WilkinsA happy new year to all. Edward Wilkins to Walt Whitman, 24 December 1889"
