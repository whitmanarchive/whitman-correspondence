    "text": "CamdenTuesday noonOct: 9 '88Middling comfortable & easy—take the bitter water—bowel movement this forenoon—weather sunny & cool—I keep a pretty good fire, oak wood—sleep fairly nights (from 12 to 5 must be unbroken in the main, when favorable)—for breakfast to-day 3 or 4 good stew'd oysters, some Graham bread toasted, & a cup of chocolate—ate pretty well (this & yesterday are favorable days)—In my eating neither at all ascetic nor sumptuous—pass two hours to-day putting my autograph to the poetic motto title to L of G. for the big book—Horace bro't the sheets (600 of them) f'm the bindery—David McKay has been over to-day—wants a different binding for N. B. wh' I agree to at his seeing to & expense—thinks the binding I have—like your copy—coarse & cheap—very likely—he paid me $106 royalty—I am satisfied with D McK—Have been looking over Cardinal Manning's & Col. Ingersoll's pieces in N. A. Review—also Mrs. Carlyle's letters (for dessert)— quite a good many visits—a string indeed all day—Our election trial is drawing near a verdict—as I see it, there are some things on each side—no great enthusing tho' they (the Rep[ublican]s) try to make it so—from the view of the solidarity of the common people of all the globe. I lean rather to the Cleveland side, (but I am sometimes squeamish even at that)—but it will be all right any how—Y'r welcome letter came yesterday—I enclose slip from to-day's Phil. Press ab't Dr Osler—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 9 October 1888"
