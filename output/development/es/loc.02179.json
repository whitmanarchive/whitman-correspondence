    "text": "12 Well RoadHampstead.2nd.12.85.Dear Walt The lovely spirit fled on Sunday afternoon at five o'clock.....My darling mother's life has been ebbing for the last year: but she battled along accomplishing much good work in writing with devotion to us and her friends just the same...Four years ago mother was attacked by cancer in the breast, wchwhich never caused her much pain or was the least distressing in any way but gradually sapped her strength. Dilatation of the heart was the immediate cause of death. Ten days ago mother asked me if I had written to you. I said that I had, just a week ago then. Some day next year I am going to send you a photograph from my last picture of mother I painted it this summer. I have painted three elaborate and satisfactory portraits of mother & oh how glad I shall be of them. I and brother (Percy Carlyle Gilchrist) placed her semblance in my father's grave this morning at Kensal-Green and on her tomb I shall find a line from Leaves of Grass. In a little memoranda addressed to us she noted your name down as the one friend in America to whom we were to write to, in announcing darling mother's death. She died in my arms.Herbert Harlakenden GilchristThe last three months she suffered much from cardaiccardiac asthma.H Gilchrist Herbert Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 2 December 1885"
