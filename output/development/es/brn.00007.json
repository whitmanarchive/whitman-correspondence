    "text": "800 SIXTEENTH STREET,LAFAYETTE SQUARE.WashingtonMarch 12.Dear Walt Whitman; I have received your books and MS. and send, with my hearty thanks, a New York check for $30. It is a little more than your modest charge. You will pardon the liberty; I am not giving you anything like what the writing is worth to me, but trying to give a just compensation for the trouble of copying, simply. My boy, ten years old, said to me this morning, \"Have you got a book with a poem in it called 'O Captain! My Captain!' I want to learn it to speak in school.\" I stared at him, bearing you in mind at the moment, as if he were a mind-readerâ€” and asked him where he had heard of that poem. He said a boy had repeated it last year somewhere. I made him happy by showing him the MS. and promising him it should be his if he deserved it, after I am gone. With love and good wishes and hopes that the spring may bring healing on its wings to you I am faithfully yoursJohn Hayfrom John Hay, acknowledging & paying for MS of \"Captain, O Captain!\" John Hay to Walt Whitman, 12 March 1887"
