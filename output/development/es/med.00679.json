Hot weather, awful—yet I am standing it well so far. I suppose you got the Tribune of July 4 with my letter in. And the box of Graham biscuits by Express—(Of course you know they must be soak'd half an hour or more in milk or water—I sweeten mine with sugar, but some dont like it)—How are you getting along this hot weather? & how is that baby?Walt WhitmanI eat my biscuits for supper only—have two or three of them in a bowl soak'd for an hour, & the water pour'd off, & then a little milk, & plenty of sugar—they must be fixed just right, or they ain't good— Walt Whitman to John and Ursula Burroughs, 11 July [1878]"
