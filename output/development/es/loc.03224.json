    "text": "for a healthy handsome youngster of Philadelphia great admirer of L of G & another—who tired of commercial life here, & went out west & is married & busy there Richard E. Labar,REAL ESTATE,NATIONAL EXCHANGE BANK BUILDING.Waukesha, Wis.,Oct 16 1889My dear Mr. Whitman Trust everything is going happily with you— & that you will be on hand—with faculties aglowing—at our World's Fair, Chicago, '92 Dick. Walt Whitman is a poet who refused to be ground in the small mortar of human conventionality. Like Wagner in music, he thought he had a new idea, and resolutely, through a long life, impressed the individuality of that idea on the literature of the new world. It cannot be said that his poetry is good, but it may be maintained that he copied it nowhere. Whether he could write poetry or not, he deserved the thanks of all true Americans for dealing metrical form and ceremony the deadliest blow it has ever received. Such atrocities as Pope's translation of Homer would not be possible in the age of Walt Whitman.—Chicago Herald. Richard Labar to Walt Whitman, 16 October 1889"
