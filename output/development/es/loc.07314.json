    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,3 Sept 1889Yours of 30 & 31 Aug. to hand this afternoon, have read it and the enclosure (Mr. Smith's letter) with much pleasure and interest. Am rejoiced that you keep so well—also to hear of the new pieces coming out in Harper's & Century—be sure and let me know when they appear as I might miss them—Dick of course is at home and at work. Two Londoners out to see me this afternoon about the meter—they are red hot to make some arrangement to manufacture in Canada and I guess we shall give them a chance though nothing can be done until Gurd gets back here—I expect him about the end of this week. We are all well—have been having a hell of a hot time—very dry—no rain for weeks—all burnt up. Tell Horace I want to see the \"Dinner Book.\"R M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 3 September 1889"
