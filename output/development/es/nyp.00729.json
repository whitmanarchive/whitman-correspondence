    "text": "Boston,January 10, 1889.Dear Mr. Whitman:I have word occasionally from you and it gives me great pleasure to know you are so comfortable. I get a card from Kennedy semi-occasionally. He seems to be very busy. I passed a pleasant evening with Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton the present week, and we had some considerable talk of you. She is an appreciative admirer of your work and prizes the chat she had with you last year. She writes a literary letter to the Herald each Sunday and gets in a telling touch once in a while on your work. She is a very charming and able woman. Your stalwart supporter. Judge Chamberlain, of the Public Library, I see frequently: a very thoughtful and fearlessly outspoken man. He does some valuable historical lecturing and often says some inspiringly good things about our artificiality in poetry and the drama. I wonder if it ever occurred to you that our novel and drama is now slowly changing base, coming round to the \"realization of the real.\" The whole outlook to me is full of hope. I think I see in what our aristocratic friends are pleased to call \"vulgarity in fiction and the drama\" the sure sign of the native indigenous literature we have waited for. If I should ever get to see you I should take pleasure in enlarging upon this. It forms the staple for a number of my lectures on the literature of Democracy.Our friend Baxter had an extended notice of the Complete Works in the Herald. You saw it, of course.Filially yours,Hamlin Garland Hamlin Garland to Walt Whitman, 10 January 1889"
