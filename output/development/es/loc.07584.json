    "text": "CamdenMarch 21 '89Noon—Feeling pretty well—dark & rainy (the third day)—News not favorable from O'C[onnor] as you will see by enc'd card—I write a few lines every day to him & send Mrs. O'C the Boston paper. The \"process\" plate (considerably reduced) of that ¾ pict: McK[ay] got in N Y. is good, & I shall use it in book before long—Shall send it you (probably several impressions) soon as I have them printed nicely—definite bowel action this forenoon—the Sat: Review (March 2) has either gone to you, or will soon go (A rather curious notice)—I haven't seen Lawyer Harned since you went—Horace was in this forenoon—faithful & invaluable as ever—Mrs: Davis has come in for a few moments to see if I am \"all right\"—Ed has been making up the bed.Toward sunsetHad a good thorough bath this afternoon, hot water—my \"cold\" has not altogether withdrawn—I feel it in the head perceptibly enough an hour or two now and then—heavy sloppy muddy day—I almost envy your having such lots to do, responsibilities & strong & well & energetic to do 'em—My lassitude is one of the worst points in my condition—but whether Sidney Morse's man's answer (when reproach'd for drunkenness) \"Suppose 'twas so intended to be,\" was right or no—Mrs: Davis's woman's remark is \"So it really is any how\"—& answers all philosophy & argument (up to a certain line you probably say)—Well I will adjust myself for dinner, & hope you & Mrs B & all are having good times—& send my love to all—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 21 March 1889"
