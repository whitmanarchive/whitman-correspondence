Herbert, see about the stove & have put up soon as convenient—& have some dry oak wood sawed the right length, split, & carried up there, & piled in the room. Send me word before the end of the week. I wish much to come—Love to all—Walt Whitman(rec'd yesterday a letter from Wm Rossetti, which I will just enclose— & take again when I come over) Walt Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist, [Early 1877]"
