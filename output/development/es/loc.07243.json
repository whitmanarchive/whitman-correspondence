    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIO London, Ont.,19 Sept 1888The weather remains serene. A charming hazy, cloudy, windy, autumn day. I am trying to get on with my annual report but it moves slowly—however I have time and I shall no doubt come out of it as usual in due course. All looks well with the meter, we had a first class business man & capitalist to see it this week. We offered him a share with us for a certain sum, and for the benefit of his advice and assistance. He consider'd the meter such a big thing that he proposed to associate a more active business man still than himself and a man with more capital and more access to the great money centres. He has written to this man to come up from Montreal to look into the matter. I think it quite likely we may all make all the money we want out of it.How are things with you and the new vols? I hope to have a copy of the \"Complete Works\" very soon now—the \"N.B.\" in its new dress will be heartily welcome tooHas Osler been over to see you yet? He must be back in Phila by now?I hope you are not suffering too much—I know well you are not having a good time. But I am sure it will be all right at lastYour friendRM BuckeSee notes 9/22/88 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 19 September 1888"
