    "text": "BrooklynOctober 20 | 1865 Dear friend, Your letter came right—& was glad to hear from you, Nelly, & Charles Eldridge & dear little Jeannie—(I will not add William because I did not hear any thing about him.) Nelly, the skies are brighter here than when I wrote you last. Little sis is so much better, that she has been twice brought down here to the front basement, & has in every respect improved much since last Saturday—Then my mother arrived home last Tuesday—and now it looks something like home in reality—I am quite well—Drum Taps will be bound (a small edition) before you get this—& will next week be put in the hands of a New York publisher & launched on the market—at least that's my design at present—When you write tell me all about William—My mother returns bringing cheerful intelligence upon the whole—& is herself in splendid condition—havn't[haven't] seen her look & apparently feel better in many years—My brother George (or did I tell you?) is working again at his trade & has grand health—Love & Farewell—Walt. Walt Whitman to Ellen M. O'Connor, 20 October 1865"
