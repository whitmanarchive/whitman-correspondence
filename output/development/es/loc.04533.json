I send certificate of stock of 200 shares of the Sierra Grande Mining Company made out in your name. So far very regular dividends of twenty five cents per share per month have been made to the shareholders, but whether they will continue for twelve months only or for a course of a years, no one can say. The experts predict a long course of years. In any case you will receive from the Treasurer by mail, sent about the first of each month, a cheque for fifty dollars till the mine shall work out.As it is a personal matter between our two selves, you will kindly, as you proposed, devise it back to me in the final disposition of your means—may the which be in a far distant future!And may its use prove of as much pleasure to you as it gives me to ask to place the income at your disposal.Yours faithfullyR.
