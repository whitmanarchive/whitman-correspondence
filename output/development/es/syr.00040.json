    "text": "[London, Ont.,]21 March [188]9I was very glad to get (this morning) your card of 19th and to hear that you were feeling passably. I find I have \"Dark Blue\" for Nov. 7, (as well as oct—the beginning of R.N.'s article) but my copy has not the picture (very bad one by the way) [/] I am a little sorry therefore I did not take the Nov. n.o you offered me. The weather here is gloomy but pleasant in temperature. All is well and quiet with us. You might give the enclosed receipt to Horace to be handed to Harned—so he will see we settled with the meter Co. I have found another misprint in L. of G. (I suppose it is a mi/s/print p. 145 harpooner is printed harpooneer.—The new (1864) photo you gave me is greatly admired here—I look upon is as a great prizeYour friendR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 21 March [188]9"
