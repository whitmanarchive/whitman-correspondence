George has been out here since last May he is stout he has done considerable work for me and we have had some nice rides going to the Political meetings last fall and we have elected our Man and I hope and pray he will with Gods help settle this trouble before long.Walter I am sorry to inform you that I never got the paper you sent me and I think you better come out here yourself and give us the particulars yourself we would be very happy to see you, we all send our best respects to you and all your friends.you will see my pen and ink are both poor and myself a poor writerâ€”so I will close by wishing you a happy New Year from your true friend Herman Storms to Walt Whitman, 11 January 1865"
