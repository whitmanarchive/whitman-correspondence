    "text": "London,Ontario,Canada 23 Sep. 1891 Dear Walt, Thank you for the two papers received today—containing many items of interest, the Herbert Spencer interviews included. And thank you still more for the kind, constant thought which prompts you to send them. Another day of midsummer warmth & beauty—It seems a land of perpetual summer, & I begin to fear that when I get back to England—especially during our November fogs—I shall be dissatisfied & look back on my Canadian experiences with envy. I think, however, that my main feeling will be gratitude that my trip was so fortunate in all its circumstances. And, indeed, I am deeply thankful that I am so blessed. This morning I went with Dr. Bucke through the North Bldg. (Refractory Wards.) Patients as a rule more or less happy (not many melancholic) & well looked after. But what thoughts, feelings, & problems they rouse!—I asked Dr. Beemer about your visits, & though I did not learn much, what he did tell me was characteristic. I spent the rest of the morning in looking over the papers you sent, & in copying some of the letters to Pete Doyle that the doctor has. These have quite a fascination to me, in the side lights they throw on your most kind & loving soul. God bless you & our love to you. After dinner I went to the Fair along with the children & Mrs. Beemer's sister. Many thousands of people there—from the entire province I think.—The general average very good—fine looking people as a whole, well-behaved, & comfortably prosperous—English looking—but with a difference hard to define. Since tea I have been across to office for a letter from our loyal & indefatigable friend Traubel. Lovely glowing western sky. I hope that this long spell of beautiful weather will prove beneficial to you (as indeed it must do) & I am heartily relieved & glad that the reports so far have been so favourable. Health, & immunity from pain to you, & serenest joys. Please give my love to Mrs. Davis & Warry. With best love to you always Yours affectionately J.W. WallaceP.S. A busy week at the Asylum. Shoals of visitors to the Fair come on to see the Asylum— but not so many (says Dr B) as in past years. James W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 23 September 1891"
