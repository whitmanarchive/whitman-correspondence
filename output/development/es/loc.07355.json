    "text": "London, Ont.,27 July 1890A beautiful July day. Warm enough but not hot. All here peaceful and quiet. Am in my office, it is now noon. I have attended chapel, written a few letters (to Kennedy and others) & pause to think, to take stock of my surroundings and what is next to do. I had a long good letter from Horace two days ago. He is a good fellow—you have no better friend I like him well for your sake and for his own.No word from Willy Gurd for about a week I expect him home almost daily—he has had some delay—some work he could notget done as expected—guess he must be about over the hitch by this time.I say, Walt, what became of that letter of Symonds' to you which you were going to send me some months ago? You were going to have it set up but I guess did not—Has Horace got it or where is it? I should like much to see it.I had a card a few days ago from Mrs O'C. It seems to be hot down there in Washington—there is no place can beat right here in the summer—it is a lovely place and a most charming summer climateBest love to you, dear WaltRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 27 July 1890"
