    "text": "ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington,Dec. 14, 1866.Dear boy & comrade, I rec'd your letter of the 9th—& am real glad to hear from you, & that you are well & in good spirits, as appears by your letter. You speak how much you would like to see me, & we could be together a while. I too, dear friend, would be so glad if we were near each other where we could have each other's company often.I am still working here in the same office—We have lately a new Attorney General—One of the first things he did was to promote me!—Sensible man, wasn't he?—May the Lord reward him. I have been absent on leave the past summer two months—went to New York—spent most of the time with my mother, in Brooklyn—I have been well since I last wrote to you, mostly—only the last six weeks have had rather a bad time with neuralgia—but am getting over it.Things with friend Hiram Frazee have gone poorly. He went from Harewood hospital here, to Brooklyn, to the City Hospital there—he had a terrific operation there that nearly cost him his life, & after all did no good—it was a pay hospital, & his stay in it cost him $300—The last I heard of Frazee was about two months ago—he was then home—his address is Hiram W. Frazee, Camden, Oneida Co. New York—he wrote me, & said he was as comfortable as one in his condition could be—he spoke about you in his letter, & wanted much to know about you—Wood I have not heard from.Here in Washington Congress is in session, & rather lively times—I suppose you see the acc'ts in the papers.Dear Comrade, you don't give me the particulars what you are doing, &c. you must, when you write again—you speak of not being overburdened with green backs, & profits &c.—Well, boy, one can bear that, if one only keeps hearty & fat & in good spirits, as I guess you are.Well, I keep about as stout as ever, and my face red & great beard just the same as when I used to see you—I eat my rations every time, too—I am writing this in the office by a big window with a splendid view of the Potomac & Arlington Heights—Well I find I must close—I send my love to you, darling boy, & I want you always to keep me posted wherever you go, dear Comrade.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Anson Ryder, Jr., 14 December 1866"
