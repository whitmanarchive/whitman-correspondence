    "text": "CamdenJan: 29 '89Am feeling pretty well considering. My obstinate spell of indigestion continues though—I take the Frederickshall water every morning—drink a cup of coffee every breakfast now—(after an abstinence of four or five months)—eat rather lightly—mutton broth yet—a few bits of the well-stew'd mutton, good graham bread toasted—only two meals—no ice cream lunch at 1½ as formerly, at all—in fact follow out the theory & advice (in general, in main) indicated by y'r letters of three or four weeks ago—appetite-relish pretty good—no bother with bladder troubles—seems to be fair skin condition, a little sweat perceptible most every day—no doctor at all now for a week or ten or more days (I think Walsh is ill)—Have you rec'd the French magazine with Sarrazin's article, from Kennedy? It seems to be one of the most ardent & penetrative, & eulogistic sort—I have sent him a copy of the big book by mail—Edward Carpenter has sent me the Scottish Art Review notice by him (E C) of Nov: B—I will send it to you—Horace has it now—I have order'd 50 copies of the fine binding from the Phila: binder (Oldach)—shall keep one for you—30 or 35 will go to McKay on sale—I note what you say of Howells's opinion in Feb: Harper's—indeed it contrasts with such as Sarrazin's review in the Nouvelle Revue & in that Nineteenth Century piece (Dec: '82)—I receive word from O'Connor to-day from Mrs: O'C (enclosed) & it is rather gloomy. Of course he ought to have a good man nurse—needs that more than I do—poor dear friend—I fear more definitely physically wreck'd than ever—I am thinking ab't him all day— the impression I get is that the meter is a success & a prospect, but the work of such things is so slow & aggravating—sunny to-day, rather windy & cold—I am sitting by the oak fire—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 29 January 1889"
