    "text": "Please note my present, (& permanent) addressWinsteadTemple Road, RathminesDublinFeb 6. 1876.Dear Mr Whitman,Since I wrote last I received a letter from you, acknowledging my Shakspeare[Shakspeare] book, the E.A.Edward Allen Poe newspaper, & that with the lecture on Shakespeare in it. Thank you for all. It is very pleasant to think that you remember me.The news of your health is that of the chief interest to me. And in one way or another I have heard about you several Times. I trust you do not work when you ought to rest. For any affection such as yours I should suppose entire rest & open air to be essential conditions of recovery; & such lying fallow would be fruitful in the End with you.Nevertheless I rejoice to hear of the Two Rivulets & your Memoranda of the war being ready. I enclose a draft or bill on the Bank of England for what they tell me is the Equivalent of ten dollars. Would you please send me the new Edition of L. of G.Leaves of Grass & Two Rivulets, & Memoranda, but if the Postage is heavy don't send the Memoranda, & let that so far compensate you for your loss by postage to Ireland. I should like to have my name written in Each book by you. (unless you object)—I suppose you have seen Peter Bayne's vicious (& the word is applicable in a literary sense as well as an Ethical) article on your writings in The Contemporary Review. As to myself I feel that I have a small grievance to complain of—his selecting scraps from my Westminster article, out of connection with their environment, to Employ against you as admissions of one who stands on your side. I trust you have not so far forgotten my article as to think my meaning was that Attributed to me by Peter Bayne. Such an article as this may with some readers delay the understanding of your book, but others, as I know, will have their curiosity quickened by it to see for themselves what the phenomenon—L. of G.Leaves of Grass—really is. I see on all sides Tokens of a continuous advance in England towards appreciation of your poetry. Occasional references to Walt Whitman in reviews & magazine articles now, as a rule, tacitly admit your position as secured, instead of being as once was the case, contemptuous. I will send, if I can find it, a copy of an article by a young barrister friend of mine, O'Grady, which appeared in The Gentleman's magazine the same month in which Peter Bayne's article appeared.Lately I read a paper on your poems before a Club here—The Fortnightly Club & The feeling was, to a degree which surprised me, favourable to your writings; & in College I read the same paper to a large class of students reading along passages from your Vistas & L. of G,Leaves of Grass, to which a response of almost involuntary applause was given,—a murmur & low response of satisfaction after complete silence & attention.I had a pleasant letter from John Burroughs, & got from him a copy of his Winter Sunshine. This is to me a delightful little book. He is so close to nature, yet with such a quick, living human consciousness. His writing has some of the wholesome influence upon me that the sunshine, & snow, the apples & the birds themselves have: and this is all the more precious to me because my work as Professor has a constant tendency to tide me away from what is fresh & vital into mere accumulation, & \"culture\", of a kind which is not life, but mere apparatus, machinery, & dead pelf of knowledge.Swinburne's \"Erechtheus \"the critics here are going into fits of admiration about. I am disappointed by it. In comparison with it Atalanta in Calydon was severe in style; here everything is lost & engulphedengulfed in a welter of words. And Browning's new poem,—in spite of continued loyalty to Browning,— afflicts me by its choice of an unworthy subject.A friend of mine—Miss West—has printed a little pamphlet of verses which perhaps she may send to you. They are some in sonnet form; & as regards executive power very unequal: for prose & not verse is her fine medium of expression. The spirit of them is somewhat stern & self repressive; yet a capacity for joy is apparent in them; several are occupied with religious doubt, & Emotions connected with it; & in the last two or three the result arrived at is declared—a stoical acceptance of our ignorance of the mystery of the world; with a certain amount of hope, founded upon the good things of human friendship & fellowship which life has revealed to the writer. (I write of what you have not seen, & I am not sure that she will think them worth sending to you).I am, dear friend,Yours most truly,Edward Dowden. Edward Dowden to Walt Whitman, 6 February 1876"
