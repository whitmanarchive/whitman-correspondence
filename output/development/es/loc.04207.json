    "text": "16 UP. Gloucester Place, Dorset Square, LondonJan. 8, 1877.Dear Walt Whitman:Pray forgive my long silence. I have been deep in troubles of my own. All the books have arrived and been safely transmitted. Many thanks.You have doubtless heard about affairs in England. The tone adopted by certain of your friends here became so unpleasant that I requested all subscriptions etc. to be paid over to Rossetti, and received no more myself. During a certain lawsuit against the Examiner, your admirers—notably Mr. Swinburne—pleaded against me that I had praised you, cited your words against me in court etc. I never was so shocked and astonished, for I would not have believed human beings capable of such iniquity.As I think I told you before, I shall ever regret the insertion of certain passages in your books (Children of Adam etc). I do not believe them necessary or defensible. These passages are quoted as being the work of an immoral writer, and, altho'although I tried to show they were part of a system of philosophy, it would not do. I know the purity and righteousness of your meaning, but that does not alter my regret.I think your reputation is growing here, and I am sure it deserves to grow. But your fatal obstacle to general influence is the obnoxious passages. I wish you would make up your mind to excise them with your own hand.God bless you!—May your trouble lift, and may happy days be in store for you!—Let me know about your affairs. I may soon be in a position to help you more definitely.Yours ever,ROBT. BUCHANAN. Robert Buchanan to Walt Whitman, 8 January 1877"
