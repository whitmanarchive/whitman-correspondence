    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,25 Aug 1888I was glad last evening to get a card from you dated 22d. I wish I could see you to have a real good talk with you about the \"Complete Works,\" I have a feeling that there is a chance to do something really worth while, something quite in the monumental style in the care of this vol. I should like to see it—what it might easily be—something unique & special. I trust you will give it full consideration before taking any actual steps. The \"Nov. Boughs\" I think decidedly should be published at a low figure and it should contain a full advertisement of the \"C.W.\"—be a sort of avant courier of these. I will not trouble you by repeating all I have said in former letters on this subject but leave it now to your serious consideration.Today John Nesbit comes down and he, Willy Gurd & myself will have a consultation re the meter. The meter is the great thing with us here just now and will be until it is put into some kind of shape—something definitely settled about it.We are all well.I send my love to youRM BuckeSee notes Aug. 27, 1888. Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 25 August 1888"
