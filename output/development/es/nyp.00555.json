I am here not much different from usual late years, but older, more broken & paralyzed—I have a little old cottage of my own in which I live, & have a good young woman, a widow, for cook & housekeeper—I am fearfully disabled, yet retain good spirits—have just been out for a drive—Often think of Helen (dear Helen) and you & all—Is this letter address'd right?—I should occasionally send H. a letter or paper, but am doubtful ab't the address—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Arthur Price, 25 January 1887"
