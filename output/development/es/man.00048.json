    "text": "CamdenJuly 22ndDear Walt.I found your letter and Mrs Gilchrists and Mr Carpenters on my return, and we were much alarmed at first by reports, that you were very sick, but yesterdays[yesterday's] Ledger, I think gave the true thing, just about what you wrote to us. I hope by this time you are on the mend, and will be able to make your trip. I have had such a delightful time, no heat, and we had no trouble on our trip, every thingeverything passed along pleasantly. It seems to me that if one were to travel the world over one could not find anything to compare with the Falls. Watkins Glen is wonderful too, we were fortunate in Hotels, and every thingeverything, I brought home some views of the Glen and Falls. Aunt Libbie is here still. Geo is well, in fact I never saw him look better, busy as ever, no time to ride much. Mrs Berry and family, have gone to Moorestown to board this summer. Mrs Wetherbee is away in Boston, Wht Marian Pains, so our place is quiet. Mrs Wilson's infant is getting well. When I came home and found that the report was that you were very sick, I said that if I had known that, I would have gone to Canada, but the next day it was put in a milder way. I saw Mr Scovel in a street car the other day, I beleive[believe] there is nothing else new. I can hardly tell about my trip, but when you return, it will be as well, and you have passed over so much of the same country.We all send love.Louhope you will write soon and tell us how you are Louisa Orr Whitman To Walt Whitman, 22 July 1880"
