    "text": "328 Mickle Street CamdenDec: 21 '85My dear friendReal glad to hear from you once more, as by yours of 18th—The death of Mrs: Gilchrist is indeed a gloomy fact—she had cancer, & suffered much the last three months of her life with asthma—for a long time \"every breath was a struggle,\" Herbert expresses it—the actual cause of death was dilatation of the heart. Seems to me mortality never enclosed a more beautiful spirit—The trouble ab't my eyesight passed over, & I use both eyes now same as before—I am living here, rather monotonously, but get along—as I write, feel ab't the same as of late years—only the walking power seems quite gone from me, I can hardly get from one room to another—sometimes quite force myself to get out a few yards, but difficult & risky—O'Connor seems to be holding on at Washington—I think he is middling well, except the leg power—his \"gelatine legs\" he calls them—will pass over I rather think—I drove down yesterday (Sunday) to my friends the Staffords, 10 miles from here, & staid three hours, had dinner &c—I go there every Sunday—So I get stirr'd up some, but not half enough—three reasons, my natural sluggishness & the paralysis of late years, the weather, & my old, stiff, slow horse, with a lurking propensity to stumble down—The \"free will offering\" of the English, through Rossetti, has amounted in the past year to over $400—I am living on it—I get a miserable return of royalties from McKay, my Philad. publisher—not $50 for both books L of G. and S D for the past year—John, I like both the names in your note—I cannot choose—if I lean at all it is in favor of \"Spring Relish\"—either would be first rate—Did you get W S Kennedy's pamphlet \"the Poet as a Craftsman\"—I hear from Dr Bucke quite often—he was the past season somewhat broken in physical stamina & health—but is better—he gives up for the present his European tour, but is coming here soon for a week—As I close, my bird is singing like a house afire, & the sun is shining out—I wish you were here to spend the day with me—W WMerry Christmas to you and 'Sula and the boy— Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 21 December 1885"
