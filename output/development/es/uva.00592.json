I am sitting up days most of the time—diet on mutton-broth & milk & toast bread—am very feeble, cannot get across the room without assistance—have a nurse, a good, strong Canadian young man—my mentality ab't the same as hitherto—have mean time bro't out \"November Boughs,\" 140 pages, & a big Vol. 900 pages, my \"Complete Works,\" every thing poems & prose—both Vols: at your service—Best wishes & thanks—(I believe you have my Mrs: Gilchrist book)—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Karl Knortz, 8 January 1889"
