    "text": "EdwEdward Carpenter June 3 '76 2 sets sent 4 vols altogether45. Brunswick SquareBrighton3. June 1876Dear friend,I have, yesterday, transmitted to you through the Post Office an order for £1. It is from a friend of mine, Charles. G. OatesMeanwoodsideLeeds and he desires me to ask you to send him a copy of your volume 'The Two Rivulets'.I am reading your Memoranda &c of the war with great interest. How wonderful that drama of the world enacting itself—that drama of the death of Feudalism, as you call it I think, and of the birth of Democracy—& Lincoln dying in the birth! and to see it enacted through individuals whom you wd.would love & hold by the hand, themselves unconscious—with their clear unsearchable eyes and hidden dramas of their own.The sense of 'unearthliness' is somehow fused with Democracy, I think.I hope you will get pretty well set up this summer. I was glad to hear you were better. The second pair of your volumes has not arrived for me, up to this date.Yours, as ever,E. Carpenter. Edward Carpenter to Walt Whitman, 3 June 1876"
