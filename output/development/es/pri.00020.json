    "text": "431 Stevens st.Street Camden, N.New Jersey U S America—April 7 '761876Dear friend,This is to acknowledge yours of the 25th March—those of the 16th and of the 20th, duly rec'dreceived, were previously acknowledged.My letters (that of March 17, in which I outline the situation & my wishes—that of 23d, postal c'd.—that of 29th, on sending the Two Volumes, publication copy L. of G.Leaves of Grass and Two RRivulets—that of April 1 conveying fuller & more detailed statement of views & wishes—& a short letter afterward, same date) have conveyed I think substantially all I desire to say on the whole affair. If the cable telegram in the evening papers of Tuesday last here correctly synopsizes MMoncure D Conway's letter about my case in some London paper or papers of that date, I do not approve his letter. It seems singularly malapropos—& in the face of my friends—their efforts there. I believe I ought to look over your two last letters again, & say something further about the transcripts of my kind & generous friends—but cannot to-day—will soon. Send me, at your convenience, the papers that print my things—also any notable criticism or letter, (of course don't mind the small fry.) I know I am troubling your time & activity a good deal, but I won't make any apology about it further than to say that I am sure I deeply appreciate it. Good bye for this time & God bless you my dearest friend.Walt WhitmanYour parcel of books by express has been delayed—not yet gone—will go in two or three days—You must have rec'dreceived the 3 copies by mail?— I am still, still up & around, not much different in condition Walt Whitman to William Michael Rossetti, 7 April 1876"
