    "text": "Camp near Falmouth Va Dec 16th/62Dear Mother.We have had another battle and I have come out safe and sound, although I had the side of my jaw slightly scraped with a peice[piece] of shell which burst at my feet.On Thursday morning last before daylight one of our Regts, commenced to throw a Pontoon Bridge across the River when the Rebel sharpshooters opened on them from the houses along the bank of the River, and our Artillery began to Shell the Town. The Rebel Batteries opened upon ours and a terrible Canonnading was kept up all day. Just before night our fellows succeeding in getting a bridge across and a Regt of Infantry attempted to cross but the Rebs drove them back. Our Regt had been under arms all day, and was then ordered down, but before we got there some of our troops managed to get across and hold the landing untill[until] they were reinforced when they drove the Rebs to the outskirts of the Town and we were ordered back to Camp. Early on Friday morning we went over, but there was no general engagement although skirmishing was going on all day, but we were not engaged at all. About 8 Oclock on Saturday morning our side made an advance driving the Rebel Skirmishers back about a mile and a half from the river, and into their earthworks and about noon the fight became general. The enemy were posted in an almost impregnable position on a range of hills which they have covered with breastworks for Artillery and Rifle pitts[pits] for Infantry while between them and the Town from which we had to advance is an open plain swept on all parts by their guns and at the foot of the hills is a narrow creek, with a steep muddy bank on each side, over which it would be impossible to charge and as they were almost entirely protected by their breastworks you can imagine what an advantage they had over us. About 9 O clock in the morning our Regt was ordered to support a Battery. but it was in such an exposed position that they could not work the guns, and after looseing[losing] several men they were forced to haul off and we laid still untill[until] about 3 Oclock when we were ordered up to the front. Our whole Brigade formed in line and advanced beautifully over the plain and up to the bank of the creek, under a most terrible fire of Rifle balls, Cannister, and Shell,  after getting to the edge of the creek we lay down and blazed away untill[until] night  Other Brigades and Divissions[Divisions] followed us in and lay down behind us but we could get no further, and after dark the fireing[firing] ceased and we all fell back to the Town except 3 Brigades who was left to hold the ground untill morning when we supposed the fight would be renewed but Sunday passed and no fighting. On Sunday night our Regt went out on Picket within 200 ft of the enemys[enemies] breastworks but we were protected by a slight raise of the ground but we had to lay down flat all the time for as soon as we got up the Rebs cracked away at us, last night all the troops fell back on this side of the river takeing[taking] up the bridge and here we are now.the mail is just Closeing[Closing]  So good Bye all  did you get the money  write immediately[Unsigned} George Washington Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 16 December 1862"
