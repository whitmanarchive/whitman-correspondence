    "text": "See notes Aug 29, '88Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,27 Aug 1888A small party of us, Dr. Sippi (the Bursar of the asylum) Wm Gurd (the inventor) John Nesbit (partner with Gurd & self in the meter & motor) Fred. Kittermaster (a lawyer, nephew of Mrs Bucke's & good friend of mine) and one of my little boys drove yesterday to Delaware (15 ms.) had dinner and spent some hours with a Mr Gibson, stockbreeder there, and got back home at 9:45 P.M. It was a charming day—ripe grain in the fields—apples hanging thick in the orchards—clouds diving overhead—long swells of hill & valley often a prospect of several miles ahead or at one side or other of the road—a good team, free travelers—altogether a grand day—today up to my eyes in work again, but feel like it and enjoy it—next month the annual report once more (it seems one annual report fairly treads on the heels of the one in advance of it) such is life, but what matter—if time flies—(as it does) is there not plenty of it? \"We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers, there are trillions ahead and trillions ahead of them\" so what matter?Love to you alwaysRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 27 August 1888"
