    "text": "Attorney General's OfficeWashingtonJuly 27, 1867.My dear friend,Will some of you, the first time you go down town, stop at office (or shop) of E. Godkin, 130 Nassau st. & see if you can get me two or three copies of a new paper, the London Chronicle, with a piece about Leaves of Grass &c. I think it must be the paper for June 22—(though it may be June 29—or June 15)—but you must look & see—Godkin is the American agent. I am well as usual—work in the same office—all goes on the same in the office & generally. Mother has moved to 1194 Atlantic street—(not av.)—opposite Hamilton st. You take Fulton av. cars. Ellen O'Connor is going for the summer to coast of Rhode Island—her little girl Jenny is afflicted with bad swellings &c of joints—appears to be scrofulous—William O'Connor is well—How are you all? Write me a good long letter—tell me all the news—all about the girls, & Mr. Arnold—& the last from Arthur, & every thing—So good bye for this time—I send you my love, dear friend, & same to the dear girls—& to all. Walt.If you can get the papers, direct them to me   Attorney Gen's Office— Walt Whitman to Abby H. Price, 27 July 1867"
