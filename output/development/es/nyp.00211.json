    "text": "ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington,Oct. 16, 186 Dearest mother,I have not heard any thing from you the last week, but I hope you are well & every thing goes right. I sent you a letter last Tuesday, as usual. I suppose you have got your copy of the new book—I feel satisfied with the looks of it—it might be better, & handsomer paper, &c—but I am glad it turns out as good as it is—for, in making a book, you can't be certain how it is going to look, till it is all completed. Then I feel sure it tells the meaning better than any of the former editions—My enemies, & those who are determined to find fault, will of course still do so—But I feel that the book proves itself to any fair person—& will have a fair chance now, & go ahead. But the best thing is, it is done—& I shant[shan't] worry myself any more with fixing & revising it—I have sent a copy to Han—& wrote her a letter—I am feeling first rate in health—I have a good place to eat—get good victuals & plenty of 'em—After the biggest rain-storm I ever knew, we have splendid weather here just now. In the office here, every thing goes on the same as usual. I like Mr. Stanbery—Ashton, the Assistant, will probably remain here this winter—I hope Jeff won't neglect to vote—George of course will vote—Love to Mat—Well good bye, dear mother, till next time. Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 16 October 1866 (?)"
