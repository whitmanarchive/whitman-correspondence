Though mainly the same as for a tedious long while, I have fluctuated (& am fluctuating) through a series of bad spells—brain & other organs—these current times. My general strength, however, from fair to middling. Dont feel to leave my anchorage here, just now—but hope yet to take advantage of your affectionate & hospitable offers. Walt WhitmanThe engraving holds its own—satisfies me more & more—Joaquin Miller has visited me here—very pleasant— Walt Whitman to William J. Linton (?), 9 June [1875?]"
