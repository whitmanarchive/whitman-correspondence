Gen. Grant. Date it from the office of the Times, which will add to its effect, & recal[recall] you to Gen. Grant. It is to request him to give directions, that one of the special exchanges (of which they are now making quite a number) shall be made, in favor of my brother George, and also another officer same regiment. State in short terms that Capt. Whitman has been in active military service of U. S. since April, 1861, nearly four years, has borne his part bravely in battles in nearly every part of the war in the United States, east & west, including Vicksburgh & Jackson, Miss.—has an aged widowed mother in deepest distress. Ask Gen. G. to order a special exchange ofCapt George W. Whitman, 51st New York Vol. & Lieut Samuel Pooley,25 51st New York Vol.both of whom are now, or were lately, in C. S. Military Prison, in Danville, Va. (both the above officers have been promoted from the ranks for conduct on the field)—Walt WhitmanMy address is simply to Washington D. C. as I go to post office for my letters. Walt Whitman to John Swinton, 3 February 1865"
