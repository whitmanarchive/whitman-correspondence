You know you have done much to make a man of me, more than any other being has done, & you have sent me five vols of yr works. So don't hesitate to accept. I am doing well in business just now. Tell Traubel that I am glad indeed to hear of the supper & will help him all I can.As soon as the Concord School starts up I must see about the Morse bust.I privately tell you that I don't much fancy public glorifications, & wish the supper cd be private. It wd be so much more agreeable to have no newspaper blatherskiting over it.W. S. KennedyRead the Wyatt Eaton piece on J. Fr. Millet in May Century. He says Millet resembled you in person, & GeoGeorge Fuller our artist, who, by the way lived next to you here in Belmont9.102736.10 William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 24 May 1889"
