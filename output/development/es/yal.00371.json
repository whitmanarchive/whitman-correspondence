    "text": "William Inglis Morse Washington,February 19, 1888Dear Sirs:Messrs. Routledge Publishers Broadway.By your note of 18th, from New York, just received, I find that Mr. Edmund Routledge, editor, would, (I quote,) like to keep & use an original three‑page poem sent him from me, but demurs to my first‑asked price—that he directs you to offer me 10 pounds, which you can send me, $50: in gold— & that, (the terms being settled,) he will advertise it very largely.I accept the terms offered—and you can forw'dforward me the amount as soon as convenient. I repeat that I distinctly reserve the right of printing the piece in a future edition of my poems.Sending best wishes & respects to editor & publishers, I remain.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to George Routledge & Sons, 19 February 1868"
