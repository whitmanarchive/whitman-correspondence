    "text": "see notes Dec 27 1888American Social Science Association.Concord, Mass.,Dec. 25 1888Dear Friend;I received your noble volume of Works, just in time to make it a Christmas present from you,—and none could have been more highly valued. I hope it may not be the final Edition but that you may live to add more prose and verse to the monument which will preserve your name in the Future, for which you write, and to which you truly belong. But in the Present and the Past also you have done your work, and thus have gained a claim on the Future, which will not be denied you.I cherish two copies of the first edition of your Leaves of Grass—one given me by Emerson in the year it was published, and one left to me by Sophia Thoreau—her brother Henry's copy. I shall place these and your full-grown volume together, and hand them down to my childrenI enclose the report of an essay I lately read in New York. The ommitted passage is one about Emerson which did not properly belong there, and was not read by me,— but the reporter found it among the sheets which I handed him to use, not to print entire.yours with friendly regardF. B. SanbornWalt WhitmanCamden, N. J. Franklin Benjamin Sanborn to Walt Whitman, 25 December 1888"
