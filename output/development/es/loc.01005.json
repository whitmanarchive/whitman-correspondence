    "text": "Jesse Whitman, a laboring man, in the engineer's department—has for some time been working in the provision store—was yesterday told that \"his services were dispensed with.\" This is to apply that he be continued in employment. He is a steady industrious man, and was strongly recommended by Mr. Kalbfleish, the Mayor, and kept on by Mr. Graham, the late engineer. Can bring a request from Mr. Wall, M. C. or Mr. Humphrey, late M. C. if desired—but it is hoped that the engineer will continue him on in employment without Walt Whitman to Samuel Livingston Breese, November 1861"
