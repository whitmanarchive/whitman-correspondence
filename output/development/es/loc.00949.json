    "text": "Friday. Nov. 1st 1865.Dear Walt,Your letter was very welcome, and I have not forgotten you one day, though I have not written you. But I have been very much occupied in thought, as well as much of my time in going daily, & some days twice to see Miss Howard. Her sister Sallie has the worst form of typhoid fever. She has been very ill for three weeks, & alarmingly so for over ten days. Her mother was sent for more than a week ago, and two doctors have come twice a day to see her for many days. I don't suppose there is any hope at all. She is wild with delirium all the time. Poor Garrie is worn, but she bears up like a hero under it, does not leave her sister night or day. I got a good nurse for them, as their nurse had to leave.It is very sad, & I have not given up hoping till to-day, but she has no encouraging symptoms. I was so glad to hear that your little pet was better, and that your mother had got home! Has the little girl continued to improve? I hope so.It was good too, to hear that your mother was so well, & George, & all of you.I hope you are all well now. I trust the little girl is picking up fast.You ask about William. His letters have been \"few and far between\", four in five weeks,— but now I look a little for him to-morrow, Saturday, and shall surely expect him on Sunday. I guess he has had a good time, & he sent the MSS. to Curtis. You may see him in New York to-morrow. He will see Curtis, I suppose.When you come back what lots of things we shall have to talk about.I saw in the Tribune of Wednesday the advertisement of Drum Taps. Glad we were to see it, Charley & I.Have you sent one to Emerson? Do, in haste, won't you? I want him to have one right away.Dear Walt, will you see in New York Mr. Howells? I don't even know his address, & it is necessary that I should write him a business letter. I wonder how they are. Give him my love if you see him.Jeannie is well, & sends love. I am well, so is Charley, & he too, sends love. We all want to see you back.Mr. Ashton is well, but very busy, & looks worn. His wife is well, & I guess they will come soon.Give my love to your mother, & with much love to you - hoping soon to see you.Yours—Nelly. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 1 November 1865"
