    "text": "431 Stevens st.Street cor West. Camden, N.New Jersey. AugAugust 5.Dear Nelly,Your good letter came all right—it is pretty much \"the same subject continued\"—with my health & feelings—very grave depressions, alternated with more favorable spells—To-day, as I write, I am in good spirits & comparatively comfortable—after a painful attack last night—So it goes—What will be the finale remains to be seen. I await your further letters with some curiosity—(for strange as it may seem, men have that weakness as well as your sect)—I have to-day dispatched dear Mrs. Johnson's picture by mail—(It is intended to be put in a square gray or white mat with oval top, & then in a plain black walnut rustic square frame, with thin strip of gilt inside, & good plate glass)—I shall look for Charles Eldridge—My sister is spending a few weeks at Atlantic City—I am here, (declining several invitations) muchly but pleasantly, alone—We have a fine old Irish woman, (an old maid, not so very old either) who cooks nicely & runs the domestic machinery, for brothers George & Eddy, & self—She little knows how much good she does me with her great splendid coarse face & stout figure & warm-blooded & quaint & simple & affectionate ways—Write soon, Nelly dear—Walt. Walt Whitman to Ellen M. O'Connor, 5 August [1874]"
