I have not heard whether you rec'd the MS. book—I sent it hence by Adams' Express, last Friday afternoon. I remain ab't the same in health—as I write (Wednesday forenoon) it is cloudy and sufficiently cool here, & I am sitting by the open window downstairs as usual—am comfortable. I have of late-past been writing several pieces (as I believe I told you before) —they are to appear in time in N A Rev:—Century—& Lippincott's—have been paid for—W W Walt Whitman to William Sloane Kennedy, 18 August [1886]"
