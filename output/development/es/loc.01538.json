    "text": "Brooklyn, July 7, 1871Dear Pete,Well here I am still, pretty much the same thing, doing nothing & taking things easy. By your letter I see that you too are jogging along about the same, on your car, with an occasional let up—Often in my jaunts around the city, or on the bay, I wish you were with me, as you would enjoy it much—I have seen Mr. Hart, formerly of the Chronicle—he is about the same in appearance as formerly—Pete, I will not write much this time, as I am feeling somewhat dull and stupid this forenoon—We had a fine shower last night, and there is some breeze—but it is pretty warm and oppressive—Pete, here is a loving kiss for you, dear son, and much, much love for you, as ever, from your affectionate comrade & father—Walt. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 7 July 1871"
