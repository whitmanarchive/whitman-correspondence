    "text": "☞ $1.00 in John's book—fly leafBelmontMass.Jan. 7, 84 5 CEF. My Dear Whitman—I return the J. Burroughs Book. & the pamphlet with thanks. The Burroughs book fed me on my journey home, so that I had to buy no other reading.I shall cherish the memory of that blessed January 2nd '85 to the end of my days.My dear Whitman, I want you to regard me as a sort of son; tell me whenever I can do anything for you; let me loan you 5.00 if you get in a pinch, (& I have it). It is not always easy to borrow on real estate you know, or convenient I mean. & behave handsomely, & intimately & affectionately toward me.I am going to enclose a $1.00 between fly-leaves of the Burroughs' book as half pay for a copy of the new edition of yryour poems when it comes out. If it shdshould never come out, all right. I owe you $10. more anyway; for I got you to make me a present of yr books under false pretenses. I have not lectured on you more than once, & shall feel that I am a fraud until I have sent you $10. Say not a word.I know you are rich: all poets are. But I want you to have luxuries, now you are getting old.If this humbug government were worth a copper spangle it wdwould have settled a handsome pension on you—an honorary life salary—as a recognition of your unparalleled services during the war. But it wdwould probably be odious to you to even have the subject whispered of ? ?I found brave little wife well, & got a hearty welcome. Our pretty & remarkably smart cat died the day I returned—whereat tears & swelling breasts, & a private funeral.I must send you my N. Orleans articles. My Creole article in Lit. Wld. is paid for, but not out for 3 weeks.¶As is my paper entitled\"The New Ars Poetica\"if you can get a certain number of copies disposed of in advance, enough to cover expense (say $25 (?)) it wdwould be the means of my being able to publish it. Dr. Bucke will take a certain number, & I shall sell a few I suppose. WdWould 20 cts be too high a price for it?Let me know what success you have in the matter. But dont go to any trouble.AffAffectionatelyW. S. KennedyoverIt strikes me that it wdwould be better to write that essay or preface, & let it be published among yryour collected prose works say after yryour death—rather than put it before the poems themselves. I too have \"qualms\" about this latter. YrYour new poems will give value enough to the new edition.I believe you will stand stronger, Walt, if you stick to yryour old way of not explaining unless in a prose essay in a separate volume, as I said. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 7 January 1884"
