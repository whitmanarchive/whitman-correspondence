    "text": "Princeton, Mass.Nov 5, Y.L.101882Dear Sir–Knowing of your illness, through newspaper reports, I do not like to intrude anything upon you, but think perhaps you & those standing near you would like to know of the latest said on Leaves of Grass,– or rather on printed extracts from it— for which \"offence\" I was arrested by Anthony Comstock, Oct 26, & am held for trial (first-hearing), Nov. 16, in U.S. Court, 140 Tremont St. Boston, before Commissioner Henry L. Hallett. Nov 2, 1877, Comstock came as \"E. Edgewell,\" a Free Lover; this time he is a Labor Reformer, masked under three different aliases & telling a dozen lies to get what he calls evidence. As Mar 18, 1873 he wrote from Washing.[Washington] to furnish truth, ideas not brains to readers. I inclose[enclose] one of the slips– the bit of red–cloth which now enrages the United–States, ecclesiastical bull tearing towards us. Human language contains no finer type of manly sympathy for the supported \"fallen,\" no more impressive portraiture of the divinity of motherhood than is apparent in these two \"obsene\" poems. I inclose[enclose] also the Resolution accepted by the N.E. Free Love Convention in Boston last May, in which Dr. J.H. Savain, the old–time Anti–Slavery, Woman Suffrage, & Socialistic reformer read these two poems, to the people assembled, three times, at as many different sessions, as the most significant & interesting scriptures of these times presentable. Since my release, by President Hayes, Dec 19, 1878, from Dedham Jail, where I was serving out a two–years sentence for alleged–mailing a copy of my own book, Cupids Yokes, I was slowly becoming comparatively \"respectable\" again, when lo, suddenly, I am \"of no reputation\"! As a notable instance of what you call \"color–blindness\" I inclose[enclose] a clip, from the last Truth Seeker, written by Editor D.M. Bennett who himself served out a years sentence in Albany Penitentiary for alleged–mailing of Cupids Yokes. What have citizens done that they are afraid or ashamed now? I was glad to reprint–extended extracts from a Philadelphia paper, relative to your book, in Nov. Word & will send you it soon. As you doubtless know, your book is openly advertised in at least one Boston newspaper, Benj. R. Tucker, the editor of Liberty, inviting defying Oliver Stevens, Anthony Comstock, Postmaster Tobey or any other repressive Regulator of morals to order a copy which he promises to send by mail or otherwise deliver to any address! It is also freely sold on the streets by Josephine S. Tilton, the persistent Socialist once imprisoned for her Faith– many buying it indeed in bookstores & at news stands all over New England. Though the \"sealed order\" of events, which we all must obey, sent Comstock up here, to our Mountain– Home perch in the Air, to snatch me, a comparatively old jail–bird, first, Mr. Tucker, if they conceal me, will very likely next be \"elected\" as one of my fellow convicts in Dedham Jail. The end years in the form; rejoicing in the poetic fervor, the devine Afflatus which you incarnate I am ever your greatly indebted reader,Ezra H. Heywood Walt–Whitman Esq.Camden, N.J. Ezra Heywood to Walt Whitman, 5 November 1882"
