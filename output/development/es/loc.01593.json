    "text": "Providence, R. I.October 20, 1868Dear Charley,If the next Sunday Morning Chronicle contains a \"personal\" about me, would you do me the favor to get half a dozen copies, & keep for me? I shall doubtless return about the 26th—as my leave expires that day. (I wished to stay to vote, but have paired off with a vehement Seymourite, an old friend of mine.) I suppose Nelly received a letter I sent her yesterday, to your care.I am writing this in my room at Mr. & Mrs. Davis's. I came here yesterday, after three most agreeable days with Dr. Channing & Jeannie. As I write, we are expecting a call from William O'C. as he promised yesterday to come over & see Mrs. D. and myself, & spend an hour or two. This afternoon, after dinner, Mr. Davis whom I like, & get along with first rate, is going to take me out to ride, down to the Point, as I wish to see more of the harbor & bay. I am treated on all sides with the greatest hospitality & courtesy—& yet left just as free as I wish to be. It is beautiful fall weather to-day. I go back to New York & Brooklyn on Thursday next.I am profoundly impressed with Providence, not only for its charming locality & features, but for its proof & expression of fine relations, as a city, to average human comfort, life, & family & individual independence & thrift—After all, New England for ever!—(with perhaps just one or two little reservations)—With love to you, Charley—& repeated again to dear Nelly. Yours trulyWalt.P.S.—Later—2 o'clock—William & Dr. Channing have been over here—staidstayed to dinner—We had quite a gay time—indeed quite a little dinner party—William & Doctor, Mr & Mrs. Davis, Nora Perry, George Davis, Katy Hinds, & illustrious self—We are just through—Doctor has gone home, not wishing to leave Jeannie too long—William still remaining—I go presently on the drive with Mr. D.—and also to deposite this letter in P. O.W. Walt Whitman to Charles W. Eldridge, 20 October 1868"
