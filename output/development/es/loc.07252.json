    "text": "See notes Oct. 5th 1888Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,3 Oct. 1888I feel quite set up this evening, have just got your good long letter of 1st, \"The Melbourne Age\" from you which I wanted much and which I have written to Melbourne for, and, even better than these, a most encouraging letter from Osler. He says he finds you \"decidedly better\", \"brighter mentally and physically holding your own\",\"the pain\" he says points to \"nothing serious\" I think from what you say in yours of 1st that it was stomachic—dyspeptic—am glad to hear in any case that it is passing off—hope it will be quite gone before this reaches you. I am mighty glad (quite relieved indeed) to hear that the Oct. Century has the hospital piece—your way is now clear for \"N.B.\" We keep pegging away at the meter but it goes slow—still I hope to have things in such shape as that I shall have to go East inside of two weeks. By that time my Annual Report will be in and I shall be able to get off. This is the eighth day that we have had rain (sometimes snow also) every day—it is cold and dull but I am feeling quite serene—we are all keeping well and things look bright ahead.Love to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 3 October 1888"
