    "text": "Belmont | Dec. 5 '87Dear Friend:—I hope the Rhys brothers have not gone to the bottom! It begins to fill me with alarumalarm that we do not hear from the Croma in wh. he sailed. I went in H. Williams & Everetts this evening after work, & passed a few rapt moments in looking at the bust of you which is handsomely mounted on a polished wood tall pedestal standing on the middle landing of the stairs & just before a pier glass mirror—The very best position in the rooms. I then saw that I had not really seen it at all in the right way—before (I mean) it was on a pedestal & viewed at a distance. I gave it draining regards that fixed it in my mind. I regard it as a noble work, & am very glad of this rich honor done to my poet, & I want to congratulate Morse very heartily on it. It is a fine, nay a great, work, in my opinion.It seems to me that the chief traits that emerge are compassion blended with alert curiosity.I don't know whether it strikes others so, or whether you wdwould want these traits emphasized so much. I do see too, in some measure, the far forward look you spoke of in yryour good letter to me. But I think Morse might put more of the prophet or seer in it, or another one possibly.Mrs. Fairchild & her husband are going to drive out & see my Cox photo, some time.I suppose Baxter has written you that we have written to Bost. Pub. Lib.Boston Public Library about acceptance of bust. They have a little gallery of sculpture—as I now remember, & it will be a good place for it. Though I preferred the art museum. But Baxter likes to have his own way always.I must ask him about his Herald notice of it. For we must draw attention to it. He seems to have acted on Sidney M's suggestion abtabout Williams & Everett's being a better place than Chase's.WS. Kennedy William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 5 December 1887"
