    "text": "GlendaleAug 21st 1889Dear old friendI wonder how you are getting on this hot weather! I did hope that we were not going to have any very hot weather this Summer but the past two or three days have been very hot.I have thought of you so much & wondredwondered how you are geting[getting] on I should have written to you before this had I not heard from you through pap & Debbie. & Herbert comes down once in A while & we hear from you through him. I have been in Camden once or twice & should have called to see you but thought perhaps my coming would not be pleasant to you as we understood that you did not see only A few of your friends.I went to Marlton to day saw Harry & Eva they are all well. Harry Looks well he asked after you said he had called once or twice at your place some time Ago but couldnot see youI suppose you know that George Stafford has sold the old place at Kirkwood everything is changed there now. it's all laid out in Building lots & Avenues. & the old pond has become quite A pleasure resort. one cant go ther[there] now with-out meeting hundreds of peoplehow much we should like to see you with us once again but suppose that can never be. Its A pleasure to know that you are comfortableâ€”am glad to know that Mrs D & the nurse are kind I hope you will write to us sometime & tell us how you are geting[getting] onwith much love,S M Stafford Susan Stafford to Walt Whitman, 21 August 1889"
