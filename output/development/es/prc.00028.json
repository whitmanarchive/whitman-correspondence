    "text": "Washington, Sept.September 2, 1872. Dear Mr. Tennyson,After a long absence in the mountains & lakes of Vermont & northern New York, I am now back again at work, & expect to remain here. Your letter of May 23d, also the one with the picture, safely reached me. The picture is superb, & I consider myself in luck, possessing it. It brings you very near me. I have it now before me. I send you, by same mail with this, in a little book, my piece lately delivered for Dartmouth College commencement, up north. Did Democratic Vistas reach you? We have had, in this country, a summer more fit for the infernal regionsâ€”but now the delicious Virginia September has set in, balmy cool, & one dilates & feels like work again. With best respects & love,Walt WhitmanMy address continues the same, Solicitor's Office Treasury, Washington, D.C. Walt Whitman to Alfred, Lord Tennyson, 2 September 1872"
