    "text": "[London, Ont.,]4 April [188]9Your card of 2d to hand. I am quite distressed, unhappy, about that villainous cold of yours. A real good sweat by means of an alcohol bath or otherwise, if you could manage it, would be the thing for you. Send for your Camden Dr and see if it cannot be arranged. A lovely spring day here—snow nearly all gone now. [—] Willy Gurd is in N.Y. at present, will go to Danbury about Saturday. The Inspector is to be here this evening at 8.10—every thing is lively with us—wish things were more lively with you and I am determined I will make them a little more lively for you whenever this meter business comes to a prosperous issue as I think it must before many months—I am thinking of you all the time \"and don't you forget it.\"Love to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 4 April [188]9"
