J.Sir:Though I can claim no relationship, owing to the similarity of our names, I write to you hoping to gain a few lines from you in reply. I am a native Texan, but my father belonged to the Georgia branch of the Whitman family. His name is Mertice J. Whitman and for several years he has been practicing law at Rusk, Texas.Last May, I was appointed a Naval Cadet and since that time I have been in the U. S. Naval Academy.Hoping you will not think me too presumptuous in daring to write to you,I am,yours respectfully,Walter B. Whitman Walter B. Whitman to Walt Whitman, 3 August 1889"
