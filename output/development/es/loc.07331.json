    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeAsylum for the InsaneOntarioLondon, Ont.,7 Jan 1890I have your note of last Saturday and Sunday enclosing McKenzie's note and Carpenter's photo. The latter is good and very welcome. That piece on \"Old Poets &c\" ought to be good. There is one \"old poet\", at least, whom you shd know about by this time. I fear you are not having a good time, old friend, with that miserable stupid feeling all the time. We too here are having quite a time of our own. Something like 60 or 70 per cent of the (so called) sane people about the institution more or less sick. 2 out of the 4 doctors in bed nearly every one at my house sick. (But nothing dangerous about the disease so we can afford to laugh at it). Wm Gurd has been here a week sick all the time, still quite sick tho out of bed and on the mend. If \"La Grippe\" attacks the patients (a few of them have it now) in the same percentage as the employees we have a cheerful time ahead of usLove to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 7 January 1890"
