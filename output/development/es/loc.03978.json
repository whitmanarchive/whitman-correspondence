    "text": "Woodbury N.J.New JerseyAugAugust 14, 1877,Dear Walt,I have wrote to father and now I think that I will write to you and let you know how it goes with me. I like the place very well but it is dry here I not knowing any one and have no one to put me through the mill (as the saying is:) it is hard to get along. The folkesfolks are very nice but most too perticular[particular], but it is the way of some to be that way you know. When you get up to Camden it will be better for me for I then will have some place to go. I want to get up to see you once a week at least and have a good time, for I cant let my selfe[myself] out here they are too mild for that. The old Gent asked me if I was a member of Church and I toled[told] him I was not and he seemed disappointed but hearing that I was not, he then asked me if I went to church and I toled[told] him that I did sometimes watwhat church I went to and I said I was not of any denomination and he then asked me if father was a church member and I did not know what to tell him, but I got through with it and he said that he would set me at work after dinner so that was the way I spent the first day.Your truly,Harry StaffordWrite soon. Yours Harry Stafford to Walt Whitman, 14 August 1877"
