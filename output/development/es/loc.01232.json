    "text": "Leeds8. April 1876Dear friend,EdwdEdward Carpentersent books April 25 by mail one set of bookssent, & rec'dTwo sets ‑ sentMany thanks for your two enclosures of printed extracts &c. I wrote to Mr. Buchanan about his plan of forming a society for the circulation of your works, but he has not given me very definite information of what is intended; meanwhile for the time I have been absorbed by the news of the death of one of my brothers in India. This brings with it the additional pains to me that it will probably prevent my intended journey to the States this Summer. I had made all arrangements and was carried forward on the hope of seeing you, and now I am greatly disappointed.I must ask instead that you will send me your two volumes when ready—two copies of each—I am anxious to see them. Please forward them as soon as you can to me at 45 Brunswick Square, Brighton.I have got a P.O.O for £4 whwhich I enclose; I was trusting to what I think Robert Buchanan said that £1 was the price per vol., but I do not feel sure this is right as $5 would be more than that. However you will let me know if there is any excess due to you & I will forward the sum.It is difficult for us in England to know what is the truth among all the conflicting reports. I hope that the latest namely that you are not suffering from any immediate want is the right one, this I feel that you must often be under some pressure of difficulty. Of one thing I am sure—from internal evidence so to speak—namely that your books have never been a source of profit to you‑tho' they may have been to othersFor the present, farewell. Yr.Yourunforgetful friendEdward Carpenter Edward Carpenter to Walt Whitman, 8 April 1876"
