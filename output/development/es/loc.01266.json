    "text": "431 Stevens street Camden New Jersey U S AmericaJan: 19 '84Dear Sir This item— A new edition of Walt Whitman's works, has been brought out in London, with an appendix containing the opinions of George Eliot, Ruskin, Tennyson, Swinburne, Rossetti and others concerning Whitman. is printed in the papers here of late—I suppose fictitious information—But I thought I would write to you to ask if you know or have heard. Is it not a mistake for the Wilson & McCormick edition, (from the plates here)?—But that has no \"appendix\" as mentioned above. I am well as usual—Dr Bucke was down from Canada a short time since to see me. I get the \"Record\" from your establishment, & thank you. Walt WhitmanJosiah Child | c/o Trübner & Co Walt Whitman to Josiah Child, 19 January 1884"
