    "text": "Burlington VermontNov 2, 1884.BroBrother Walt,Han is certainly better, although fluctuating in her condition. I essayed to drive with her yesterday but was compelled to return. Some nights she does not sleep, at others sleeps well. She is about the house this morning: little appetite. She keeps your letters close by her: she cannot read much, or endure reading or talking. Dr Lund is attending her steadily; he is a good physician: Asks no fee, but I shall pay him in my way. I have used a portion of the money sent to Han, which I shall repay—to help get a frame. I have numerous good paintings, but money is scarce. I have to meet my annual interest next week 15 dollars; that paid I shall have a year before me to housekeeping.I washed our sheets yesterday, with Siddalls Soap nicely. I shall have a strange and instructing history to report some day probably, but I have saved in household service and other ways, over 60 dollars.I shall continue as I am[:] our condition, of course is current through the town.C L Heyde— Charles Louis Heyde to Walt Whitman, 2 November 1884"
