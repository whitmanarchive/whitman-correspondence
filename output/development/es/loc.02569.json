BROOME ST.New York, Mar 14 1887Dear Uncle Walt:Over two weeks ago I determined to let Major Pond manage your lecture.He is \"up\" in that kind of business and knew just how to do it. He paid I might calculate $350, as the cost—the output, and he would guarantee to fill a hall. I at once assumed the responsibility & became security for the $350— He then tried to get Chickering Hall but it was engaged for April 14th & also for every afternoon & evening about that date. We have at last settled upon the Madison Square Theater for the afternoon (4 o'clock) of April 14. I must pay the $75. for the Theater the moment it is engaged, & I will do so, the moment I receive a telegram from you tomorrow saying \"all right, go ahead.\"Please wire me at once on receipt of this. Alma is here with me & is well & says \"Lots of love & thanks for the nice letter rec'dreceived at Equinunk\" —Ever yours Sincerely,J H Johnston John Johnston to Walt Whitman, 14 March 1887"
