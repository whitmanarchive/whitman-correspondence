    "text": "ans'dJan; 6th 1887.Friday.12 Well RoadHampstead LondonEnglandMy dear Walt: I send you three pounds ￡3. the sum being Miss R.E. Powell's (Piccard's Rough, St Catherine's Guildford) annual subscription to the Free-Will-offering—sent to Mr. Rossetti in form of a cheque, but he sent it on to me to post to you; I should be very glad to see these annual subscriptions increase. I wonder who wrote the long articles about you in the Pall Mall Gazette? I have had a good amicable letter from Dr. Bucke—what a thoroughly good-natured chap he is! It is foggy with us; too foggy to paint! though I and Grace had a little skating on the 'Club Pond' this morning. I am getting ready my pictures (2) for the spring Exhibition. My Book is getting near though not quite through the press: In one of the last chapters, I added, at the last minute, &, to speak, some gossips or \"cracks\", as the Scotch say, this I exchanged with you down at the Creek under the Walnut tree: when you are writing again, tell me how Mrs. Stafford is will you Walt?With best love to the dear old fellow, fromHerbert H. Gilchrist. Herbert H. Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 6 January 1887"
