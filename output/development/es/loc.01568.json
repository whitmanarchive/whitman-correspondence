    "text": "Messrs. Routledge: Publishers BroadwayDear Sirs:By your note of 18th, from New York, just received, I find that Mr. Edmund Routledge, editor, would (I quote) like to keep & use an original poem—three-page poem—sent him from me, but demurs to my first-asked price—that he directs you to offer me 10 pounds—which you can send me, $50: in gold—and that, (the terms being settled, &c.) he will advertise it very largely. I accept the terms offered—$50 in gold—and you can forward me the am't as soon as convenient. I repeat, that I distinctly reserve the right of printing the piece in a future edition of my poems. Sending best wishes & respects to editor & publishers, I remain. Walt Whitman to George Routledge & Sons, 19 February 1868"
