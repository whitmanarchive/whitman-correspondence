    "text": "London,Ontario,Canada19. Sep 1891 My dear Walt Whitman, A lovely & perfect day here,—air fresh & sweet with pleasant breezes. Immediately after I wrote to you yesterday afternoon the sky became suddenly overspread with storm clouds of wonderful beauty, & presently the rain began to pour & a thunderstorm began. It was all over by tea time & the evening was clear & beautiful—the bursts of cumulus cloud on the Eastern horizon glowing with colours & effects as Dr. & I walked across to the office in the evening. A pleasant evening, with delightful talks with Dr. He showed me a letter from you. We were both very much pleased to hear per H.L.T. of Dr. Longaker's report. Glad to hear, too, that the oculist's report was favourable. I have spent today very idly—giving the reins to my mood. But I have thoroughly enjoyed the perfect beauty & freshness of the day. I was at the office a short time this morning & was very pleased to receive a parcel of papers addressed to me by you. Thank you for your constant kindness & thought. The Dr. showed me the copy of \"The Literary World\" rec'd from you, with the marked par. on \"Good Bye\" which I was pleased to read. Since dinner I have looked through the two papers you sent, & dipped into the pamphlet on \"Swedenborg.\" This last, however, I will put aside for another time. Dr. is calling for me at 3 o'clock to go to town, so I write this brief note in the hope that I may post it there. I hope that the day is equally beautiful with you, & that you are fairly well. How it would please me to hear that you have been out for a drive again! Give my affectionate regards to Mrs. Davis & Warry. With love to yourself as always J.W. WallaceJ.W.W. James W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 19 September 1891"
