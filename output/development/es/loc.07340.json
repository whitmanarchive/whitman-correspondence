    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeAsylum for the InsaneOntarioLondon, Ont.,16 Feb 1890All quiet here.I have been looking over Browning's last volume this morning—\"Asolando\". I like it—it is good stuff. After W.W. he is the \"grand optimist\": That is to say (in one very important respect) the grand man.Still no winter and I have about given up all idea of getting ice from our own waters here—it is a remarkable season—as \"Tennesee's Partner\" says \"I disremember anything like it.\" The amount of sickness and the number of deaths have been unprecedented. I guess however we are over the worst of it.I have just had dinner and am going out to the chapel (in five minutes) to attend Catholic service—AffectionatelyR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 16 February 1890"
