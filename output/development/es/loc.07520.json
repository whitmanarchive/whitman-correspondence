The copy is ready—it is all printed matter—(or nearly all)—is all plain sailing—you could commence next Monday—Sh'd want liberal proofs—You can talk with Horace Traubel just the same as you w'd with me—I am almost entirely disabled ab't walking, or bodily locomotion—Walt Whitman328 Mickle StreetCamden NJ Walt Whitman to Mr. Bennerman, 22 May 1888"
