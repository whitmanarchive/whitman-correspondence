    "text": "56 Euston Sq.London, N.W.9 July /71.Dear Mr. Whitman,I was much obliged to you for the kind thought of sending me your fine verses on the Parisian catastrophes. My own sympathy (far unlike that of most Englishmen) was very strongly with the Commune—i.e. with extreme, democratic, & progressive republicanism, against a semi–republicanism wh.[which] may at any moment (& will, if the ultras don't make the attempt too dangerous) degenerate into some form of monarchy exhibiting more or less the accustomed cretinism.I fancy that, unless some one[someone] sends it you from here, you may probably not see an article on your position as a poet lately published in the Westminster Review. I therefore take the liberty of posting this article to you. I don't know who has written it: but incline to think the writer must be Edward Dowden, Professor of English Literature in Trinity College, Dublin—a young man no doubt has a good literary career before him. He is at any rate, I know, one of your most earnest admirers. Lately he delivered at the College a lecture on your poems, with much applause I am told: & the same week some one else in Dublin delivered another like lecture. There are various highly respectful references also to your poetry in a work of some repute recently published here, \"Our Living Poets,\" by Forman (dealing directly with English poets only).You may perhaps be aware that the Westminster Review is a quarterly, forwarded by Jeremy Bentham, & to this day continuing to be the most advanced of the English reviews as regards liberal politics & speculation.I trust Mr. O'Connor is well: wd.[would] you please to remember me to him if opportunity offers.Believe me with reverence & gratitude.Your friend,W. M. Rossetti William Michael Rossetti to Walt Whitman, 9 July 1871"
