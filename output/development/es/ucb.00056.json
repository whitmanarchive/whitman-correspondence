    "text": "2316 Pine StreetSt Louis MissouriSunday afternoon NovNovember 23Dear friendI am still here—not yet (as an old Long Island aunt used to say) \"not yet out of my misery\" but I go out on the streets, or to the Public Library, most every day, & have no doubt I shall be as well as usual before long—I believe I told you I was in nice quarters & very comfortable here—I send you Mrs Gilchrist's letter, which you needn't return—Gilder's, which I also enclose, I wish you to send back, some time—Upon receiving this, post me a card—tell me how the mother is & 'Sula, also the baby, also Smith—Just got a postal from Mrs Gilchrist giving her address.1 Elm Villas Elm RoadHeath street HampsteadLondon Eng:EnglandThe rough map enclosed gives you some idea of my present jaunt, on the red line (the blue lines are old travels of mine)—I have seen the December Scribner's—What you say of me in Nature & the Poets thoroughly delights, satisfies & prides me—I saw in the Library a late London Fortnightly in which J A Symonds, touching briefly but very commendingly & mentioning my name, makes quite an extract from Dem[ocratic] Vistas (summing up the general spirit of British literature as being markedly sombre & bilious)—A B Alcott is expected here, to talk—I may see him—This is quite a place for the most toploftical Hegelian transcendentalists, a small knot but smart—the principal of them, W T Harris, editor of Speculative Philosophy, has been often to see me, has been very kind, & I like him much—Probably ten days more will end my stay here, (but I am not fixed)—A fine day as I write, & I am feeling comfortable. Best love to 'Sula—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 23 November [1879]"
