Herald a few days ago regarding your misfortune. I wish to say I should like to subscribe to your forthcoming book (as I understand through the press you are about to publish one.)I often think of a passage in your \"Leaves of Grass\" when you say it is wonderful how we \"affect each other without ever seeing each other\" and have sometimes felt an almost irresistible impulse to come where you are and talk with you face to face.I think you will understand my motive well enough to think this emanates from a sincere feeling of admiration of your genius. of all the original writers (if there be such thing as an original writer) I think you are the most original. You have inspired me with thoughts most sublime to myself and I devoutly thank you accept this humble tribute in the same spirit which has prompted it is the wish of your devoted admirerC.W. HineP.S. will you be so kind as to reply to this giving me the much desired information regarding your forthcoming book &câ€”and much oblige.
