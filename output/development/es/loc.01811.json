    "text": "MayburyWorking StationSurreyEnglandNov 3 1871My dear sir, I send by this mail the second part of my study of your works. I hope I may not unintentionally have misrepresented you, but if I could be one of the means of drawing more general attention to your great works than they have yet received in this country, I believe I should have done somet'gsomething worth the doing.May I venture to hope I may have a line from yourself when you have time? And may I again repeat the hope I expressed to you in a former note when I sent you my own vol. of poems—the first—of which I am rather ashamed of now—on account of its Byronism—& too much leaven of aristocracy which is born with me—that you will not visit this country without coming to us? Yours with much respect& in all sincerityRoden NoelI want to get hold of the American Ed. of your work—which was lent me by Buchanan but I understand it is difficult to procure.The proclamation of comradeship seems to me the grandest and most momentous fact in your work & I heartily thank you for it.Walt Whitman Esq Roden Noel to Walt Whitman, 3 November 1871"
