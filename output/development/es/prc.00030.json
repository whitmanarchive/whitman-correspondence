Camden, N.New Jersey, Dec.December 2—2 p.m.Dear friend,The address I want you to send the Tax & Revenue books, reports, documents, or whatever to is To Paul LiptayCare of Otto Behrens140 Eighth avenueNew York City I wrote to Nelly about a week ago, stating my condition, & what a plight I have been in—& am partially yet—though slowly coming round to what I was just previous—The doctor still comes every day—rather a curious fellow—a great bully, vehement, loud words & plenty of them (the very reverse of my valued Dr Drinkard)—& yet I value what he says & does for me—He is inclined to think the seat of all my woe has been (what no one ever whispered before,) the liver, acted upon largely also, perhaps almost primarily, thro[ugh] the emotional nature—at any rate he is decided that the present botherations are absolutely liver troubles, & their radiations—Charley, I have had a sick, sick three weeks since you were here—havn'thaven't been out, except just in front of the house in the sun, & only three times that—but don't be alarmed, my dear friend—the probabilities are, (in my opinion any how,) that I shall get partially well yet— Walt Whitman to Charles W. Eldridge, 2 December [1874]"
