    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylum for the Insane,London, Ont.,16 June 1889A sleepy, cloudy, warm, dull, balmy June day. A day to sit on the verandah and dream of old friends and old times. The syringas and roses are beginning to come out and the best of the seasons will soon be here. I should have taken a long drive in the country somewhere today but that the Inspector is still here so I stay around in case I might be required. We are all well and all goes well and quietly. I had a line from Horace he thinks the little book he is at work upon will be quite an important affair and I think likely it will be so. I hope it will soon be printed so I can have a look over itâ€”send me an early copyLove to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 16 June 1889"
