    "text": "Kirkwood N.J.November 27th 1877Dear friend Walt:I arrived home last night at about 7 PM, and I was feeling bad and I was going slow but the horses did not like it much they wanted to troottrot all the way home, they felt good I guess, they have not been doing much for a couple of weeks or more, so they wanted to show off, you know how it is your self when you feel like licking me; but I held them down as I do you, when you feel that way. I have a kind of a cold from comeingcoming up yesterday good other ways. Father is a little better today than he was yesterday, but he looks very badly yet. Debbie & Joe got home about 9. OK., they were over to Philadelphia after they left over to Swartse's, from what I hear them say. Ed and I went over to Glendale to church Sunday ev.evening, they had distracted meeting (as I call) it over there, there was 3 up seeking theretheir souls salvation. It looks as if the rain was not over with yet, and the \"rooster\" is crowing, (that is a sure sign) they say.When I saw you on Federal St., yesterday, I thought you did not look very well, what was the matter with you? did you not feel as well as usual? Ben is not collecting today and it seems lonlylonely here without him here. I don't have any one to talk too unless he is here, everything is as still as the dead of night, not a sound reaches my ear and the ticking of the clock appears to be almost looking out of the store window over here. I wonder what his thoughts are about; there the click of the register has broken the stillness of the place, it seems like the presence of an old and loving friend, it is telling of the death of a man out in the st of OriganOregon, I don't know to who: but here comes a fellow around now he saissays put in a word for him he is blaguarding me, let him crack away, I will have to close.Ever yoursHarry Staffordwrite soon come down when you feel or good bye Harry Stafford to Walt Whitman, 27 November 1877"
