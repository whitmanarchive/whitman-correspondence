    "text": "Washington, D.C.Life-Saving Service,January 3, 1888.Dear Walt:A Happy New Year!I send you the article on Mrs Gilchrist's book from the Nation, for which I have never ceased hunting, and which I found where it had no business to be. You will observe that the holy Father sprinkles us with an aspergillus full of ice water. The cold impudence of that Nation surpasses.Sometime when you are sending you can return me the article for my collection.I have for some time wanted to write to you, but have been strangely ill, and only just able to walk through the office duties. I keep up my spirits as well as I can, but find it all pretty depressing.The article by the wretch named Willard in the American Magazine filled me with indignation. What a beast a man must be who comes to you with a letter of introduction, and goes off to caricature and lampoon you in a magazine!I hope you have read \"King Solomon's Mines.\" It is immense. I have read it forty times, I do believe. The battle chapters let one into the spirit of Homer as the translations cannot do. I wish somebody would rightly review it for the benefit of the Boston school.I see the little pieces you send forth. \"Yonnondio\" is beautiful. The Boston Advertiser, which also has for you an aspergil of ice-water, copied it, which is an act of tribute.â€”I think your term, \"Shakespeare-Bacon,\" will stick to Verulam. Donnelly is, I guess, in England, getting out his English edition. I have not heard from him since October, and await his movements on tiptoe.I hope you are keeping reasonably well. Au revoir.Always affectionatelyWDO'ConnorWalt Whitman. William D. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 3 January 1888"
