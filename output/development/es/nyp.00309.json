Dearest mother,I am about the same to-day, rather on the improve—have not tried to get out any more—feel pretty much depressed about Mat's death, (but it has been to her no doubt a relief from great pain)—Have just written a few lines to Jeff—Wrote yesterday to Han—Mother, you must not get gloomy. Feel better as I write—I am sitting up by the stove. Walt Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 21 February [1873]"
