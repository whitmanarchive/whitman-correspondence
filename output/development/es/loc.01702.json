    "text": "sent in steamerJan 27, '72J. A. Symonds,Not knowing whether it will reach you, I will however write a line to acknowledge the receipt of your beautiful & elevated \"Love & Death,\" and of the friendly letter from you, of October 7th last. I have read & re-read the poem, & consider it of the loftiest, strongest & tenderest. Your letter was most welcome to me. I should like to know you better, & I wish you to send me word should this reach you—if the address is the right one. I wish to forward you a copy of my book—as I shall presently bring out a new edition. I am, as usual, in good health, and continue to work here in Washington in a government office, finding it not unpleasant—finding, in it, indeed sufficient and free margin.Pray dontdon't think hard of me for not writing more promptly. I have thought of you more than once, & am deeply touched with your poem. Walt Whitman to John Addington Symonds, 27 January 1872"
