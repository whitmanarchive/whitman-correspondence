    "text": "Walt,Dinner hour. I loafing in a Lumber Yard at foot of 35, Jr. Under the shadow of a pile of lumber and setting on a lower pile—Opposite and close to me at the pier head a Banquet In the fore rigging flapping lazily in the summer breeze are a few sailors clothes From the galley pipe between the main & foremast issues a Cloud of smoke.—One of the men in blue shirt and bare? footed has just come from aloft where he has been loosening the Mainsail which seems to be wet. He has now gone below I Suppose to his dinner—On the opposite side of the river MsrBgh.Mister Burroughs between The Ever plying ferryboats, the trip, the Harlem Boats. And mingled with the splash of the paddle whack, the murmur of the Sailors at dinner.—the lazy flap of the sails, the screech of the steam whistle of the tugs the laugh and wrangle of the boys on swimming comes a remembrance of thee dear Walt With MsrBghs.Mister Burroughs & Brooklyn, with the ferries and the vessels with the Lumber piles and the docksFrom among all out of all Connected with all and yet distinct from all arises thee Dear Walt—Walt my life has turned out a poor miserable failure. I am not a drunkard nor a teetotaler—I am neither honest or[nor] dishonest I have my family in Brooklyn and am supporting them—I never stole robbed, cheated nor defrauded, any person out of anything, and yet I feel that I have not been honest to myself— my family nor my friendsOne Oclock, the Banquet is laden with Coal and the carts have comeThe old old Poems Walt. The cart backs up, the bucket comes up full and goes down Empty. The men argue and swear. The wind blows the coal dust over man & beast and now it reaches me.
