I have been very busy and shall write but little this time as I must go once to a place called West Jersey about ten miles from here to see about buying a house and lot but do not think that because I write but little I am tired of writing to you or wish to stop corresponding with you for I know of no one's letters that are looked for and read with more interest than yours, now that Mary has come. She came down on tuesday[Tuesday] she is well though tired when she arrived she sends her love to you give my respects to all friends and write soon I will write again soon yours ever Elijah Douglass Fox to Walt Whitman, 24 December 1863"
