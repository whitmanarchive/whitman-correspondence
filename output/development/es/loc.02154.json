    "text": "CamdenFeb: 27 '83Your good words (Jan 27–Feb 13) just rec'dreceived. Of course does me good to hear from you—(that anecdote of Lady Dilke too pleased me)—Every thing goes on pretty much the same with us here in Camden—my sister quite up to her standard of health—not plus, but not minus either—my brother a little on the plethoric, & a little more minus than is desirable, but goes forth as usual every day—is building a house for their own occupancy on the little farm at Burlington—I go out quite a good deal as guest to a charming Quaker family, R Pearsall Smith & Mrs Smith at Germantown—a son & two fine daughters—dear friends all—have fine drives—the elder daughter, 20, is a great reader of L of G.My books doing—L. of G. sales have been good—Specimen Days not so good yet, but I am satisfied. (Wilson & McCormick, St. Vincent St. Glasgow, are publishing S D for the British market)—Dr Bucke's book is in the hands of the printers here (PhilaPhiladelphia) & is to be published by David McKay, 23 South 9th St. PhilaPhiladelphia. Will be out in three or four weeks. The Vols.Volumes of Carlyle's and Emerson's Letters are out here (Boston)—I have just glanced at them—I suppose you recdreceived \"the Bible as Poetry\" in the \"Critic\"—I don't know where I shall flit to the coming summer—if I am well enough—Even as I write I receive a letter from John Burroughs, & will just enclose it—dontdon't want it again—(not as promising as I could wish)—if you can lay hands on the last Century (March) read J. B's piece—I think very fine—best love to you—& to dear Herb, and dear Giddy—The Staffords are all well—I havn'thaven't been down there in some months, but am going.W W Walt Whitman to Anne Gilchrist, 27 February 1883"
