    "text": "BostonNov 16 1866Mr W. WhitmanDear SirI own the Stereotype plates of your Poem, \"Leaves of Grass\" I bought them of the assigness of Thayer & Eldridge at the time of their failure. I should like to sell them & did not know but you would like to purchase if you could get them at the right figure. I do not know what they cost, but my impression is, that it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $800. I would be pleased to have you state what you would give for them, or to know if you could refer me to any publisher who would be likely to purchase. I think you could make better arrangements with publishers if you owned the Stereotype platesYours ResptlyRespectfullyH. Wentworth Horace Wentworth to Walt Whitman, 16 November 1866"
