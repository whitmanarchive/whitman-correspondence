    "text": "WashingtonTuesday afternoon Aug. 27. Dearest mother,There is nothing particular for me to write about. I am well as usual, and getting along all right, except the hot weather. That continues here without much let up—Mother, I hope the things have arrived by this time, & that you have got your bed fixed. I have had a visitor to–day & yesterday, a young Hungarian gentleman, quite agreeable, talks English well, quite a traveler—went over to the White House with him yesterday, & went all through—the President & family are away, but Gen. Dent conducted us through, & was very polite. Mrs. O'Connor made me a call Saturday, & John Burroughs to–day—Mother dear, as soon as I hear from you, I will write more particular about my coming to Camden for a day or two. Mother, I shall probably send the order in my next.Walt— Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 27 August [1872]"
