    "text": "An Illustrated Magazine of Entertaining Reading.Published MonthlyOFFICE OF THE GALAXYNo. 39 Park Row,New York, May 15 1868My dear Sir:After thinking over your article for several days, & consulting with Mr. Sheldon (who of course has no editorial control over The Galaxy, but whose opinion in courtesy I am bound to regard) I am obliged to come to the conclusion that for the present at least, it is best that it should not be printed in The Galaxy. The July number for which it was ded ought to be a light number for Summer reading: this is an article that requires thought; cannot be read on cars &c, & ought to appear in soberer weather.But lest you should wish to use it elsewhere immediately I return the MS. in a separate package.I regret that there has been any delay in reaching this conclusion, but the question could not be decided hastily, in justice to you.I amVery truly yoursF. P. ChurchMr Walt Whitman Francis P. Church to Walt Whitman, 15 May 1868"
