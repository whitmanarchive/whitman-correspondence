    "text": "see notes March 12 1889July 14th 1885A. Thorndike RiceRice, A.T.THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW,New York.Editorial Department.Walt Whitman EsquireMy Dear Sir:I take pleasure in soliciting your literary cooperation in an enterprise which has been conducted with great success since the beginning of the year. A number of important American newspapers, among which may be mentioned such as the New York Tribune, Philadelphia Press, Detroit Post, Chicago Times, St. Paul Pioneer Press etc. have agreed to combine in receiving for their Sunday Editions articles arranged for and edited by me, to be written by distinguished authors, scientists, travellers, and men of affairs on both sides of the Atlantic. Many eminent contributors in Europe and America have already written, and many others have promised to write. The papers in which these articles are published reach nearly two millions of the most intelligent people of the country. The aim is that these papers should be as far as possible of a bright and popular character '(even when treating of serious topics) such as would interest the reader of newspapers and magazines; and I sincerely hope you will find it consistent with your obligations to give me your literary assistance. I should like a paper from you at your very earliest leisure about 3000 words in length and leave the subject somewhat to yourself, only asking that it shall be of a popular character. I shall be glad to send you an honorarium of $50 for such a paper. Hoping to hear from you very soon and that you can give me the article at once, I remain, Yours Very TrulyA. Thorndike Rice Jr. Charles Allen Thorndike Rice to Walt Whitman, 14 July 1885"
