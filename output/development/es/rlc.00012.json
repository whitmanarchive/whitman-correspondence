    "text": "July 28, 1874. Yours of June 26 duly arrived some days since. 1) I have sent a paper to Kr. Elster at Throudhjem, containing my last, (the College poem) & a piece in about my sickness. I sent you a copy same paper. 2) The letter you speak of, (March 20,) duly reached me. I have no doubt, dear friend, that all the letters, papers, sheets, &c. during the last three years sent me by your loving kindness & attention have every one reached me. (The post office here is among the best things of the New World—is sure, quick, cheap, & every way admirable. If letters addressed to me go to other cities, as they sometimes do, they are pretty sure eventually to come here—the post office men, even the carriers, are wonderfully bright & intuitive.) 3) I will be on the look out for John Burroughs's photograph—he is well at last accounts. 4) I myself have pleased myself more fully with Redwood Tree than any of my pieces of late years. But it is generally thought wild & cloudy here—(the Columbus is more popular far)—I suppose it is hardly necessary to tell you that I have pitched and keyed my pieces more with reference to fifty years hence, & how they will stand mellowed and toned then—than to pleasing & tickling the immediate impressions of the present hour. 6) I have not heard any thing more of C. Petersen lately—but if I meet with any thing of his printed, I will send you. 7) All the criticisms, Danish papers, & those from Norway, duly rec'dreceived—to be carefully translated & read to me—I prize them all, very much—but I am yet feeble, & read, write &c. as little as possible. 8) One or two little items have been in the papers here about the Fremblik translation. I get along with your English very well indeed—W. W.431 Stevens st. Camden, N. Jersey. U. S. America Aug. 28, '74Rudolf Schmidt My dear friend,Your letter of July 28, from Gaûsdal, in \"old Norway\" reached me to-daytoday. Quite curiously, on the very same day, I was writing to you—as per sheet accompanying, written at date (a month ago) but not sent until I could add further. I am glad to get your letter from Norway—am still laid up sick & lonesome here—do not seem to get any thing like well, & at times the prospect is very uncertain—yet maintain a steady heart. I was dismissed from my clerkship under Government at Washington about two months ago. I write this by my open window—the majestic & beautiful Delaware flows near, in sight—we have had a fine summer in America—& now a spell of rich, golden, mellow weather—far & near wonderful crops of every thing—now beginning to be gathered. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Rudolf Schmidt, 28 July–28 August 1874"
