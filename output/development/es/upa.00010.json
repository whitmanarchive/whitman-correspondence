    "text": "Esopus N.Y.Feb 25, 1883Dear Walt: I wrote to your Quaker friends thanking them for the invitation for the 22d. I could not have gone in any case, my wife was ill in bed & I had to go to Delaware CoCounty to examine a bank, Ursula (the wife) Ursula was ill in N.Y. She had a relapse after returning home, & has had a hard time,—ague, bronchitis, & a gathering in her ear. She is better now & is down stairs to-day for the first in nearly two weeks. My own health is nothing to brag of, I thought the trouble was with my nervous system, but the doctor finds it in my arterial; arteries hard & brittle, danger from apoplexy &c. Not a very cheering diagnosis tho', I may live to be hanged yet. I have given up eating meat & have otherwise changed my habits—shall probably go out home in the spring & spend the season on the old home farm. I seem to have felt a shadow creeping over me for some years, & this is what it means. But I shall not lose heart: I shall try to gain some of your own cheerfulness & serenity. I wish much I could see you. If you had only sent me word that day, I was on the point of coming over, but felt sure I should miss you if I did. I received your check for $100 all right. I have a little glimpse of Carlyle & his country in the March Atlantic. I hope you keep well. Is there any news from Boston about the effort to stop the sale of your poems? With much loveJohn Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 25 February 1883"
