It is not intended to be a study or an elaborate review simply a good word which will allay if possible some of the antagonism which still exists toward your work. I shall do more of course but this little notice has its work to do. I send copies to Mr. Howells and to Mr. Burroughs. I hope you are feeling as well as when you last wrote.—I saw Judge Chamberlain and other of our friends today—Called on O'Reilly but he was out. hope to see him soon. I hope to do something specially useful for you by and by.—Baxter has returned from Europe I shall see him in a day or two at his home.Steadfastly,Hamlin Garland Hamlin Garland to Walt Whitman, 16 November 1888"
