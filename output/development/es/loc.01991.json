    "text": "SyracuseSept 15th Sunday 1867.Dear FriendWalt WhitmanI know that you will not think I have forgotten you by my long silence for I have been waiting patiently for more than four months for an answer to my last letter to you which was written some time in April, but I presume you have not received it. How will I remember the kind face that we used to look for at, Armory Square Hospital.I spent a week in New York City in June, my Wife was taken sick there while visiting her Sister and they sent for me to come.I am at work at the same business that I was when I wrote to you last, Piano Forte and Melodeon work.We have been drove quite hard with work this Summer and I have got pretty tired but there is no rest for us yet.What do you think of the policy of President Johnson. I am inclined to think he is as big a traitor as Jeff Davis, and I am in hopes that when Congress meets that they will go on with the impeachment.The weather is getting quite cool here now so that it is comfortable to keep a fire.I do not know of any thing to write about that will interest you so I will close hoping that I will hear from you soon.I remain yours withLoveB.H. Wilson. Benton H. Wilson to Walt Whitman, 15 September 1867"
