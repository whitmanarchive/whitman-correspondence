    "text": "431 Stevens st.Street / cor West. / Camden, / N.New Jersey. Sunday, noon.Dear Nelly,I must first tell you what will please you best, namely that I [am] feeling decidedly better than usual this morning—I have spent an hour in the bath room, (quite my regular test,) & come out not only without any diminution of strength or elasticity—but an increase—& with a visit or descending upon me like of a long-absent feeling of physical ease & unconsciousness, which I will welcome as a precursor, even if [it] soon passes over (as it doubtless will)—but hope for return. For I suppose you know that my condition is very tantalizing in its fluctuations—Like today as I write—now the sun is out bright enough—& fifteen minutes since, I noticed from the window quite a flurry of snow—& cloudy—At any rate I am feeling again to-day one of the glimpses I had or was beginning to have last May, before mother died—am under its influence & benefit to-day—& you shall have the good of it, Nelly dear—as far as this note can give. Poor, poor, Ada Clare—I have been inexpressibly shocked by the horrible & sudden close of her gay, easy, sunny free, loose, but not ungood life—I suppose you have seen about it, but I cut the enclosed from the Herald in case you have not—Nelly, I rec'dreceived your letter—I send W. Graphics of 21st & 28th as you request—The W. G. of 7th March is my last no.—did you get it?—I rec'dreceived Charley's letter—Love to you & all—I feel to-day as though we shall yet be together again & have better times than ever, Nelly dear. Walt Walt Whitman to Ellen M. O'Connor, [8 March 1874]"
