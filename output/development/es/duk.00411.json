But Han is much concerned about yourself—your confinement disabilities—she is extremely nervous, being weak from her prostrating sickness. Is striving hard however to do for herself—about the kitchen—has her own bedroom—large—airy, just as she needs or desired. We put up another stove last Saturday (heater) which I traded for—a heater—which fortunately came just in this nick of time—for a great change in the weather—cold.In reply to your question I would state that the address of our good physician and friend is Doctor L.
