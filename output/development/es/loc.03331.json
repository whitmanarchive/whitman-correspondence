    "text": "WALTER SCOTT,PUBLISHERTHE CAMELOT SERIES. EDITED BY ERNEST RHYS.24 WARWICK LANE, LONDON, E.C.FROM ERNEST RHYS. C/O Walter Scott24 Warwick Lane.TOWalt Whitman.Camden3rd Jany. 1888 Your card of 24th Dec. came two days ago, not a little to my relief. I was beginning to fear lest you were not so well again. This year ought to treat you well, & give you the wind & weather & everything that you love, seeing that in it you attain three score & ten. If good wishes of friends were of any direct use, physically, I mean, as well as in other ways, it would be the happiest year of your life. It seems very right & fit that in it you should publish the Édition Définitive in this vol. of your \"Complete Works,\" which we all so eagerly expect. The last few weeks have brought nothing perhaps that is very remarkable on the surface here. I have been jogging along quietly enough, but absorbing always a great deal humanly from the endlessly wonderful life of this great London. One of the most striking episodes I have lately had any share in was the Midnight Meeting of the unemployed of London on Christmas Eve. It was held at the foot of Cleopatra's Needle, round the base of which the various speakers were grouped, faced by the motley throng of men, who cheered hoarsely with hungry throats as the speechifying went on. Through the day it had been wet & foggy in turn, but now the sky was of an American clearness, the half-moon shining bright behind the shaft of Cleopatra's Needle, contrasting strangely with the red torches held to light the orators. All together an impressive scene; & when the Christmas Bells rang out, and one of the speakers called out —\"Peace on Earth, Goodwill towards Men! If Jesus were in London to-day, would he be in those churches?\"—and the crowd shouted back, \"No! he'd be here!—here with us!\"—the effect was dramatic in the extreme. When I had been standing in the crowd for some time, I discovered Jo. Pennell, the artist, standing near me and we presently went home together. He lives in the next street to Cowley St. from which by the way I may have to move shortly as my sister Edith (whom you know) is coming up to town to study music at the Academy. I am writing this at the Reading Room of British Museum, & must end it rather hurriedly having to run off to meet my brother Percy (who is an actor) at Euston Station. Don't let me forget to tell you that that [sic] last night I saw Edward Carpenter—first time these three years—at a meeting of Fabian Socy., where he lectures. He looks older than he did, —more nervous lines in his face. As he is staying in town we shall probably meet again. For the present then, So Long!Ernest RhysSmith Art Review wants me to write an article on \"The Portrait of W. Whitman\" with portrait reproductions. Can you send any new pictures of yourself?see notes July 11 1888 Ernest Rhys to Walt Whitman, 3 January 1888"
