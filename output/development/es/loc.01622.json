I rec'd your last. I suppose you got mine last Tuesday——I have just had my dinner, bean soup, boiled beef, & pumpkin-pie, all good—so you see I might be doing worse—it is now just after 2, & I am feeling quite comfortable—& hope this will find you all right, my loving boy—Walt. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 14 November [1873]"
