I went down to the depot to meet you, and not finding you, I thought perhaps you came on the 1 O'Clock train, so I went down to the house but did not find you. I have been over in the City to daytoday, but did not get any thinganything to do, I went around untill[until] I got sick and then I came over here. I have been to see several over here but none could give me any encouragement. You may say that I don't care for you, but I do. I think of you all the time. I want you to come up to-morrowtomorrow night if you can. I have been to bed to nighttonight, but could not sleep forefor thinking of you so I got up and scribbled a few lines to you, to go in the morning mail. I hope you will not disappoint me. I want you to look over the past and I will do my best to wardtoward you in the future. You are all the true friend I have, and when I cannot have you I will go away some ware[somewhere], I don't know where. Mr Carpenter has been to see me several times since I was away and he lef[left] me a book and a letter, the letter was to inform me of his intention of going back to England, I will show it to you when I see you. good bye.Believe me to be your true and loving friend,Harry StaffordI shall be at the station to meet you.yoursH S Harry Stafford to Walt Whitman, 21 May 1877"
