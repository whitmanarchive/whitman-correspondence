In any edition, first or last, I believe they are to have lasting remembrance. They are the American poetry which the Old World has been challenging us so long to produce; they \"stir the blood like the sound of a trumpet.\" Faithfully yours,Titus M. Coan. Titus M. Coan to Walt Whitman, 22 November 1880"
