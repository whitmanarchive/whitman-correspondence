Gosse on Tennyson's \"Throstle\"—I have not seen Ed. Wilkins yet, nor (of course) got the photo's—he is to be here this afternoon or evening I believe. Nothing new from Willy Gurd. I expect to go to Guelph (Ont.) tomorrow to give evidence on a murder trial (whether the homicide is sane or not). I lectured to students 2½ hours yesterday afternoon. We are all well—The poor P. of Wales seems from the reports to be very ill—looks as if he would never ascend the throneR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 29 October 1889"
