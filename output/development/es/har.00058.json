    "text": "431 Stevens st. cor West, Camden, N. J.Sunday afternoon Dec. 7Dear John Burroughs,I am still here, & still very much the same as when I last wrote you—have not retrograded any, nor had any more of the very bad spells like those in the early part of October—bodily strength is certainly better—dont[don't] so easily tire, & give out—locomotion still very bad—& head not out of the woods yet—but spirits & feelings pretty good—I have sent you the Graphic, with piece by me, about the Capitol, which I suppose you rec'd—also same paper with my portrait & criticism by \"Matador\"—I have rec'd a letter lately from Eldridge—nothing new at Washington, in my affairs—Mrs. O'Connor was to return last Tuesday—I have written a couple of new poems, which I have sold to a magazine & got the money for—I think one will appear in January number—I will leave you to guess the magazine—How are you getting along? How is 'Sula?—Love to both of you—I am writing this up in my room—it is growing dark—I am going out to tea, to an acquaintance here—Walt Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 7 December 1873"
