    "text": "Brooklyn, N. Y.March 26, 1872. My dear Mr. Forman,Your letter & the fine poem of \"the Great Peace-Maker\" have been rec'dreceived by me, & read with pleasure. With regard to re-printing my book in full in England I can only say that of course it would be gratifying to me—But I should like to be informed in advance of any thing pending that way, as I should like to make one or two suggestions before the book is begun. A preface or introduction mainly of statistical nature (about the book & myself) including a brief syllabus of the plan & idea of \"Leaves of Grass\" from its own point of view—would be judicious—but I don't think favorably of a literary criticism for preface—I have an Edition (the sixth) just out—edition 1872—in some respects probably the best—Sampson Low, and Trübner have copies of it.—It looks just now as though some form of international copyright might be legalized here—If so, this might be worth considering in reference to the reprint of my book in England.If you can get a look at the Danish (Copenhagen) Monthly Magazine \"For Ide og Virkeliged,\" \"For Idea & Reality,\" either of Feb.February or March, I am not certain which, I understand it has a criticism on my book, from a believer. I am here on a visit, & return to Washington in a few days. I shall always be happy to hear from you. My address is Solicitor's Office, Treasury, Washington, D. C.—U.S.A.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to H. Buxton Forman, 26 March 1872"
