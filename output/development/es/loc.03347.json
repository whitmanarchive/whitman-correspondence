    "text": "Washington, D.C.August 31, 1888My dear Walt:I got your letter of the 6th, a postal card of the 11th, divers newspapers, and day before yesterday the handsome magazine with the pen-an-ink portrait—a beautiful piece of work, but a bad likeness—in fact, a caricature, which I hope, as Voltaire said of the \"Letter to Posterity,\" is a letter that will never reach its address. He has given you a wad for a mouth and made you squint like one of George Borrow's gipsies. Drat his imperence!I have had it on my mind for a month to write, but have had a bad time. I thought of you anxiously during the abominable swelter of August, and felt rejoiced when the cool spell came, hoping it would do you good, though I got a cold out of it, by ill luck, which pulled me back considerably.Your letter was very comforting. I shall hope to hear good news of you. I sent your messages to Dr. Channing, Grace and Stedman. No news has reached me about the calendar, but I hope it is all right. Grace is expected here in a few days.Who is it writes of you so friendlily in the editorial notes of Lippincott?I shall hope all good things for November Boughs. I wish it were further along.I have been using the spare hours when I have felt less weak and woe-begone than I usually do, and less weighted down with office work, to scratch off in pencil a defence of Donnelly's book for the N. A. Review, if I can only get it in. It has been a bad task, but a duty, for the reviewers have been outrageous.My hope and heart are high for you. If the weather will only let up!Good bye. I find that I can't write much, as I hoped to when I began. As the Indian said to Roger Williams when they landed at Seekonk, \"What cheer, brother, what cheer!\"—meaning, all cheer!Affectionately,W.D.O'CWalt Whitman.See notes Sept 1 1888 William D. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 31 August 1888"
