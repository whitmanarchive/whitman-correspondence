    "text": "Horace C Simmons12 Princess Road,South Norwood,London, S.E.January, 1889.'Stranger, if passing, you meet me...'Dear Sir,With this note I send you a little Berkshire almanack which if you look into it at all will give you some idea of the extent and variety of business which the energetic and enterprising lady at whose request I write is successfully conducting at ReadingReading. This business established by my old and valued friend Mr. George Lovejoy—whose right hand Miss Langley became in business matters of late years was purchased at his death by her and has since been even further developed. Few people in Berkshire are unacquainted with the name of 'Lovejoy' as many are reminded by it of obligations incurred and help or advice received from him to whom it belonged.But what is all this to you?—Well, merely merely a little preamble to prepare your mind for a request Miss Langley desired me, when at Reading—(my native town—) for the New Year's day last week, to make to you that you might send her a complete list of all books &c published by you, that she may obtain the same and add them to her General Circulating Library.I don't quite know why she did not write herself but she is a busy woman and she knows that I am am glad to promote your fame and to help, as far as I may, both her and you and, besides, she remembers, what I daresay you have long forgotten, that I had the honour of seeing you 'at home' in Mickle St in 1886 (august) and was very kindly received by the poet of democracy whose courtesy and truth encourages me to hope that this note will find favour or forgiveness with him:—and Miss Langley a reply!Do not trouble to write toYours Very TrulyHorace C. Simmons Horace C. Simmons to Walt Whitman, January 1889"
