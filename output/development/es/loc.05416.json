    "text": "sister LouCamden.Sunday 5 P. M.Dear Brother Walt.I expect you will be a little surprised to hear from me, when mother writes to you so often, but she has seemed so very anxious to see you lately and weariesworries so much about you, that I thought I would urge the matter some I hope that you will come as soon as you feel you are able I have been kind of miserable this spring, but am feeling pretty well again, and we have no trouble housekeeping, as an Aunt of mine, came to pay me a visit a week before I was sick, and when I was taken sick, she very kindly stayed with us, and has taken all the care off my shoulders, so you will not be any trouble at all, come when you will. If you could only have been with us during your sickness I should have been glad.Mattie's sickness and death, and your trouble, has wearied mother a great deal this winter, and now she seems to be suffering from a nervous prostration. The doctor says it is not the dyspepsia, that her nerves are all out of order, she lays down sometimes during the day, but not often, and she is very tremulous, and discouraged about herself. Yesterday she seemed better, but to daytoday is quite miserable. How we all wish you were here, we think it would do her goodGeorge and Eddie are both well. It has been cloudy all day, with light rains, and in fact has rained for three days, the weather is enough to make one gloomy. Walt if you please dont[don't] mention to mother when you write that you received this.George wanted me to urge your coming as soon as you couldWith much love from allYoursLou Louisa Orr Whitman to Walt Whitman, [12 May 1873]"
