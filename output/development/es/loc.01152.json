    "text": "West Park, N.Y.Oct. 7. 85Dear Walt: We left Ocean Grove the next day after I was with you, & are now all home again, safe & snug. I gave up the Ky.Kentucky trip for the present, Gilder said next spring would do, so I expect to go next May, & see the season open down there. I hope you are still mending, Walt. I am almost certain you eat too heartily & make too much blood & fat; at least that you eat too hearty food. As I told you, I was profoundly impressed by a couple of articles in the \"Fortnightly Review\" by Sir Wm Thompson, on \"Diet with relation to Age & Activity\" He shows very convincingly that as our activities fail by the advance of age, we must cut down on our food. If not the engine makes too much steam, things become cloged[clogged] & congested & the whole economy of the system deranged. He says a little meat once a day is enough, & recommends the cereals & fruits. I think you make too much blood. This congested condition of your organs at times, shows it. Then you looked to me too fat; & fat at your age clogs, & hinders the circulation. I shall talk to my DrDoctor about you when I see him again, but if I were you I would adopt such a diet as would make my blood as thin as possible, & so lessen the arterial strain This is common sense, & I believe good science. In the best health, we grow lean. Sir Wm Thompson, says like a man training for the ring. I gained much flesh this summer, & am dull & spiritless this fall. As a consequence, I must work it off some way. Drop me a card if you can how you are.With much love,John Burroughssee notes June 30 & July 1 1888a good letter â˜ž read again John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 7 October 1885"
