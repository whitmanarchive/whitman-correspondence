    "text": "Dear Brother,As you have given me permission I have taken the liberty to address you as above, and I assure you I fully reciprocate your friendship as expressed in your letter and it will afford me great pleasure to meet you after the war will have terminated or sooner if circumstances will permit.I am much pleased that Lewy is so cheerful and happy, and I trust he will be successful in his hopes and desires and be prosperous and happy and enjoy life to a good old age. I am sorry very sorry that Hiram has not improved. I was in hopes that ere this he would be sufficiently recovered to go Home and I sincerly[sincerely] hope that it will not be long until he can do so. It is [my] sincere wish that Johny Makey will survive the operation and ultimately recover. I hope you will be more fortunate and procure a good berth, and be ever prosperous. We in the Army feel our reserves at Charleston and Vicksburg very deeply as yet we have not had a chance to strike a blow in our vicinity but as you say that time is near at hand and I hope we will be successful at any rate we will do out utmost and endeavor to give the Rebels the biggest thrashing they have yet received. Let the Government Officials in Washington mind their own biz. let Hooker alone and the Army of the Potomac will be triuimphant[triumphant] but as long as they will continue to interfere with our Gen[era]ls arrangements, dictate to him when he shall move, and when he shall halt, just so long will the Army of the Potomac be of little avail. It is composed of good material, and all ready for a forward movement. then let Hooker have the reins, and he will soon drive the Rebs to Richmond and far beyond it.Yes my dear Brother, You have my friendship as fully as you can desire, and I hope we will meet again.Having nothing more of importance to communicate, I will conclude with my best wishes for your health and happiness and believe me to beYours sincerly[sincerely],Thos P. Sawyer Thomas P. Sawyer to Walt Whitman, 26 April 1863"
