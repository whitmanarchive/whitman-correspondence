    "text": "315 E 14th St New York April 8th 1887.Dear Mr. WhitmanI intended writing to you to wish you good bye, but have just heard there is a chance of my seeing you next week at Madison Square Theatre, so of course, I shall be there. Will there be any chance of my getting to speak to you? If there are to be any people on the platform by you, & you could get me a place, I should feel the honour greatly. I sincerely hope your jaunt to the theatre with us, & by breaking the monotony, did you good. Ernest Rhys has written to me for a little news about you & to ask me to see him in town to report all I know. How beautiful the New York harbour is! I greatly enjoy seeing the in-coming & out-going ships bathed in the clear spring sunlight. I have much to thank you forâ€”your works give me hope & joy, while the time spent with you was the most gratifying spent in this country. I intend to write to you from England, & at all times, if I can do anything for you, it will most willingly be done. Praying to God that He will send his blessings upon you, like rain upon a grand old oak. I remain proud to call myself your admiring friend Geo Herbert Kersley George H. Kersley to Walt Whitman, 8 April 1887"
