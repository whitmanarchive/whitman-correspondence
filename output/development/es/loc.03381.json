    "text": "Supreme Court Library Melbourne 24 / 11 / 90 My Dear Master and (may I say?) Comrade I received your letter of the 23rd with enclosing \"Osceola\" \"A Twilight Song\" and \"To the Sunset Breeze,\" and also a copy of a September Philadelphia Press with a poem on you, all right, and feel that I cannot express my thanks (on behalf of us all) sufficiently to you for your noble kindness to us. I fear I detected a tone of weariness and affliction between the lines and can only say we are sorry from our hearts that your winter days should be so. I am sorry that your Touchstone (Mr. Bury) had to return from England before crossing to you. He was detained long over the strike & business connected with it. I wrote to him & told him of all your expressions of good will and greetings of love to him & us all. I enclose his letter to me. There is much misery & pinching among us in Australia over the strike. The men lost, as was inevitable, this time, but I do not think it is really a loss after all. Fred & Jim and Ada & Ted & mr & mrs Fryer & my wife all send their love to you, bound with every good wish for you. We are anxiously waiting to hear the result of Ingersoll's goodness. (I believe they have a secret good word for you, for this reason. I used to bother them a lot with a series of serrated word-groups that I called poetry, but since your influence came, they have been shared, & I have no doubt, are thankful accordingly.) I thank you again for \"To the Sunset Breeze.\" Somehow I feel your spirit at its best through that: it is a kind of commentary (among other things) on the unexplainable (to me) feeling of friendship with, at times, the hot wind on the central plains, at others, the gale from the ice-teeth of the Southern Pole. Your breeze isn't like them but you know the language of which they are a (perhaps harsh) dialect. I thank you too for the precious gift of a poem signed by yourself with your own name. I am finished now. With warmest Love, my dear, dear Master, I remainBernard O'Dowd P.S. Will you please send me for Jim Hartigan, Fred Woods & myself three (3) \"Complete Poems & Prose\" to same address as this (Â£ 5 enclosed) Books (four complete works) sent by Express Dec 27 '90. Rec'd safely by B O'D Bernard O'Dowd to Walt Whitman, 24 November 1890"
