    "text": "New York, September 27, 1868. My dear Dr. Channing:I yesterday received your kind note. I gladly accept your invitation & hospitality. My leave of absence continues for some time yet, & I should probably like to visit you for a few days, just subsequently to the middle of October—But I will write you a day or two before I come. I send my best respects & love to Mrs. Channing. As I write we are having a rainy, dark sulky Sunday—after a rainy night. I am well & quietly enjoying holiday. I wish you & wife to read my last piece in The Broadway London Magazine for October. You can get it at any good bookstand. Walt Whitman. Walt Whitman to William F. Channing, 27 September 1868"
