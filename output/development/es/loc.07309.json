    "text": "London, Ont.,9 June 1889I have your letter of 4th & 5th and post card of 6th You will know before this that I got the papers (with account of banquet) but if you send another set (not to hand yet) it is no harm. Yes,of course I have the pocket book L. of G. and am never tired of handling it and admiring it—it is the lovelist little book I ever saw and now that the last corrections are made it is I suppose abt perfect as a piece of printing. I like the paper much, it has a good dead surface and tho' the ink shows through a little it does not obscure the reading any to hurt. Please do not forget to send me a copy (no doubt you have some printed as usual, a better yet if it would not be too much trouble to write of out for me—I should value an M.S. copy to no end) of \"Voice from Death\" What a fearful catastrophe! America has never seen the like and I trust never will again—What a subject for an interlude in a big, greatpoem—or for a chapter in some great prose work! But it seems a sin to think of it that way—it is too awful—the hundreds of little children and women overwhelmed and suffocated in a moment. The great ship wrecks sink into insignificance before the honor of it. I have written Harned to put me down for $5. worth of the banquet book or pamphlet—guess it will be quite an interesting contribution to the great heap of W.W. literature. Nothing new from W.J. Gurd and the meter—I guess all is going well but it goes mighty slow. All well here. Rain, rain, rain—has rained now for near a month and still keeps on—raining quite hard the present moment (11.40 a.m.).Au revoir, dear Walt,Love to you alwaysR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 9 June 1889"
