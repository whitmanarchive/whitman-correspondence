ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,24 Aug 1888I have not written you for some days, do not know how many, press of work still continues and I have not had any thing to say that seemed worth while and in fact have not now. Mrs Bucke is home again from Sarnia, I was there over Sunday and Pardee is not much better. Willy Gurd (the inventor of the meter) came home two days ago—it remains to be proven whether the meter will be a financial success. I suppose you are getting the \"Complete Works\" into shape—in your mind, that is?—Will you not keep the sale of this big book in your own hands? Make it autograph & personal? Have you fixed on the price? I do not think it should be less than $10. I should not look for a large sale but that those who really care for you and your writings should have something substantial and handsome as a perpetual reminder of you, something that they would hand down to their children \"bequeathing it as a rich legacy\"—Write me a line when you feel to—I do not suppose you care to exert yourself much and I would not have you worry yourself to write me when you do not feel up to it.I am, my dear friend,Affectionately yoursRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 24 August 1888"
