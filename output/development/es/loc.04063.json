    "text": "Clifton Hill House,Clifton, BristolJuly 12, 1877Dear Mr. WhitmanI was away from England when your volumes reached me, & since my return (during the last six weeks) I have been very ill with an attack of hemorrhage from the lung—brought on while riding a pulling horse at a time when I was weak from cold. This must account for my delay in writing to thank you for them & to express the great pleasure which your inscription in two of the volumes has given me.I intend to put into my envelope a letter to you with some verses from one of your great admirers in England. It is my nephew— the second son of my sister who married Sir Edward Strachey, a Somersetshire baronet. I gave him a copy of Leaves of Grass in 1874, & he knows a great portion of it now by heart. Though still so young, he has developed a considerable faculty for writing & is an enthusiastic student of literature as well as a frank vigorous lively young fellow. I thought you might like to see how some of the youth of England is being drawn toward you.Believe me always sincerely & affectionately yoursJ. A. Symonds.St. Loe writes so bad a hand that I shall transcribe his verses for himIThine is no Carol of weak love or hate;Thine is no Song by listless idler Sung;No poor attempt to cheat us from our fate;No shallow words from shallower fancies wrung.These are not thine; thy music pure is flungFrom out a heart that throbs & pants, which achesWith its great love: our Suffering role amongThou com'st with thy great gift of song that makesAll things seem bright & clear,all lovelier vision wakes.IIThough now the world is deaf & will not hear,Though now the foolish rail & sneer at theeIt matters not: their frowns thou dost not fearThou know'st the day will come the When thou in love with Him of GalileeShalt have thy place. Not yet, The years must wane,And thought from Superstition's curse be free:When this is ended, thou with him shalt reignStrong in all hearts, as loved, asmighty brothers twain.St. Loe Strachey John Addington Symonds to Walt Whitman, 12 July 1877"
