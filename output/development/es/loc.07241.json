    "text": "Superintendent's Office. ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,14 Sept 1888I have been away two days—went Wednesday—wedding yesterday back today. Did some meter business at same time. The wedding was a very pleasant one, both groom & bride very jolly—everything went smoothly and we all had a good time—. The affair was very stilishstylish—6 bridesmaids &c &c ChampaineChampagne breakfast. And all the rest of it—wedding presents very handsome and very numerous—Got back home at noon today and all afternoon we have been having \"athletic sports\" at the asylum.—quite a \"big time\" attendants and patients taking part—we had over $100. worth of prizes and had a lot of fun. I suppose the books are getting on? I hope you will settle down to the notion of issuing the big book yourself without the intermediary of any publisher—print 400 or 500 copies—get them up in all ways in first class style—number each—sell for $10. Advertise in the \"N.B.\" and perhaps in \"Critic\" & \"Pall Mall Gazette\"— let Horace do all the work except autographing—make it a solid remembrance of yourself for your friends—make it as personal as possibleLove to youRMBuckeSee notes Sept 17, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 14 September 1888"
