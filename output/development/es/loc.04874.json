Should you print it, I leave the head-lines & introductory to you—& dont forget to give Rice's book the due credit. Should you print, I wish you would send me here 25 copies paper.—I am ab't as usual—just going to drive down 12 miles to visit a poor young fellow, Walter Borton, very low with consumption.Love to Mrs. W. and the sister.Walt WhitmanIf you cant use it, return the enclosed proof to me.
