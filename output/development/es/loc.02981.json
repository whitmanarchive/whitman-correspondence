    "text": "Care Chas. E. Legg,146 Devonshire St.Boston, Mass.Sept. 26. 1889.Dear Walt,I sent thanks by Mr. Traubel in my letter to him for the photograph of William, & also for the pictures of the \"laughing Philosopher,\" & the note enclosed. I have a photog. like it & will send it, with another, the Rossiter Johnson & let him select. I return yours. Send me a postal card that I may know if you get it safely. I have been ill since I came here (to Nantucket) but am better now. I am with a widow lady friend for a short time, but soon expect to be near Boston, & so please send to the address at the head of this letter. Glad that you had such a pleasant visit with Sir Edwin Arnold. You know he married the daughter of our dear friend William Henry Channing, who used to be in Washington during the war.I did receive Liberty with Horace Traubel's article & wrote him at once thanking him for it. It is noble and generous & touched me most deeply. I have written to Tucker asking him to save six copies for me till I go to Boston, & can call or send for them. I hope Mr. Traubel got my letter.How goes it with you?Send a line.With love alwaysâ€”Nelly O'Connor.I send photog. by this mail. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 26 September 1889"
