    "text": "Hardwicke CottageWimbledon Common,London, S. W.Sep 10 /67.My dear friend,It gave me much pleasure to hear from you; and now I am quite full of gratitude for the photograph—a grand one—the present of all others desirable by me. The copy suitable for an edition here should we be able to reach to that I have and shall keep carefully. When it is achieved it will probably be the result and fruit of more reviewing and discussion. I shall keep my eyes wide open; and the volume with O'C's introduction shall come out just as it is. I am not sure but that it will in the end have to be done at our own expense,—which I believe would be repaid. It is the kind of book that if it can once get out here will sell. The English groan for something better than the perpetual réchauffé of their literature. I have not been in London for some little time and have not yet had time to consult others about the matter. I shall be able to write you more satisfactorily a little later. I hear that you have written something in the Galaxy. Pray tell O'Connor I shall look to him to send me such things: I can't take all American magazines; but if you intend to write for the Galaxy regularly I shall take that.With much friendship for you and O'Connor and his wife,I am yours,M.D. Conway Moncure D. Conway to Walt Whitman, 10 September 1867"
