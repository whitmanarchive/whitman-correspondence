    "text": "To Mr Alcott,April 26 '68Your kind & welcome letter came to hand. Pardon me for not responding sooner. I esteem your friendly appreciation of \"Democracy.\" I have just sent you \"Personalism\"—which is to be followed, in perhaps a couple of months or so, by another article, addressing itself mainly to the question of what kind of Literature we must seek, for our coming America, &c. In the three articles (to be gathered probably in book) I put forth, to germinate if they may, what I would fain hope might prove little seeds & roots. I am still living here in Washington—employed in a post in the Attorney General's office, very pleasantly, with sufficient leisure, & almost entirely without those peculiar belongings, that make the Treasury & Interior Dep't &c. clerkships disagreeable. I am, as ever, working on Leaves of Grass—hoping to bring it yet into fitter & fuller proportions. I am well as usual. My dear mother is living & well; we speak of you. I wish you to give my best respects & love to Mr. Emerson— Walt Whitman to A. Bronson Alcott, 26 April 1868"
