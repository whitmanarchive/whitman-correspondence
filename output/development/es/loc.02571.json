BROOME ST.New York, Sept 10 1887Dear Walt;The inclosed explains itself, Either a forgery as well as theft has been committed or else you have had happen to you what has happened to me and I'm only 50 yrsyears oldâ€” Viz: I have rec'dreceived a draft, endorsed it, deposited it, and forgot to give my customer credit for it. It happens, and will happen a thousand times. An interruption, a call of a friend, or a dozen other things will make me do what they will never believe they have done until forced to. Maybe this Postal Card will be a reminder to you.I am coming over to your celebration next week and will help you straighten out the matter.I have written to Mr Shields and asked him to send me the draft.Alma and the boys return today.With LoveSincerely yrsJH Johnston John H. Johnston to Walt Whitman, 10 September 1887"
