    "text": "Millthorpein Chesterfield27 Dec 88Dear Walt—So glad to hear from you once more—and that you keep going, not withstanding all the buffets of time & fortune. Very wearisome sometimes I fear, these long spells of illness: so complicated, never-ended. Just now I am giving every day to see an old friend, 72 yrs.years of age—who is very badly down with heart disease—an old harpist—plays at country fairs, &c, a reader & admirer of your Leaves of G.Grass, communist, and dreamer of social ideals—he keeps saying \"this disease of mine has no end, no sides, and no middle\" I fear you must feel like that! Dear Walt—how strange it is that we are bound so & entangled in this thing we call the body, without being able to get at the connections. I got yr.your November Boughs too for which many thanks. I like the book ever so much, both outside & in. Have just written a review of it for the Scottish Art Review—wh.which I will send you when it comes out. I like the color & shape of the book—good strong sewing too. Title is a good one. Old Salt Kossabone is fine, & Red Jacket, and many others. Yonnondio I like very much. The whole book is full of yourself Walt, and the great invisible wind sweeping thro'through the boughs—has a quality of its own too I sh'should say, wh.which is a worthy addition to LLeaves of GGrass & Specimen Days.Glad to hear Herbert G. is doing well. Enclosed draft is only a duplicate of one we sent you in May—wh.which probably you got all right—but not having heard I thought I wd.would send you this instead of destroying it. You can destroy it.Everything going well with me just now—I have George Hukin & his wife up here for Christmas—friends I mentioned to you a year or more ago. He & I are still close friends. The Rain is beating upon the windows—& he is reading Bucke's book about you.With love to you as everEdwd Carpenter Edward Carpenter to Walt Whitman, 27 December 1888"
