    "text": "431 Stevens StreetCamden New JerseyJuly 17 '81Dear SirsI have been unwell & disabled the last fifteen days from the heat & several little things happening. Am pretty well shattered anyhow—Am busy with the copy of the book—thought I had finished—but I find it will bear about as much work as I can put on it—& I can't hurry—But it is about in printing office shape—How will it do to have this definite arrangement—that I come on by (or just before) 1st of September to Boston—& we make a clear start with it at once then?—Ought to be put through I suppose in two months—say by the end of October—I was thinking something might be done with an extra bound edition for the holiday book trade for '81–2 for gift books—Couldn't we get it out early half of November if I am in Boston with the copy complete on or before 1st September sure?Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to James R. Osgood & Company, 17 July 1881"
