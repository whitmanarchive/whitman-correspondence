I have heard from him once or twice. I am expecting Ernest Rhys here soon. Morse the sculptor is still here. Mr Eakins the portrait painter, of Phila:, is going to have a whack at me next week.Dull dark dripping day as I write. My little canary is singing blithely. I enclose you my last pieces—Yes, indeed we shall be glad to see you—Mrs D will & I will—Meanwhile love to you & God bless you—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Leonard M. Brown, 19 November 1887"
