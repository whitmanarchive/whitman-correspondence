    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,17 Sept 1888Your letter of 10th with enclosures came during my absence in Sarnia and was stupidly mislaid. I came across it by accident today. I am rejoiced to hear that the German L. of G. is at last seeing the light—I shall look out for an early copy of it. As soon as you know the publisher's name & city tell me then I can tell my English bookseller to look out for it for me. Am glad to hear that \"N.B.\" will be \"entirely untrimmed\" I have sort of horror of \"trimmed\" books. Well enough for dictionaries, text books, &c. but literature should have uncut edges. I had a letter from Ingram today dated 14th he says \"I was up in W.W.s room last week—I could see no change in him, he looked bright & cheerful and in good spirits\" This reads mighty well and I am glad enough to get such news—nevertheless I do not doubt you often feel bad enough and I know you are very sick, worse luck. Still it is grand to see you keep up as you do—never giving up to the last—I think it is immense, something for us all to be proud of and to take to heart—and the world will take all this to heart one day—and will be the better for it. The meter is still creeping on—slow and sure—no hitch of any kind yet and all looking well. We have had another charming day here—perfect autumn weather. I have been all afternoon in court giving evidence in an insanity caseAlways your friendRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 17 September 1888"
