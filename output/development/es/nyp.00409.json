    "text": "Camden Jan: 2 '81Dear HankI hear from you indirectly once in a while by Hoag, (& saw Debbie & Jo some days since)—I suppose you got the postal I sent you about 12 days ago—the weather has been so bad, or I should have come down—I have had quite a good deal to do writing—have finished quite a piece for a big magazine in N. Y.—the North American Review—it was ordered—I get $100 for it—I read the proof last night & sent it off—then I have a little poem the Patrol at Barnegat probably in next Harper's—(but I think I told you about it)—then to-day I am busy on another order—So you see I have something to do—I will send you the Review piece when printed—I am feeling better and sassier this winter so far than for some years, am very comfortable here, plain & quiet though—eat my allowance every time—& have a little jug of good Jamaica rum from which I take a sip now & then—(but not very often)—came in chill'd & dumpy late yesterday afternoon—made myself a good mug of hot rum, & felt better—Hank, I hope you are having fair times on the road—I am glad you stick to it—perseverance will conquer. Horner was here again a few evenings ago, an hour—How do you get on with Col: Ingersoll's book? (You mustn't take too much stock in him)—If there is any book particular you want, you tell me, & I will try to get it—Lots of sleighs out, good sleighing—my brother was out day before yesterday, & got overturned—I wanted to go yesterday, but he was afraid for me to venture it—his nag is pretty lively, (but I should have liked that all the better)—1½—just had dinner, hot soup, cold roast beef, apple pie—all good—the sun is out real warm, & I shall go at my piece for the N Y order—it is for a lady, a friend of mine—she has been for years principal literary editor of the Herald, & now she is going to start a paper of her own—pays me—Is Ed home? I should just like to have a ten mile ride behind his nag with the sleigh bells—Dear boy, I send you my best love & dont you forget it—Your old Walt Walt Whitman to Harry Stafford, 2 January 1881"
