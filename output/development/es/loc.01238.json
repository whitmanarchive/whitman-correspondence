    "text": "MillthorpeW Chesterfield9 June 85Dear WaltBessie Ford & Isabella Ford & I have been wanting to make you a little present so we send enclosed draft for £50—hoping you will take it as an expression of our best wishes & love, and make what use of it you think proper. Please send a line either to them or me in receipt.Isabella F. was here a couple of weeks ago, and one of my sisters at the same time. I have not seen the Gilchrists since JanyJanuary.—but heard from Mrs G the day before y'dayyesterday—sorry about your ancle[ankle] I expect it will prevent you getting about so much—I am going on here, & like the place & work—tho' I guess I shall find it too quiet for a permanence. I must have more town life—We get grand crops—but the markets are awfully flat, nothing doing. I have been interested in Hinton's \"Law Breaker\" lately, have you seen it?Thanks for slips &c sent—The Springfield Republican last—I hope to write again before long—but am lazy now. Goodbye, dear friend,—we often think & talk about you over here. Take care of yourself—and accept what we send in the same spirit as it is sent—for any use.Chips Edward Carpenter to Walt Whitman, 9 July 1885"
