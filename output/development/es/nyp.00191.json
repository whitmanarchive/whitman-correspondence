    "text": "BrooklynSunday afternoon July 24 1864 My dear friendSince I last wrote to you my illness has been gradually alleviated, until now I go about pretty much the same as usual—I keep pretty old-fashioned hours, rise early, dine at 1, & go to bed before 10—My head feels clear & comfortable, & my strength has returned almost, but not quite up to what it was. I rec'd Nelly's letter, I could not get over to New York that afternoon—Nelly, my dear friend, you must excuse me—I wished much to see you, too—I hope you are having a good time & feeling well physically & in good spirits—& the little one, little Jenny, this line is for you, my dear. I hope you too are well—William, I rec'd the volume of Navy Reports, transactions of iron clads, fights, &c. for '62 & '3—it will probably give me material for some pieces, thumb-nail sketches, for my \"Drum Taps\"—I take it you had that in view in sending it to me—I am trying to make arrangements to publish my volume—I shall probably try to bring [it] out myself, stereotype it, & print an edition of 500—I could sell that number by my own exertions in Brooklyn & New York in three weeks.I rec'd Charles Eldridge's last letter—so he is to go down to front again —how I wish I was in Washington to go with him & Major—I should try it as I am, & be glad of the chance—O I almost forgot the big raid—it is already a thing of the past, I find by my own thoughts & memory, but I suppose it would not do to write a letter to Washington so soon & not mention it—We have heard from my brother George up to the 18th inst.—he was living & well up to that time—At home here all well as usual—Mother's age I think begins to just show—in a few weeks, she will commence her 70th year—still she does most of her light housework—My sister & her children are well—(Nelly, I write these particulars for you)—Well, William, about the war I have to inform you that I remain hopeful & confident yet—I still think Grant will go into Richmond—My brother describes the spirit of the troops as confident & sanguine under all their trials—I wish you to enclose this in your next letter to Nelly—I wish you to give my remembrance & love to the Howells, to Miss Howard & to Arnold Johnson—Write soon & tell me all the news—tell me how is Ashton—Good bye & God bless you, my dear friend—Walt Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 24 July 1864"
