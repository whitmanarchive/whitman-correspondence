    "text": "Burlington VermontApril 19 1887Dear Walt.Han has recdreceived all of your postals and copy of Camden Paper and Tribune; over report of your grand success at Madison Theatre she fairly revels in exultation. She is strong enough to go out now, visiting. I have had a pretty fair success past winter at low prices, but just now there is a halt. The lake is frozen over yet, and the country roads so impeded that it interrupts all business. A new Hotel is opening here, and the proprietor encourages me much, but I must wait. I have not gone behind hand, yet our coal is exhausted, and am in need of colors: I have several large and small pictures on hand which I hope to sell toward June & July. I would like to go to California on trial, yet misgivings intrude at this point, there has been so much disaster— Could you help me ever so little—send it to Han for my use. My sister has assisted me the same—to keep out of debt. Miller continues his very enthusiastic letters— Charlie Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 19 April 1887"
