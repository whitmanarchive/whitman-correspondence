    "text": "4 Trafalgar SquareLondon WC.Oct. 3, 1888.Dear Friend:Your card to New Haven followed me on here, where I have been for some months, looking after the production of a work on wood-engraving.The enclosed letter seems to have anticipated your request. My answer to it has crossed the letter enclosing yours. In sending that I wrote also home, telling them to look for and forward the block to Stedman. I presume it before now has gone to him. Will you write to him for what use you yourself need of it. I am glad to see your hand again & anyway to hear of you I hope you keep in fair health & in as much prosperity as may be necessary for the poet.For myself, after some five years work on a book concerning my own especial art, I am now waiting the return, which may give me a sufficiency, or may not. At 76, or close upon it, one need not be very anxious. I keep in good health.Give me a few words of yourself. The above address will find me for some months to come.Always heartily yoursWJ LintonSee notes Oct 13 1888 William J. Linton to Walt Whitman, 3 October 1888"
