    "text": "University Press,Press Revise RoomSept. 9, 88Dear W.W.The precious volume 'November Boughs' arrived last night and drew forth an exclamation of delight from me as I untied the package at the supper table. The portrait was a real surprise, & I value very highly the portrait of E. Hicks, a remarkable face. A god-smit man of the old heroic stamp.The mélange of the vol. exhibits a range & strength that I had not tho't to be quite so marked, when I read the pieces separately as they came out. The very mass is wonderful, considering that they emanate from a semi-invalid.I thank you deeply for the beautiful vol. & for its inscription, & the good nice Sunday-afternoon letter. I devoured the new poems & prose pieces bit by bit, stealhily[stealthily] to-day, having the book (disguised by cover) in my drawer, whence I took it out to read from time to time.I notice a deepening shade of the sombresomber & of pathos throughout the latest bits of poetry. But it is better so: it completes your picture of a typical man—a man complete, clear through the \"opiate\" shades to the gates of death.The plaster bust I still hold in trust. Mr. Sanborn accepted it for the Concord School. But as the School is closed for the following year, I suppose he neglects to call for it. I shall take occasion to speak of it (indirectly) some day, & follow his directions. The bust shall surely go into some gallery, or I'll be busted myself. I hope to write a notice of the 'Boughs' for the Transcript.affectionately & admiringlyyour friendW. S. KennedySorry indeed to hear of O'Connor's bad state. We all need out'o'door life continually.P.S. I am so sorry to hear so much of your bad digestion & lethargy. Don't you think you ought to take a railway sleeper for Florida this winter? William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 9 September 1888"
