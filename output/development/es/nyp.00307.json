I got two letters from Jeff to-day, the last one dated the 16th—Matt had rested well the night before— poor, poor Mat, I am ready to hear to her departure any day—it seems terrible— Things are going on as well as could be expected with me, but slowly— I overdid the matter day before yesterday, and am now waiting— I am sitting up by the stove alone writing this. Love [to] you, dearest Mother, and to all— Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, [19 February 1873]"
