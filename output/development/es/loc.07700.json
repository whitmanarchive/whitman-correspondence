    "text": "Camden1889Sept: 6—early P M—A warm rather oppressive day—these middle hours—not well—lying down a good deal—bowel action yesterday— y'rs rec'd—out to river side last evn'g by wheel chair— Sept: 7—P M—ab't same—rather bad, but nothing extreme—had a partially good night—a card from Kennedy, nothing very significant— good memoriam article in \"Liberty\" Boston Sept. 7, by Horace ab't O'Connor—I expect some copies & then I will send you one—Ed has been over to the big launch, the new war ship \"Philadelphia\" noon to-day— weather middling to-day, warmish, a little air—Horace's dinner book will be out next week—I am sitting here in big chair—alternate to bed— Sept: 8—noon—a shade easier—rather extra breakfast, a rare fried egg, Graham toast, roast apple & tea—bowel action—cloudy, still day, not warm—T B and Mr Green, English Unitarian preacher, just here—card f'm Kennedy enc'd: just rec'd—also an old letter f'm Dowden— Walt WhitmanSept 5.Dear Dad:I wish I cd give your dear hand a good grip to-day, I am now reading 1st proof at Riverside Press,—a nice berth for me. I have abt 10 minutes a day to my self! I find that that Gardner publishes highly respectable religious books (not our cosmic=pantheistic kind, of course)! I suppose Fredk. Wilson has my MS now. Am going to take a vacation in a month. Do drop me a line dear & revered papa, & relieve my anxiety abt you.W. S. Kennedy. Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 6–8 September 1889"
