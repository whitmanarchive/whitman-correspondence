    "text": "Aug. 22. My dear Ramsdell,Perhaps it may hardly be necessary, but I feel to write you a line of caution about the Tennyson letter. I rely on your promise not to publish the letter, nor any thing equivalent to it. The fact of it, with Tennyson's complimentary message & invitation, I have no objection to your printing &, after what I have said, leave it to you to carry all that out. You might do well to put in about my intended appearance before the American Institute, at its 40th opening, Sept. 7th in New York, and that the curiosity of both my friends & foes is extremely piqued, &c &c.—what the poem will be—how delivered—&c &c—W. W. Walt Whitman to Hiram J. Ramsdell, 22 August [1871]"
