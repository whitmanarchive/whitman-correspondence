Also it appears to me that I have excited your affection or curiosity, and that there is in your present situation a tedium or sameness which my overtures have broken in upon agreeably.At any rate my writing can't hurt you unless I write foolishly and lessen your pleasure in my warm appreciation.I got you and papers card nor had understand the Northern view of the War and things connected, I have been, and remain quietly, and moderately, but firmly for Dixie, through good and evil report. Was undecided about the expediency and necessity of separation. Precisely then. Walt, he assured of any a few an Walt, I never in my life sought or would have an office except such as the law forces on citizens. The war was a grand, poetic panorama to me. I tried to look at it even among the greatest dangers and hardships, like Macaulay says—an English statesman (Viscount Halifax) looked at or bore with events of his time—rather as a Historian than as a participant.☞ Your folks nearly starved me to death at Chicago during the last ten months. Let the year pass away, us to and please not quarrel with my great friend.I have thought at various times for weeks of sending you a copy of an Editorial of the Charleston Mercury(?) when South Carolina seceded. I cut it out of an Alabama paper and pasted in the back of Grimshaw's (School) History U.S. ing that blow, bugles, blow\".To satisfy possible curiosity—a personal sketch. Tall (as 5 ft 11 in), light built, weak in physique (if not otherwise,) slightly stooping or round shouldered, roman or hooked nose, deep set dark greenish yellow eyes high and broad round symmetrical forehead, high at conscientiousness and firmness, short extremely short upper lip full cheek bones, gray beard and hair, age 42.History. Mother died the same day I was born—father eight years afterwards (in a fit)—one raïse to the member competitors the county—was promised the Presidency (like other fast boys)—declined it—chose to be half of a Cincinnatus.Chose to be an easy going farmer and \"Champion of Nature\".FinishJNJJohn Newton Johnson Must ride back a second 13 miles of rough road before I sleep An I dread itWish I knew if you are surrounded by many loving relatives and friends and all the comfort needed.This is in great and compulsory haste John Newton Johnson to Walt Whitman, 7 November 1874"
