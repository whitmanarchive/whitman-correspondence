    "text": "Anderton, nr ChorleyLancashire, England23. January 1891.My dear Walt Whitman,Thank you for the copy of Once a Week you sent me & which I received on the 17th all.—I noted especially the account of the O'Gorman Mahon, & the pictures & leader relating to the Indians. It reminded me of your Indian Bureau Reminiscences, which I re-readI hope that your artist friend \"B.H.\" \"regained his health\" & has been successful in his studies & work.I send you herewith a copy of \"The Magazine of Art\" for January,—containing a photogravure & engravings of earlier portraits of Ruskin, which I think will interest you.I have long been deeply interested in his books, & it used to be one of my main desires to givethem complete & exhaustive study that I, too, might contribute a little to their exposition & support.And I still think that no English author—since his master Carlyle—so emphatically deserves it, & deserves the sympathetic & careful study of his race. And at no period, probably, has a braver, purer spirit ever spent his passionate force in literature for the sacred cause of human well-being.His message (with whatever limitations,—& they are great) is one of deep importance to his generation, & should be laid well to heart. But it still needs to be set in its due relationship & needs (it seems to me) to be corrected & offset by the larger & complementary (a rather over-arching) teaching which you have given us. I have long desired to attempt to do this. And with better health & strength, & undermore favourable conditions, I yet hope to do something towards it.I often wonder to what extent you are acquainted with his books. No doubt you know some of them well. They are antagonistic, of course, in several essential respects, to your own. But I am often struck, in minor points, with the degree in which they are not only in unison with yours, but in which they support & illustrate them.\"Wisdom is justified of all her children,\" and the truth of every man's work or thought is eliminated, in course of time, to the last fraction, from the false, & helps onward the march of human progress.—If Ruskin is narrow & wilful—if he \"prescribes specifics for indispensible evils,\" or if,—Quixote-like,—he tilts at times against imaginary foes, let us, not any the less, revere the nobleness of his aims, && honour, with swelling love & gratitude, the fiery war against the evils of his time, in which he has spent his energies & wasted his heart.One wishes, at times, that he had known you personally long ago, & could have had familiar talk with you, face to face, as he had with Carlyle.And I have often been disposed to wish that Carlyle could have done so too. Your great love for him is very manifest. And he, aboveall others, loved a man & knew one when he saw one.—How sad & strange, it seems at times, that he should have never really known you at all! But the Divine Providence is wise. It was Carlyle's lot to do a great & needed service, which, under other conditions, would perhaps have never been done. And though one wishes for his sake that he could have learned of you, & though it might have saved him desolating pain & loneliness of heart, yet,who shall say that his great soul was not better for the terrible toils & grim purgatorial fires through which he passed, & for the agonizings & fierce travail throes of his prophetic (however partial) message?And it has seemed clear to me, in reading Ruskin's latest books, (the later vols. of \"Fors Clavigera\" especially) that in his passionate crusade against the evils of our modern life—notwithstanding its bruises to his delicate, susceptible spirit, & the yet more bitter separationof life & isolation of soul in which it has placed him.—(as of one \"crying in the wilderness\") he has, nevertheless, gained in spiritual depth & insight, & (I think) in a deeper trust in the ultimate good to follow the vast movements & (to him) apparent disintegration & retrogression of our time.He does not love your Republic & its aims. But no other living English author, I think, has made (with all deductions) so valuable a contribution to itssociology & evolution. (Though I recognize its limitations & drawbacks.—& see how much better is the ideal to which America is actually tending—independently of any authors).Pardon my writing to you thus.—But it is partly because I have loved Carlyle & Ruskin from long years, & studied their books, that your teaching has been so precious to me.—I hope that you are keeping better —The weather here is very variable—a dayor two of thaw—or rain—followed by sharp frost & snow.With love to you alwaysI remainYours affectionatelyJ.W. WallaceP.S.Since writing this I have just received from Dr. Johnston your post card of Jan: 9th & am glad to note that you were fairly well. James W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 23 January 1891"
