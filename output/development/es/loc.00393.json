    "text": "JamaicaApril 16th 1860Dear Brother Walt,I was at home yesterday as usual  everything is going on about the same. Andrew has recovered in a great measure, so that he sits up and would probably have been out-doors but the weather has been very wet and cold here for the last week. Mother herself I think is not very well. she has a bad cold that seems to pull her down. I have got one of the worst colds I ever had, and feel extremely unlike myself, still anything of that kind sits lighter on me than on one of Mother's age, and this morning Ed. seemed to be quite sick, that is he couldn't eat and complained of a bad pain in his side, however Mother put a mustard plaster on him and he felt considerably better when I left home.Mattie and George, the rest of \"the family\" are well. The Mr Brown who has rented the lower part of the house has sent a number of things to the house, carpets &c. Mother has let him fix the front parlor and she has emigrated and taken posession[possession] of your room. The Moore people have not moved yet, and I believe do not intend to till 7 of MayThe Water Works men are all trembling in our boots, the [prospects?] being that we are all going to be kicked out, neck and heels, from the chief down to the Axeman. It seems that Mr F. Spinola started a bill at Albany some time last winter trying to oust the new commissioners (King, Lewis &c &c)  well someone made an amendment casting out the present old Com. the new Com. Chief Eng. &c all the way through, and appointing Mr McElroy in place of Mr Kirkwood. It has passed one house, and I guess the chances are abt[about] even for its passing the other, as Wells the Contractor is helping it with all the power he can muster. I think it will be a dark day for the B. W. W. if he succeeds, but I suppose to the victor belongs the spoils. I know I ain't going to worry, if it does go through. Mother wants me to be sure and tell you that you must bring her one of those books by the authoress of \"Consuelo\" also Redpath's \"John Brown\"  she says you needn't send them as that would involve cost, but to surely remember to bring them with you when you come home.I read your letter at home. I am glad that you are having so good a time and that your book has such a good prospect of success. I sincerely hope you will meet with no disappointment.Write me again Walt. I like much to hear how you are getting along. I shall write to you again probably next week. Mattie sends her love.Your affectionate Brother Jeff. Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 16 April 1860"
