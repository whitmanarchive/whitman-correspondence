The affairs of the meter look flourishing though there is a great deal to do yet before we get it fairly started. The weather with us keeps wonderful, pleasant. I had a long letter today from O'Connor\" he seems wonderfully bright and lively considering—His letter was all about you & Donnelly. He sticks to you like a grand fellow as he is. The last news from Pardee is not good, still I do not know that he is really worse—I cannot make out much of a letter today topics are scarce and I am probably somewhat stupid.—I have been thinking over the \"Riddle Song\" and have made up my mind that the answer is \"Good Cause\" or \"Old Cause\" or some other words meaning about the same thing.—?—Your friendRM BuckeSee notes Aug 31, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 29 August 1888"
