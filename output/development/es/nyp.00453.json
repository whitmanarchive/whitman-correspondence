    "text": "431 Stevens Street Camden New JerseyNov:November 12 '821882—Sunday a. m.It is the same publishing, only under a different name. The man who runs Rees Welsh's business, (the chief mate of the ship) and who first proposed & put through the bargain last June with me—David McKay—has formally bo'tbought out & assumed R W's miscellaneous & publishing & secondhand books business—& is now & henceforth the publisher of L of GLeaves of Grass and S DSpecimen Days—drops into Rees Welsh's shoes—It is just as well—& is indeed to me no change—for really my doings have been with McKMcKay all along from the beginning—S. D.Specimen Days sales rather sluggish—(1500 were printed, towards 400 remain on the shelves in 23 Ninth St.)—I have rec'dreceived a long letter from Ezra H Heywood—dated Princeton, Mass:Massachusetts—Heywood has been arrested by Comstock—part at least of the cause appears to be sending printed slips by mail with \"to a common prostitute\" and \"a woman waits for me\"—supplements to Heywood's paper \"the Word\"—(I believe I will just enclose H's letter—slips & all)—My impression is that Comstock's chief object is to get, (by snap judgment probably) a judicial decision on which he can base a show to go before the P. M. General, (as per the late decision of P.M.G. in such questions)—the hearing is to come off before U.S. Commissioner Hallett in Boston, Nov 16—(As to the vehement action of the Free religious & lover folk, in their conventions, papers &c in my favor—and even proceedings like these of Heywood—I see nothing better for myself or friends to do than quietly stand aside & let it go on)—what do you think?As I write, it is a cloudy moist warmish Sunday, 10¼ a. m. pleasant—quiet here—I am up in my 3d story, south-front room, writing this—There is a long & supercilious notice of S. D.Specimen Days in N. Y.New York World, Oct 30, I wonder if written by Hurlbert himself?—an emanation of that New York nest of little malignants, (Stoddard, little Winter, and half a dozen more)—The Boston Herald some weeks since (Oct: 15) had a lengthy and very warm notice, very judicious extracts (Sylvanus Baxter, author)—the best I have seen from the book's own standpoint (which of course is every thing)—Are you then going to make a brochure of the Tribune letters? Good, if so—Shall I furnish you with more detailed and verbatim data of the Osgood transaction & correspondence—or have you them sufficiently?Where is Ashton? Is he there in W. & do you see him? If so tell him I have not forgotten him—& that I send him & Mrs. A. my love—In a late note I ask'dasked you, if eligible, to send me Charley Eldridge's address—☛ Do you know what ducks & drakes are? Well, S. D.Specimen Days is a rapid skimming over the pond-surface of my life, thoughts, experiences, that way—the real area altogether untouch'duntouched, but the flat pebble making a few dips as it flies & flits along—enough at least to give some living touches and contact-points—I was quite willing to make an immensely negative book.I am holding my own in the recovery of my half state of health—am contemplating some change of base, (residence, domicile—sometimes I have thought of coming to Washington, settling there, getting a lot & small house in fee simple)—Have you sent Dowden's letter to Dr Bucke? I got a letter from Dr Channing asking me to lecture in the Tilton sisters' course this winter in Boston—but I cannot lecture at present—besides I shall certainly not do any thing to identify myself specially with free love—W WWrite often as you can—the days are quite stagnant with me—(a spell at any rate)— Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 12 November 1882"
