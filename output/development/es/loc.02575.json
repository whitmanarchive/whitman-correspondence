    "text": "The Lotos Club.New York.Sept 22/90Dear WaltReading your letter over again—let me say—There was no solicitation whatever on my part—Ingersoll and I were talking about you. I remarked that I was sorry his speech of last May was not saved.Then your condition of health, and then he said, \"Why not get up a lecture. The results to go to Whitman,\" andI said \"you just authorize me to proceed and the thing will be done. That's all. It's all right, you may rest assured—As to New York or Phil, I wish it might be here & if you could come over, we would cram the Opera House. Could you come? If not, then Phil, by all means, but you must bepresent. Ingersoll is enthused, and it will be a grand culmination—No one lives who will better handle the subject or make it a great occasion.Sincerely YoursJH Johnston John H. Johnston to Walt Whitman, 22 September 1890"
