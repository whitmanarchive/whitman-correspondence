    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,16 Oct 1888Your letter of 13th is just to hand. I have looked over \"N.B.\" a good deal since I wrote you last and like the little volume better all the time. The \"Backward Glance\" I consider very valuable, the \"Sands\" still more so—I should be sorry to lose any of it. That is the main point about the \"Complete Works\" to have an authoratative text which can be relied on every time as what the Author intended to say. I finished my Annual Report Sunday and mailed it yesterday—am at work now on \"Lectures on Psycology & mental diseases\" for the medical students here. Wm Gurd left for N.Y. yesterday—if all is well I expect him to want me down in two to three weeks—so far all looks well for the meter I am only anxious about getting it patented all over i.e. in Europe as well as America. We are having such stormy weather—it was a little better this morning until the last few minutes now it has set in to blow and rain at a great rate—I am uneasy about O'Connor too, I fear he is quite sick, should you get word from him or of him be sure to let me know—I trust it will not be more than 2 to 3 weeks before I shall see you again.Love to youRM BuckeSee notes Oct 18 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 16 October 1888"
