    "text": "328 Mickle StreetCamden New JerseyMarch 18 '86Dear friendI send to-day by mail the three Vols. of your Emerson so long detained—deepest apologies for not returning them before—I don't know that I have any thing to tell you of any account. I am not writing any thing. Have a small screed of three or four pages to appear in A T Rice's forthcoming Reminiscences of Lincoln, but I consider it unworthy the theme. James Redpath, who manages things for A T R, has been very good to me—persistently so—& it is to his urgency I have responded—Have not yet finished the Army Hospital article for the Century, but intend to do so forthwith. Had a violent spell of illness ab'tabout a week ago—remained in bed all last Friday—am up since, & go out a little, but don't feel even as half-well as usual. Beautiful here to-day & I am enjoying the sunshine, sitting here by the window, looking out—Have read my Death of Abraham Lincoln paper twice this spring, on applications ($25 and $30)—got along with it rather slowly, but didnt[didn't] break down, & seems to have given a sort of satisfaction—Want to scoop up what I have (poems and prose) of the last MSS since 1881 and '2, & put in probably 200 page book (or somewhat less) to be called perhaps November Boughs—I am getting along comfortably enough here—spirits generally good—my old horse has quite given out—we have a canary bird, dog, & parrot—all great friends of mine (& teachers)—Best love to you & 'Sula—not forgetting the little boy—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 18 March 1886"
