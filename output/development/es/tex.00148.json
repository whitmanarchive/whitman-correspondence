    "text": "ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington,April 23, 1866 Dearest Mother,I received your letter on Saturday—I am well as usual—shall write to Han to-day—Mother, write soon as convenient after you get this, as I shall want to know if it reached you all right—I have no doubt George will do well in his business—of course there will be slack times once in a while—I have seen the \"Radical\"—Mother, I sometimes think the old letter carrier you had, must be the thief—We have fine weather, plenty of rain to keep down the dust. We had the greatest black procession here last Thursday—I didn't think there was so many darkeys, (especially wenches,) in the world—it was the anniversary of emancipation in this District—Mother, you must try to take the moving [cooly]—Well I believe that is all this time—Good bye, dearest mother—Love to sister Mat & the little girls. Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 23 April 1866"
