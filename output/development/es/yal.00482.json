    "text": "Camden New JerseySept: 20 '90Dear friend J H J—have just heard by Horace traubel that (thro' you) Col. Ingersoll favors the idea of a public meeting & address ab't me—(get the notion that he has been solicited or even persuaded—wh' I don't like at all—not warranted or authorized by me, at any rate—but let that pass)—If this is so ab't Col. I's design I myself think the best place would be New York City, tho' I believe Horace & some other friends believe Phila: best—Of course I don't know what Col I's drift and vein may be, but I know it w'd be grand, & something I sh'd be proud of—On the impulse of the moment I have gather'd these items enclosed & send to you, to give all the note (with scraps enclosed all as it is) to Col. I with my respects, thanks, & love—I shall give the whole proposed meeting, address &c: into his and y'r & the friends' hands—without any meddling by me—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to John H. Johnston, 20 September 1890"
