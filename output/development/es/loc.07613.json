    "text": "CamdenMay 2 '89Feeling ab't fairly—weather not unpleasant, cloudy, & a little cool—am sitting here by the oak fire—a middling fair bowel action an hour ago, I go out to the closet myself & return—Horace has been in—the L of G. pocket-book ed'n is getting along—(probably the press-work to-day—also some of the plates at the plate press)—Well the big N Y show seems to have all pass'd over successfully—to me the idea of it is good, even grand, but I have not enthused ab't it at all—(may be a whim, but the most insignificant item in the whole affair has been Harrison himself, President for all he is)—So the circus here was a success last night—Ed enjoy'd it hugely—& I suppose Dr Baker has gone off (to Minneapolis) immediately after his graduation—Mrs. Davis was there—Osler spoke well & was treated to great applause—all this in the Phila: Academy wh' must have look'd gayly—I have been looking over the May Century, the Book News and the Critic (so I may be supposed to be posted with current literature)—read Whittier's long N Y centennial ode—also Wyatt Eaton's reminiscences (interesting) of J F Millet—the \"cold in the head\" still upon me palpably—stew'd chicken, Graham bread & coffee for my meals lately—Ed gives me a good currying every evening—Sleep fairly—Sun bursting forth as I write—the great long burr-r-r of the Phila. whistles from factories or shores often & plainly here sounding, & I rather like it—(blunt & bass)—some future American Wagner might make something significant of it—Guess you must have all good times there—occupied & healthy & sufficiently out door—I refresh myself sometimes thinking (fancying) ab't you all there—I enclose Mrs. O'C[onnor]'s yesterday's card—I send card or something every evn'g—Love to you, Mrs B & the childer—W WY'rs of April 30 rec'd— Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 2 May 1889"
