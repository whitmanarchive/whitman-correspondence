    "text": "Advertiser OfficeBostonAug. 1 1887My dear Sir:I have lately been spending happy days with my dear friend, Rev Samuel Longfellow, beneath the shadow of the Old Man of the Mountain in the Franconia Notch. Returning home I found on my table the papers and pamphlet, and photogravure photograph of yourself, which you sent to me. The portrait hangs now on my wall in my little book-lined den at Waltham, where I may see it whenever I raise my eyes from my work. I wish to thank you in the warmest terms for your very considerable and much appreciated gift. Never before, believe me, have I experienced anything that pleased me more. And the picture especially and O'Connor's pamphlet I shall always cherish as most precious expressions of regard from one whom I honor before all other writers of our land. To have written anything that could please you is a satisfaction which I highly prize. I had a letter a week ago from a Spaniard in Avila, Spain. This, which he said, you will be glad to hear: \"Kant, Lucretius, Swinburne , Musset, Goethe, & Walt Whitman make up my library.\" When is the new volume of poems to come to us? With profound gratitude for your especial notice of my faulty work, and a deep sense of obligation for the intellectual stimulus that your poems have given to me, I am Most faithfully yours,Wm Morton Fullerton William Morton Fullerton to Walt Whitman, 1 August 1887"
