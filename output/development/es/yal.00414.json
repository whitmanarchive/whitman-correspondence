    "text": "Department of Justice, Office of the Solicitor of the Treasury, Washington, D. C.,Wednesday noon, April 16, 187 . Dearest mother,I have had one or two quite good spells—but am not feeling well just now—have got over to the office, & am now sitting at my desk—it is a rainy day here, not very cool—Mother, I have nothing particular to write to-day either—but thought I would send just a few lines, as you might like to get something—The season is quite advanced here—pleasant the past few days, I have been out in the cars every day. I have not written very lately either to Jeff or Hannah—Well, Mammy dear, how are you getting along at Camden—& how are Lou and George—I often wish you were here, mother dear, as it would be such a relief to me to have you where I could see you, & talk a while—I think there is no doubt that, take the time right through, I gain steadily, though very slowly indeed—but I get many tedious spells, both of head & limbs—there seems to be great deal of paralysis—I hear, or read of cases, every day—One man here to-day told me of his father, who had a very bad stroke at 70 years of age, but got over it after all, and lived 17 or 18 years after, by great care—So I hear of many cases, some good, some unfavorable—As to myself, I do not lose faith for a moment, in my ultimate recovery—though, as I said, I have some bad hours—sometimes very bad—Well, mama dear, I have scribbled out this sheet nearly, such as it is—I sent you a letter last Monday—I have changed the address on the envelopes to you, mother, as you see—is it right?—I am feeling better—my head is some easier—Love to you, dear mama, & all—Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 16 April [1873]"
