    "text": "New York CityAugust 25, 1866.Dear friend, The letters arrive safe—I have received three—& I am much obliged to you, Andy, for your attention. I am having good times here, rather quiet—My book is being printed—gets along rather slowly. I ride out on Long Island, & up New York, Central Park, &c. occasionally—the country is beautiful now—I take a walk on Broadway almost every afternoon—then sometimes a sail on the river or bay—so you see I am enjoying myself in my way—with three or four hours work every day reading my proofs, &c—Andy, I suppose you are all getting along as usual—I enclose a line to Mat, which please give him—I send my love to you, Frank, Mat & Lewis—& for present, Farewell.WaltP.S. Andy, should any more letters come, you may direct them to me at 279 East 55th st. New York City—I expect to return about 12th Sept.Finally, I must not neglect to impress upon your youthful mind—also upon that of Mr. F. Stitt—the original & solemn advice, \"Be virtuous—& you will be happy.\"—from your Christian friend—Walter. Walt Whitman to Andrew Kerr, 25 August 1866"
