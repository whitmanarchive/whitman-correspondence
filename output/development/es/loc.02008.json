I know it.Nothing that I ever read so filled me with joy and gladnessSitting solitary in the forest, bathed in the warm sunlight with the cool breeze whispering to me, I know that we are akin and am thankful. I take the kiss you give. I know it was especially for meYou will take my kisses and love as from me that knows you and can never forget youI have received so much that I must make some return be it ever so little.John Burroughs more than any oneanyone that I know, fitly expresses my thought of you. I love him for it.I have never met any oneanyone that seemed to have the faintest understanding of you so I keep you all to myself locked in my heart of hearts.Kate A. Evans.from the Californian Kate Evans (? rather gushing) Kate A. Evans to Walt Whitman, 2 August 1877"
