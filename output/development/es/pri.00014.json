    "text": "Walt Whitman to William Rossetti3651961431 Stevens st.Streetcor West.Camden,N.New Jersey,U.S. AmericaJan.January 26. /761876My dear friend,I send you the enclosed piece (printed in a paper here, with my consent) —quite willing you should have it put, if convenient, in the Academy, or any other literary gazette, your way, if thought proper. My theory is that the plain truth of the situation here is best stated. It is even worse than described in the article. With me, things are going on as for a year or two past—am no worse—work a little—still remain in Camden. I rec'dreceived your letter—have seen of late months Joaquin Miller, M. D.Moncure D. Conway, Lord Houghton, &c I have lately heard from, but not seen, Marvin, my Boston friend. John Burroughs was here with me last week. He is well. I have about got ready my two Volumes—\"Leaves of Grass\" remains about the same, (a few new bits) \"Two Rivulets,\" the other Vol.Volume, has some new stuff—will write further to you soon anent of the books. Was interested & pleased with your letter about the dinner—sent it to Marvin to read. I have seen Peter Bayne's piece—have also seen the friendly & glowing article of Arthur Clive in the Gentleman's Magazine. Who is A. C.?—When you write tell me something about him. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William Michael Rossetti, 26 January 1876"
