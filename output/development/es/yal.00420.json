Dear Linton,My note of yesterday, (or day before,) asking for the bill was written in the midst of a splitting headache—& without fully reading yours. To-day, better, I have just taken up yours to read a second time, (as I generally do with my friends' letters,) & see your kind & friendly gift to me of the prints—which I accept with thanks & pleasure. Two days now of fine weather—which I fancy is telling on me, as well as on the frozen ground & sap in the trees—Love to you—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William J. Linton, 28 March [1875]"
