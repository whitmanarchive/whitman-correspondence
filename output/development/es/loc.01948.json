    "text": "PascackMar. 9th 1874Mr. WhitmanDear SirI received your letter some three weeks ago, but have not had much chance to answer it until now. I am alone at home, with my brothers—Papa & Mother are gone visiting to Uncle John's Father's-in-law.Garrie and I have been to school to daytoday—the teacher was pretty cross.A great many people are dying around here this winter and spring. I attended two funerals yesterday. Our undertaker hd[had] six orders for coffins last Saturday.An old gentleman 65 years of age, was coming to our house with a basket of eggs, for papa to take to Paterson to market, when he fell down in the road, and expired in an hour or two.Papa, George & I had quite a tramp last week—we went to New York Monday morning with the first train and came back Tuesday night. Monday morning we went to Fulton Ferry, and found Uncle George at work, driving stage—We went up town in his stage, & then walked up to the Park, where we spent about 2 Hours—saw a great many anamiles[animals], a few birds, &c, &c., but the monkeys, were best, of all—We then went down town, and got dinner, then walked up broadwayBroadway to 14th St.Street here we met Uncle George, on his way down town, and Papa went with him, while George, & I went to a Museum of Art—We saw a great many things to amuse us, such as paintings, sculptures on wood & on stone, ancient armour, ancient dishes, Books, &c. &c. When we came from there we went to the corcorner of 14th st.street & B.wayBroadway, to meet Papa—we then walked around, seeing all we could, till we got very tired—then we went and sat down awhile, & then up to 43rd st.street to meet Uncle George—then we soon went to bed.Tuesday we took the street cars & went to the Park, walked through the Park & took the street cars to High Bridge. Here we saw a fine structure—we were there awhile & then took the Hnd. R. R R to 43rd st.street. We now got down towndowntown, over the ferry, & home.I have written this, but don't[don't] know if it will interest you or not.There fell some snow Friday, & is not gone yet, it is quite cold. Garrie, Georgi , Dick, & Mary, are amusing themselves by riding one another around the room, on their Backs.Now, I have written a good long letter, & you must answer it soon.I hope you will improve with the warm weather.So Good Byefrom your loving friendWalt.Walter Whitman Storms.P.S. I gave Uncle George the letter you sent me, & he said he would write to you, but if he will or not I do not know. Walter Whitman Storms to Walt Whitman, 9 March 1874"
