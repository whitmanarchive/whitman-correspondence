    "text": "Asylum for the Insane,London,20th March 1883My dear WaltI have this afternoon received, read, and remailed to you galleys 37 to 45 inclusive. I open and read these parcels of proof in fear and trembling (you must go as easy as you can, you are the terrible surgeon with the knife & saw and I am the patient). You left out my remarks on \"Children of Adam\", I believe they were good but I acquiesce—your additions are excellent as they have been all through. I shall not feel half comfortable untill[until] I have had the proof of the rest of ppart ii and have seen how much of me will be left. Poor O'Connor too, he had to submit to the fatal shears—but you are going to make a book of it (if that be possible) so go ahead if we do flinch. But still, for the Lord's sake, spare my ch iii pt ii as much as possible. I want you, please (if I am not speaking to[too] late) to save the M.S. and send it all to me when you are done with it. I shall be glad to have plate proofs as fast as made, if I see any thing in them that needs correcting will notify you otherwise will just put them by—I suppose you do not want them returned? It is still winter here, lots of snow, good sleighing,R M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 20 March 1883"
