    "text": "Cambridge, Mass5 De Wolf st May 12 Dr. Mr. Whitman— Our literary people are all agog over Mr. Howell's attempted dethronement of Scott, and the preference which he assigns to Tolstoi over the \"Wizard of the North. Mr. Howell's has used a portion of your general indictment of all the old-world literature that they are saturated in the aristocratic spirit and lack that enthusiasum for democracy which the coming literature must have. Could you not give the public your views on the subject which is now cleaving literary Boston in twain? If you would not do this would you be so kind as to give me your private view—I would not publish it if you so desired. If you desired to submit a ms. on the subject to the papers or magazines here I would be glad to present it for you and would get you the best possible terms. You do not now remember me—I therefore give as references—Mr A.H. Stephenson 214 Chestnut St Philadelphia—or Rev. Dr. A.A. Livermore Meadville, Pa. Very Sincerely John B. Barnhill. John B. Barnhill to Walt Whitman, 12 May 1889"
