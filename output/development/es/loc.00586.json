    "text": "Rocky MountainsJan 8th 1862Friend WaltPerhaps you have forgotten a wild farmer's scarecrow man who used to linger around Thayer & Eldridges Publishing office Boston in the spring of 1860 But he still remembers you and has been waiting very patiently for a volume of Leaves of Grass which was to be sent to Lawrence Kansas Perhaps you think I am writing rather familiar for almost a stranger and writing to a distinguished Poet but I think I have made a sufficient appology[apology] when I tell you I have been in the Rocky Mountains for almost two years where every man is an old acquaintance if you never saw him beforeWhen I left Boston I came to Kansas and from there out here among Grizzly bears, Indians Yankees and almost every species of man and beast that inhabit the globe. I have lived on venison and I have lived on bread I have gone hungry for many a day and have had plenty to eat for many more, and for all the hardships I have seen it suits me, I like it  I enjoy myself hugely, and I think you would do the sameI now hold the position of 1st Lieut of Co K 1st Reg ColColorado Vols and suppose I shall be a soldier for the next few yearsI have often heard Leaves of Grass highly spoken of away out here but have never seen a volume until a few days ago and the man who has that will not dispose of that for any price he brought it out with him to this country.I am in an old log shanty to night away up in the mountains about forty miles from the valley the wind blows a perfect hurracanehurricane and it is cold as Greenland I am writing by the light of a pitch pine fire, it is past twelve oclock and I must go to bed as I must start for the valley in the morning. I dont[don't] want you to forget to answer this. Good nightYours &cSilas S. SouleP.S. Please direct Lieut S. S. SouleCamp Weld DenverCol Silas S. Soule to Walt Whitman, 8 January 1862"
