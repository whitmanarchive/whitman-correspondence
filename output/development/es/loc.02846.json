Very glad to hear of S[ula] having got home \"well & hearty\"—Sheets you speak of, not yet come to hand. I am better this winter, seems almost decidedly—banged bad enough yet, but the bad deathly spells are very rare, (almost unknown) the last three months—I want to go to N Y city in January—to J H Johnstons (in 10th street)—his jewelry store is at 150 Bowery, cor Broome—call & see him—quite a lull in my book selling, & in my affairs, & literary doings, generally—W W Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 20 December [1876]"
