    "text": "NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. (EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT.) (DICTATED TO STENOGRAPHER.)NEW YORK,July 16th1885.Walt Whitman,Camden, N.J.Dear Walt Whitman: I got your letter when I was in Washington and fully expected to stay over and see you on my return, but I was kept so much longer than I thought I would be kept and so much more work was thrown on me that I was compelled to hurry back to New York by night. It is possible that I may be in Philadelphia this week—indeed it is probable—and in that case I shall certainly cross the ferry; but in the meantime why should you be idle? I shall not presume to give you any hints as to how to write; I think you know what I want:—1st. Lincoln: Mr. Rice has got the ambition of editing a work that can never be superseded. He proposes to get every man of note now living who ever met Lincoln to write down in plain words and as accurately as the human memory will record, just what Lincoln did; just how Lincoln looked; just what impression Lincoln made on him. However, he does not want the last clause (that is to say, the impressions) recorded by anybody but only by men whose names will go down to history. Like Gradgrind, \"what he wants is facts.\" You, of course, are among the favored few whose impressions will be acceptable; so, you see, if you will write down an account of every interview you ever had with Lincoln, that will complete what I ask of you in his name on that subject. 2d Memoires of the War. He would like from you an account of some phase of the Civil War which you witnessed. But I will see you before you have time, probably, to write the second article, and, possible, I may be able to suggest the best topic from his point of view to begin with. Now, my dear Walt Whitman, won't you go to work at once because Rice is chained lightning in a dress suit and damned impatient. Yours Ever,Jas Redpathsee notes July 29 1888 | also Aug 1stfrom Jas Redpath abt articles on Lincoln and on War incidents | both articles sent accepted & paid for James Redpath to Walt Whitman, 16 July 1885"
