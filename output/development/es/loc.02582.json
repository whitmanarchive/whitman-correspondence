    "text": "1929 north 22d StreetPhilaPhiladelphia:June 20Dear boy Jack,I thought of coming round to see you all last Sunday, but it was so hot & I didn't get over to Camden—didn't feel like walking up from the ferry—Jack I am stopping up here in 22d street for a week or two—they are very kind to me, & very jovial & we have real good times—the young man, about 21, he & I are very thick—then there are two grown daughters—the eldest one is a first class trump, she is my favorite every way—she is studying at the woman's Medical University here—the mother Mrs Gilchrist, is a very fine lady,—we have good meals, & take our time over them—I have the best room in the house, breezy & cool (& the water in it)—& a young English college Professor, Mr Carpenter, is staying here for a few days—though a stranger he is a great friend of mine & indeed has come over from England to see me—(But I have written enough of all that—Dear Jack I wonder if I shall ever be with you, or rather have you with me, so that we can have some good times together on land or water—I used to think of having a shanty of my own there in Camden, & I thought I shouldn't be satisfied without having you & Ida up there to take supper with me two evenings in the week at least—I wonder if it is ever coming to pass— Mean time I shall come around next Sunday, if you are all at home—Tell Ida to put her hair in curl papers Saturday night—& though I do not wish the fatted calf slaughtered on Sunday morning—I hope there will be some spear mint ready to pull in the garden—Johnny how does it go with you?—Love to mother & father & tell 'em I'm coming round next Sunday—Here is a kiss for you, Jack, & take care of yourself, & don't forget your loving friendOld W W Walt Whitman to John R. Johnston, 20 June [1877]"
