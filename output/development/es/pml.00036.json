    "text": "Wednesday noon—Jan 3. Dearest mother,Your letter of Sunday night came this morning—it seems indeed \"after a storm comes a calm\"—You must have had quite an exciting week—still I think it must have been kind of good to have had George and Lou home—was Lou as kind and helpful as ever? About being alone, if you feel as I do about it, it is a satisfaction to be by one's self, as you grow old—(though perhaps not too much)—I was glad to hear about little Jim & Georgey—I am glad the Stantons are gone—they would only have been a continual nuisance—Mama, I shall come home, (if nothing happens more than at present known) and stay two months, & then return here to my place—I shall write in good time before—Mama dear, you must try to take as much comfort as you can—I hope Gracie comes in frequently—& Mrs. Mormon too—(she seems to me a good neighbor)—Walt.This is the 2d letter this week— Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 3 January [1872]"
