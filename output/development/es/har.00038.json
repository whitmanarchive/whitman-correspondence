I am afraid from what I have noticed in the papers, that you have not been in good health of late, but I trust that you are now strong again, and able to give the old friends of your youth a line from your gifted pen, on this, as well as many future annual reunions.With sincere regardsVery Respectfully YoursJohn W. Wiggins Jr. John W. Wiggins, Jr. to Walt Whitman, 24 March 1888"
