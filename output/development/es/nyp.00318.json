I am still improving— (I don't feel quite as well to-day as for some days past— but it is a great advance on what I have been)—& am in good spirits— Dear mother, I feel very anxious about you—it is very distressing to have the nervous system affected, it always makes one feel so discouraged, that is the worst of it—Mother, I am afraid you are more unwell than you say—I think about it night & day— the enclosed letter came to me yesterday—Jeff sent it to me, by mistake (may-be one for me has gone to you)—I got another letter from Jeff to-day—all are well—Jeff too is anxious about you— Mother, try to write a line soon after you get this—I am writing this in the office—Mother, I shall come on— Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 13 May [1873]"
