    "text": "Chicago, 21 Soflas StSept. 2Dear W—I was pleased to get your brief word about yourself, even though you report your imprisonment. I am glad you have been able to bring your books so near completion. No one could have done it but yourself with the same satisfaction to your friends.There seems to be a sort of providence in one's life who has the courage to peg away, & to wait, when he can't peg. Somehow the pegging gets done at what finally seems to have been the right & opportune moment; & the world abides.One has no business to be disappointed, or to stay so long—He don't know. The Enquirer cries \"stop\"—\"cant be\"—\"wait\" \"get sick—stay sick\"—\"die\" \"Dont die\"—\"start up\"—\"at it now\"—\"There! See?—How easy? What was your fuming about?\"—\"Now, a good laugh before you die.—All's well!\"This to the Ideal worker.The \"business man\" with possessions rash (won or to be won) has his turbulations, but of another sort.No such humiliations—and no such victims!I went yesterday to hear Prof Swing preach. If you dont know about him, Horace will tell you. He said some bright things. One: \"Many promising lad goes through Cambridge & Oxford & on through time into oblivion quoting his Greek & Latin. And many a poor unfriended boy rises up out of the gutter where he was born & climbs into the heights of knowledge & wisdom. Verily the Spirit cares for its own.\" (Or words to this effect). Chicago has better preachers than Boston. There is greater inspiration in their utterances. They seem to be spiritually more awake—alert. Foreglancing, foreseeing! The great, vast bulk of of a city weighs on the senses like a nightmare, but if one doesnt care a button for his fine senses, he can escape into a great liberation of music & spirit. \"What is your city with its temples & walls? I can tear it all down & build it again in three days,\" said Jesus.How the old sense-ridden Jew must have glowered & foamed!\"Why, it would take a hundred years to build the walls alone.\"Chicago has been a building for 50 years only. And what a wonderful spread it has made! I like it, I enjoy it. The boulevards stretching miles miles white & clean— yea, as far as the eye can reach, make me stop & look up & down there a long time. I dont care much for the great buildings—from the tops of some of them you can almost touch the moon. I like to get on the grip-car & ride through the long tunnel—every now & then a rick with a small electric light. Everybody was saying \"Look out for the grip-car or you'll get killed. So many have.\"Ha, ha, ha! What cowards these people be! Make things, & then get afraid of them.The Lincoln statue is good. The face has a vast deal in it. The figure is Lincolnish. I have seen it now 3 times, & I find a little fault with it eternally standing there before that chair. The chair part is as the cities say, \"a bold conception,\" but whether tis not an infraction of the old Greek admonition, as being \"too bold?\" I believe on the whole, I would not have put it there—or anywhere. The modeling is strong, but a little too much done. The hair, however, is better than represented in the engraving & on the whole, I know of other public statue as good.But on the shirts here I find some half dozzendozen statues (Scott, Burns, & others) done by some unfamed fellow for $100 ends in grey sandstone, that far surpasses it. I find myself always stopped by them with a half defined expectancy that they are going to say something to me. By the way this stone would be just the thing for your bust. Beats marble a hundred per cent.Well, I should like to see you that I might at least lay aside this scratchy pen, & say & hear you say. But—. I have no studio yet, but am on the look for one, with some encouragement of work. Rent here is way up. Kind remembrances to your faithful housekeeper.With wishes and wishestrulyMorse Sidney H. Morse to Walt Whitman, 2 September 1888"
