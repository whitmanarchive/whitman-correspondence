    "text": "Anderton, near ChorleyLancashire, England11 Septbr 1890Dear Walt Whitman,I sent a cable message to you this aftn asking you to send me another copy of the pocket book edition of L. of G. and will enclose a money order herewith for 22/— in payment of same.The friends who have seen my copy are very much please with it, and have decided to present a copy to one of our number (Revd I.R.C. Hulton) on his birthday, the 25th inst.He has been a very useful member of our little Society of friends and is very much liked by us. Since he joined us he has become a great admirer of yours + possesses the ordinary edition of your works. So \"the boys\" have decided to celebrate his next birthday (and a recent appointment he has received) by presenting him with the new edition, + I was asked at noon to wire for one so that it may come in time.You will get this letter about the same date and we should like to feel that your thoughts + good will are with us. I have no better portrait to send, but I will enclose a newspaper portrait that appeared last Saturday (He sat next to me in the group of which we once sent you a photo) He is an old student of Browning, by whom he has been largely influenced, (in theology + otherwise) and apart from opinions—is a man of fine sensibilities, brave, unaffected, quietly devout, brotherly and loveable—already becoming a noteable man in the town.Dr Johnston met me as I came away from business tonight + shewed me the papers + copies of recent poems he had just received from you. Your continued kindnesses are very precious to us.With love to you alwaysYours affectionatelyJ. W. WallaceP.S. O. W. Holmes is repelled by what he considers your sins against the conventions. Here, by way of offset, is an English , among your fervent admirers!—P.P.S.—12 SeptbrI was very much pleased to receive your kind post card this morning + thank you heartily. I am sorry to learn that you were suffering from \"the grip\" when you woke, but hope that it has now left you altogether—We got the February number of the Universal Review when it appeared. Thank you, however, for your kind + considerate mention of it, as we wish to overlook nothing of that kind.—Tomorrow aftn (Saturday) there will be a full meeting of our little Society—at a country farm—to hear Dr J's account of his visit to you. I see from \"The Conservator\" that you have a new volume in preparation, of which I presume that the slips you have sent Dr J. are proofs.—Will you please to enrol[enroll] me as a subscriber + send me a copy when ready? I will remit cash when I know the amount.J. W. W. J.W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 11 September 1890"
