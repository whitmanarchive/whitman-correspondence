    "text": "West Park N.Y.Feb 17, 1891Dear WaltI was very glad to get your card, but sorry to hear you are under the weather. I trust the spring which is now near will set you up again. I keep pretty well, as do wife & Julian. We have been here all winter. I have been busy with my pen, turning outpot-boilers, nothing else[.] I shall keep an eye out for your N.A. article. I see it in the reading rooms in PoKeepsie[Poughkeepsie]. I have been sending some things to the Independent & to the Christian Union at the request of the editors. It is surprising how much heresy these papers can stand. I think they secretly like it. I see nothing in the literary horizon, no coming poet or philosopher[.] My opinion is that life isbecoming pretty thin. Once civilization runs all to head & cuteness, no character, no heart in anything now adays[nowadays] most of the magazine poetry is utterly barren. It is like poor mortarâ€”too much sand for the lime.I am in a hurry to see spring. I want to taste the earth again. The ground here has been deeply covered since early in Dec. Rain & fog today.With much loveJohn Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman 17 February 1891"
