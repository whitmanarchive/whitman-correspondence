I wish you could see us and be with us for a time I think it would do you good And now I must ask you about that photograph you promised me so long ago I have never seen it yet please do not let me have occasion to doubt your word though I think you agreed to write me if I wrote you if you cannot (but I hope you can) please let Fraser have one for me and he will send it for I have written him Please excuse haste, Yours with much love,Anson Ryder, Jun. Anson Ryder Jr. to Walt Whitman, 9 August 1865"
