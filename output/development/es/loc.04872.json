I have been hoping to bring it over; but I will put it off no longer and hand you the last fragment of the happiest help to another in which I have ever shared. Your postal cards were better than all the letters in the world. In joy and gratitude at the privilege of being one on whom you rely I am YoursTalcott Williams From Talcott Williams June '86 (enclosing $8) Talcott Williams to Walt Whitman, 11 June 1886"
