    "text": "SyracuseJuly 18th 1869.Dear FriendWalt WhitmanIt has been a long time since we have heard from each other and I am feeling quite anxious to hear from my kind & Loving Friend again and hear how he is getting along in this world, but I think I can imagine about how you are getting along, in just about the same way that you used to at Armory Square Hospital when your kind face & pleasant words cheered the soldier Boys & won their hearts I never shall forget the first time you came in after David & I got there We Loved you from the first time we spoke to you. But to the present. We heard from David last week he is doing first rate on a Rail Road in California & Says he will come back in a few years a rich Man. I hope he will for he is a good Boy & kind to his Old Mother he sent her $250.oo Last week which will do her a great deal of good.Father & Mother send Love to you. My little Walt is quite a big Boy most 16 months old and full of mischief, he can walk all around the house & yard & talks very little I wish you could see him.Write SoonYours with LoveB.H. Wilson Benton H. Wilson to Walt Whitman, 18 July 1869"
