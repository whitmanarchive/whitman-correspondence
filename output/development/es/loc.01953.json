    "text": "Jamestown N.Y.March 30th 1870Dear respected friendFeeling assured that any information of my doings and whereabouts will meet with only the kindest reception from you, I venture once more after a long silence, to address you.If any excuse be necessary, let my respect and esteem be that excuse.When I wrote you last I was attending the Penn. State Normal School at Edinboro. Since then I have been in the school room as a student or teacher nearly all of the time I have just finished a very nice essay on school and teachers(You once said, \"That boy has a high opinion of himself\"; but I note teaching you facts) and have just entered upon the study of Law; In consequence of my very limited means (as you know) I cannot remain in the office longer than next fall.Though we enjoyed our homeless life in Washington I think I have enjoyed my more wandering life since then somewhat better If the world gives me few pennies it at least gives me few curses, and, some kind words: Is this good philosophy?Any words of comfort you may have to send me Dear friend, in reply to this, will be to me \"like unto the shadow of a great rock in a weary land\".I do not know that this will find you immediately—you may have \"changed base\" since '68, though I trust it may.Good night kind friend—Respectfully,By.Byron SutherlandWaltWhitman Byron Sutherland to Walt Whitman, 30 March 1870"
