    "text": "BrooklynFriday, Sept. 23. Dear Pete,Your letter of last Sunday & Monday came safe—was glad to see you so cheerful & feeling well, as seemed plain by the tone of the letter. All goes right with me. I am feeling well, & business matters move along as favorably as could be expected, taking all things in consideration. The weather is elegant—We had rain here too last Saturday & Sunday—& since then it has been clear & bright—I am out dashing around every day—fetch up home every night somewhere between 10 & 1 oclock, quite tired. The river & bay get more & more beautiful, under these splendid September skies, the green waves & white foam relieved by the white sails of the crowds of ships & sail craft—for the shipping interest is brisker this fall than it has been for twelve years. Say to Harry Hurt, Mr Shedd, Pensey & George Bell, Baley Murdock, George Smith, Dr. & Wash. Milburn, or any of the railroad boys, or other friends that may inquire after me, that I send them my best respects—not forgetting my friends Mr. & Mrs. Nash—also Father Boyle—(By the bye, Pete, I have taken a great fearful drink of whiskey, in honor of the news that arrived night before last of Victor Emanuel entering Rome—I couldn't wait.) Later—afternoon—It is now between 3 and 4—I have been pitching in heavy to a great dish of stewed beef & onions mother cooked for dinner—& shall presently cross over to New York & mail this letter—shall probably go to some amusement with a friend this evening—most likely Buckleys Serenaders—Pete, dear son, I hope this will find you all right, & every thing lovely—It will not be long now before I shall be back—Till then, take care of yourself, my loving son. Walt. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 23 September [1870]"
