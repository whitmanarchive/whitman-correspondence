    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylum for the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,11 Dec 1888Yours of friday and saturday, (finished the evening of saturday) came to hand last evening—and your postcard of sunday reached me this morning. I am greatly rejoiced that you are doing so well—I look forward confidently now to seeing you in fair trim when I go East next month. You ought to have some copies of the big book by now and I shall hope to get one in a very few days. All is quiet here, no winter yet, roads slush, grass almost green, thin snow lying in patches, \"a gray discouraged sky over-head.\" Wm Gurd not back here yet & no further word from him—he may be here this evening.I am reading Parkman's histories—they are most fascinating books—have read \"La Salle and Discovery of the Mississippi\" and am reading \"France and Spain in the New World.\" Have struck nothing more interesting for a long time—I am borrowing them from R.S. Gurd who has become quite a book man these late years. Hope to be able to tell you tomorrow something about Wm Gurd and the meter.Love to youR M BuckeSee notes 12/26/88 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 11 December 1888"
