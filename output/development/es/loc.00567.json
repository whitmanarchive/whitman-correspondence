    "text": "New YorkMarch 21stYour letter in answer to my note came to hand this a.m. I was glad to hear from you, Walt, and hope you will continue to write often while you stay in Boston. It will be a good way for you to pass some leisure time as I do not doubt you will have plenty of it on your hands.Walt, I am glad, very glad, you have got things fairly squared. I do not care so much about the style the book comes out in. I want to see it out and have no doubt the style, writing, etc. will be no disgrace to Boston. You know I have always had a very high opinion of the people of the City of Nations.I have not seen any of the folks up town, but they will undoubtedly be very glad of your success.You are well of in Boston this weather, Walt. I cannot see across the streets. The dust is moving in a dense mass through the streets as dust in no other city but NY can move.—It is actually sickening.I want you to look closely at the Municipal affairs of Boston, and comparing them with those of New York, give me the conclusion you arrive at regarding their respective good and bad qualities.—If you want to form the acquaintance of any Boston Stage men, get on one of those stages running to Charlestown Bridge, or Chelsea Ferry, & enquire for Charley Hollis or Ed Morgan, mention my name, and introduce yourself as my friend.— I am obliged to you for your kind offer of sending me a few of the sheets in advance of Publication, and hope you will not forget it.—Bob and I had quite a long walk together in Central Park late Sunday. We talked much of you, and in anticipation had some long strolls together in the Park this summer. It is a noble place, and Boston can no longer point exultingly to their common as the finest park in America.By the way, what do you think of the common?I must go out, good bye,Fred Fred Vaughan to Walt Whitman, 21 March 1860"
