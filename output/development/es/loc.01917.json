My delay is because of my intuition to canvas[canvass] my friends and secure additional subscribers and then remit to you in a body.I am connected with the Port-chester Journal which circulates between 6 & 7000 copies. I mean to write an article of a couple of columns regarding Yourself and your poems and shall close it by soliciting subscribers for Your edition. Will You do me the favor of sending me a biographical sketch (to be used in the article) of your self and a spare photograph the latter to be used in illustration. Finally in soliciting the subscriptions shall we request parties to communicate direct with You or shall the 2'c receive & forward them. I sincerely trust that Your health is improving & that you may yet enjoy its best reestablishmentYours Very TrulyF.Ferdinand Seeger Dr. Ferdinand Seeger to Walt Whitman, 15 April 1876"
