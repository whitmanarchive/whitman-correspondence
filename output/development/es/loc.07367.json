    "text": "150 Bowery, New York, Mar 24, 1887.Dear Uncle Walt:Over two weeks ago I determined to let Major Pond manage your lecture. He is \"up\" in that kind of business and knows just how to do it. He said I might calculate three hundred and fifty dollars as the costâ€”the output, and he would guarantee to fill a hall. I at once assumed the responsibility and became security for the three hundred and fifty dollars. He then tried to get Chickering Hall but it was engaged for April 14th and also for every afternoon and evening about that date. We have at last settled upon the Madison Square Theatre for the afternoon (four o'clock) of April 14th. I must pay the seventy five dollars for the Theatre the moment it is engaged, and I will do so the moment I receive a telegram from you to-morrow saying, \"all right, go ahead.\" Please wire me at once on receipt of this.Alma is here with me and is well and says: \"Lots of love and thanks for the nice letter received at Equinunk.\"Ever yours sincerelyJ. H. Johnston. John H. Johnston to Walt Whitman, 24 March 1887"
