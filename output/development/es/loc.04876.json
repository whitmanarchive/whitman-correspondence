If he is at any place near, will you send the boy to him with his note please. I am sorry to trouble you, but shall be very greatly obliged.I hope this cold weather is treating you more kindly than the last.Very CordiallySophia Wells Royce WilliamsFebruary 16, 1888â€” Sophia Williams to Walt Whitman, 16 February 1888"
