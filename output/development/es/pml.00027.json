    "text": "Providence, R. I.October 21, 1868Dear Abby,I shall return to New York to-morrow, Thursday—leaving here at ½ past 12, noon, and getting in N. Y. about 8—& intend to go on to Washington on Monday next, 26th. I have been at the Channings's—Jeannie is quite unwell—but bears it like the heroine she is—William O'Connor is there—I am now at Mr. & Mrs. Davis's—Am treated with the greatest hospitality & courtesy every where. Yesterday Mr. Davis took me out riding—went down to Fields' Point, off the bay—& thence to the domain & factories of the Spragues, & so to Olneysville &c &c—as interesting a ride & exploration as I ever had in my life—I have seen Mrs. Whitman—& like her. We had yesterday here to dinner & spend the evening Nora Perry, Wm O'Connor, Dr. Channing, &c—To-day Mrs. Davis had intended to take me out riding, but it is threatening rain, wind east, & skies dark—So it will have to be given up. I like Mr. Davis much. I am very glad I made this jaunt & visit—Love to you, Helen, Emily, & all. Walt. Walt Whitman to Abby H. Price, 21 October 1868"
