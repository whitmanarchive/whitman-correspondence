    "text": "431 Stevens St &cMy dear friend,Enclosed I send you a piece printed here to give a true statement of the situation—& which I should be well satisfied to have printed in Britain. I ought to have written you before. I have read your \"ShakspereShakespeare\" & ought to have thanked you for it. I find it full of vitality & suggestiveness, on themes that might be supposed exhausted years ago—but are not at all exhausted. As I write I am feeling pretty comfortable—much the same as for last two years—no worse. John Burroughs was here with me last week. He is well. … M D Conway has called upon us. He is a good & intellectual man, but I don't think I either got hold of him, nor he of me, at all. My friend, I must still put off for another letter some things I have had in my mind for months to say to you. Your letters past—what John Burroughs told me—(and your ShakspereShakespeare book)—have grafted you more on my good will & memory than you perhaps know. I write in haste. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Edward Dowden, [January 1876]"
