M. but no Trans[cript] with notice yet—(will doubtless come to-morrow)—No further word from O'C[onnor]. I wait with anxiety—I told you ab't my dear friend John Burroughs being here—he is now back at West Park—I hear from Dr B[ucke] very often—welcome letters—have been reading Ellis's \"Early English Metrical Romances\" (Bohn's Ed'n)—Miss Pardoe's Louis XIV, and several Carlyle books including Mrs. C's Letters—Symonds's \"Greek Poets\" &c—upon the whole, get along & baffle lonesomeness, inertia & the blues.
