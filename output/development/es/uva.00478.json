    "text": "328 Mickle StreetCamden New JerseyApril 27 '85My dear Dr KnortzWhat is now the status of the Rolleston translation, with reference to publication? I have seen your letter of some weeks since to Dr Bucke—tell me of any thing new—or probabilities. I particularly hope it is intended to give the English text of the pieces, either on the left-hand page or running in smaller type at the bottom of every page & forming one third—If you have some loose sheets (last proofs, or what not) of your new \"Representative German Poems,\" send me three or four pages. (I dont want the book, but just want to see how it is made up, paged & printed)—My health is about as usual, except a worse lameness—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Karl Knortz, 27 April 1885"
