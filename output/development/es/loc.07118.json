    "text": "InsaneAsylum LondonOntario12 Oct '90Your card of 9th to hand yesterday. Long letter from Horace. Seems to be same excitement down your way about some man named Walt Whitman and another man named Ingersoll. What is it all about anyhow? Sorry to hear that grip and bladder troubles still stick to you—they seem to have come to stay—worse luck. It is good news however that you have sent off the\"Old Poets\" piece to N.A. Review—I look forwards with most pleasant anticipations to seeing it—I think if any thing your prose gets better lately—though the best piece you (or almost one one) ever wrote was the '55 preface.Yes \"Liberty and Literature\" is good—no title could be better, and won't Ingersoll make a splendid address on such a subject? I guess it will be the biggest thing yet.I hope to see you a week tomorrow at the latest—i.e. Monday 20th—I think if I was sick a bed and no money I would find a way to attend this circus. Keep writing meanwhile untill[until] say Thursday evening (and tell Horace same) I want to be kept posted.My annual Report is most done hope to finish it tomorrow—All well here!Love to youRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 12 October 1890"
