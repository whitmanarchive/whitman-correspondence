Y.New York now, in their own apartments, & I believe expect to be for the winter—Call on them, & 'Sula call too, when down——Write me more fully about your proposed book of next spring—(it is in the gestation of a book—the melting of the fluid metal, before the casting—that it receives that something to make its idiosyncrasy, identity—its \"excuse for being\" if it is to have any—)I have written to Jenny Gilder & sent her a small budget of printed slips &c. (I would like best to be told about in strings of continuous anecdotes, incidents, mots, thumbnail personal sketches, characteristic & true—such for instance as are in the 2d edition of your old Wash'n Notes)—Yours of 17th Dec. rec'dreceived—Tennyson's & the criticism safely rec'dreceived back—I suppose you rec'dreceived the hat photo. you spoke of—(I sent it to you Oct 1st)—I mail'd you also a pair of buck gloves—& Smith a pair too—four days since—I shall send this to Delaware County, as you say you are going home for a few days—Write me if you get it all rightW WHappy New Year to you & all Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 23–25 December [1878]"
