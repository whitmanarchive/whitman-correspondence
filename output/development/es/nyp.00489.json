    "text": "CamdenApril 14My dear friendI wish you would apply to the Librarian of Congress's office for the copyright at once—take it out of course in your own name—send the enclosed printed title page—& ask for a certificate—it is $1—(50¢ for entry & 50 for cert[ificate].)Every thing is going on well—but slowly with the book. It will be out last of the month. I shall send you an earliest copy or two. The publisher McKay told me to say to you that you can have at half price ($1) whatever number of copies you want \"for personal or literary use\"—Dr Bucke is absent from London on official business—(though I believe it is about time for him to return)—At last accounts John Burroughs was home in Delaware county, recuperating in the maple sugar woods—he was better—Do you see in the Heywood trial, the Judge peremptorily ruled out the L of GLeaves of Grass slips part of the indictment—(which ruling out \"was received with applause\") & H was afterwards on the remaining part or parts acquitted. So A[nthony] C[omstock] retires with his tail intensely curved inwards. I am just starting for two or three days down in my Jersey woods retreat.W WThe Doctor took a decided dislike to having the Latin motto on title page—so at his request I left it out—(I partly coincided with him)— Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 14 April [1883]"
