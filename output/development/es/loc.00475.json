    "text": "St. Louis,July 22nd 1877Dear Walt—I could not answer you before this as I have just returned from a trip down in South East Missouri.On 1st of July the Bd of Water Com. abolished my office and consequently it left me out in the cold—it was a political move and done to get me out of the way on the question of re-appointment—and I am sorry to say I fear it will be successful To-morrow I go to Little Rock Ark—to look into the water works question there—shall be gone a few days, and if I succeed shall have the job of making plans &c for that place—this will take me a month or so—Mrs Archer, the lady of the school where the children are has written me saying that she thinks it would be much best for them to remain with her during the vacation on account of the question of health.  I have just written her that I would like to have them visit you at Camden and spend also a shotshort visit with Mrs Gilchrist. When I returned here I found your letter and postal telling about Lou. I am sincerely glad that she is getting well again  It is sad to think of how she must have suffered  My love to her and to George also. I hope ere this she has recovered her health again.Everything in this section is very quiet  I have just made an arrangement about the right to operate some lead mines which if I can carry through will return a fortune to the party investing and will also be an excellent thing for me. I may likely come East this fall or latter part of the summer to see about getting the money to start the work. It is a most favorable thing and it seems to me I ought to have no difficulty in putting the matter into working shape  I would like to have you drop me a line as to how Lou and all of you are—AffectionatelyJeff Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 22 July 1877"
