    "text": "My Dear Friend:I get a few good letters on my little essay on the poets. Burroughs thinks the old poetical forms all sound & good & likely to last. So does Stedman. he says he is \"a universalist in art.\"—which I do not like. We are not to be universalists in painting & sculpture are we (I guess not) & revive the idiotic sculptures of India, Aegypt & Palenque, or the old wood paintings of the Pre-Giottesque painters? Things grow obsolete—worn out. Yet Stedman welcomes heartily, he says, the idea of a new & grander style in poetry. But I'm sure I don't know why I dwell on him: A lady had his volume here in the house yesterday, & I re-read part of what he says on you. It seems to me not only insulting but terribly small & boomerangish in its tendency, self-condemning, utterly inadequate, not touching the real heart of the matter at all—a dwarf walking round a giant, a pigmy measuring a god. Knortz sent 2 of the pamphlets to Germany. Bucke took 10. I have been advertizingadvertising it—(ever since it was out—) in Critic & Index, & one is to appear in the Lit. World.I hope you are not feeling badly this rather unhealthy weather. I receive & read with gratitude all the clippings you send me. Am hard at work on a Ruskin anthology for Pirate Alden, & feel rather knavish over the job. Aff.AffectionatelyW. S. Kennedy William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, [2 January 1886]"
