    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,13 April 1889Your p.c. of 11 just to hand. It is too bad that you should be so plagued with that confounded cold. As for the constipation you must not allow that to continue, it must be overcome at any price. If you are not better when you get this have in some doctor and take some measures. I would gladly advise you but think it would be much better to be guided by some one who cd see you. Am well pleased to see that the \"70th year Ed.\" of L. of G. is being kept in hand. This complete pocket Ed. I think will be one of the best stakes yet. It ought to be actually pubd on your birth day—that would be in time for all the summer outings of the year. I have had a long cheery letter from Willy Gurd. He is hard at work at Danbury on the gas meter. He expects that we shall soon be \"reaping a harvest from an unlimited field.\" I hope the grain will turn out good quality! All well here, weather very pleasant—we have had a good rain, it is now bright again & warm enough, guess we shall have an early springR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 13 April 1889"
