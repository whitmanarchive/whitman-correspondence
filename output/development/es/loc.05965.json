    "text": "WoodsideApril 6 1877Dear FriendYour paper was received yesterday and was very much pleased with the Contents and also with your kindness in sending it. I saw in the paper the death of Mrs Johnson. I was very much surprised to see it and felt very sad about it although a stranger to me I never met one so lady like and pleasing as she was and made the remark several times what an entertaining hostess she was I thought she must have made your visit very pleasant for you while there. I am glad that your health is better than it has been. Our little Walter has been very sick since I saw you we were afraid we would lose him but is just well now all the rest are well, send there[their] love to you hoping to see you soon. I remain yoursSarahPS Ma desires me to say do not forget us Woodsiders this summer. Sarah E. [Bownes?] to Walt Whitman, 6 April 1877"
