    "text": "Belmont Hilloverlooking the sea on thisbright warm dayDec 25, '88Dear Friend:—Merry XmasChristmas yrselfyourself! You are prolific in surprises these days! The Complete Whitman is a great surprise. It dwarfs everything else. That wonderful title page I look at & look at, & can't seem to get dovetailed into my mind. —it is so original—unique, & full of speaking life.I had a good time yesterday (an exciting warm dash here & there) in Boston while getting the books to their respective destinations. Please don't mention the express ch'gcharge. it was only—trifle & I want you to let me pay it please. You will have heavy postage on so many others of yr 150. Have the other 450 McKay's imprint? I left Baxter's on his office table, & he got it shortly, although I did not succeed in seeing him. Garland's I left with Baxter, having previously verified him (Garland) to be on the lookout. (He had a col.column & ½ piece in Herald on single tax (Hen. Georgeism) yesterday. Sanborn, since his loss of the state inspectorship of Charities office, has a table & chair at 141 Franklin St. (Geo.George H. Ellis's printing & pub. house). I left his book on his table in charge of good hands. I afterwards took a long walk down to 191 Commonwealth Ave, but found that Mrs Fairchild cdcould see no one, owing to one of her children having the measles—a catching disease or ailment. I was disappointed as I wanted to chat with her abtabout her visit to England.Mrs K's pleasant proof-room is at Geo.George H. Ellis's; & as I happened down there to see Sanborn at 12 o'c.o'clock we, (wifey & I), went out together & got a good dinner on Atlantic Ave. where we cdcould glimpse the sparkling sea, & see the foreign masts right at hand across the street.My day had a sad ending. A man right by me in a crowd at Fitchburg R.R. station tried to jump aboard train—partially intoxicated I tho'tthought—fell under the wheels, had his foot cut off, & otherwise, probably fatally injured. It was the first bad accident I had ever witnessed (strange to say), & it made me sick, haunted me all the evening & night. I tho'tthought of you & your hospital work, & realized for the first time the awful strain it must have been on you nurses & visitors. Such is the web of our life—joy & sorrow in rhythmic alternation.Please give my very special congratulations to Traubel anent this big volume (for I suppose he helped some). And give my regards to your Canadian nurse-friend. Wife sends love & remembrances.affec.affectionatelyW. S. Kennedy(write again soon if you can.) William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 25 December 1888"
