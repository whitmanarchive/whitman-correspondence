    "text": "London, Ont.,2 Sept 1890I have yours of 28th and 29th it came yesterday but was too much occupied to write. I got the paper you sent with the O.W. Holmes, \"Atlantic Monthly\" piece, but the paper did not have all there was abt you in the article. you should get the \"A.M.\" itself.O.W. is to all intents and purposes an Englishman (and a very good specimen too) Such a book as L.of G. and the mentality that goes with such a book is as far as possible from his ideal. The haughty, arrogant, masterful spirit of the poem evidently repells[repels] him, while the insouciant freedom of L. of G. (perhaps the greatest charm of all) has no attraction forhim—I guess he likes books just as well as nature and would rather be in the house than outdoors.The Rejoinder slip came in your last—I have read it again—of course you have said it all before (and more than once) but the children have not learned the lesson yet and there is no harm (even need) to repeat.Beautiful Autumn weather here—warm or cool days and cool to cold nights, good for sleeping!The meter jogs on slowly. no one could imagine, unless they were mixed up in and had to do with it, the work there is in starting a new industry such as this—I fancy now that we shall do very little this year except get going—but after we get going I fancy we shall go livelyLove to you as alwaysRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 2 September 1890"
