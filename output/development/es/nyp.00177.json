    "text": "My Dear Friend,I have been thinking about writing you at Brooklyn but as I did not know for certain that you were there I have waited until now so that I might be shure[sure] this would find you in Washington I presume you are there by this time and I hope soon to receive a communication from you. I have thought of you very often since I saw you and would have gone to Brooklyn to see you again had my health been good enough. I have not been out much since I saw you as the weather would not admit and when the weather is stormy my wound pains me so much that I am obliged to remain quiet: I received a letter from James a few days ago acknowledgeing[acknowledging] the receipt of your card. I also sent him your letter which he says he was very much pleased with: and he says he will always keep the card in remembrance of one who was so kind to me when I was so much in kneed of a little care When I wrote him before I did not tell him the picture was for him but merely enclosed your letter with the card in it telling him to return the letter after he had read it. And in answering he says The accompanying picture I understand is for me for which you will please give Mr Whitman my warmest thanks also for his kind rememberance[remembrance] of me I hope he may live to see you for I believe he has a great desire to as he speaks of you in every letterâ€”I presume you have seen some of my Washington friends ere this, and I hope to hear from them when I hear from you. If you see Miss Howard please remember me to her as you know I have good reason to thank her for many a kind turn which she wrought for me during my stay in that city. I cannot forget Armory Square hospital and I have a strong desire to visit that place again. Please tell Mr Woods (if you see him) I am enjoying good health and I send my kind regards to him and all others that I am acquainted with who may be in Ward A.Hoping to hear from you soon I will subscribe myself yours affectionately Jesse Mullery to Walt Whitman, 23 January 1865"
