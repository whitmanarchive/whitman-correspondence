Mother got a letter from you stating that you would not be down tomorrow. We ar[are] all most[almost] rosted[roasted] in this place, the sun is so warm and yet we cannot have the window up for if we do the wind blows all of our papers out doors. Walt there is a couple of letters down at our house for you one from England and one from New York, the one from N.Y.New York is from a bank I forget the name of the bank it is on the outside of the envelope. I wish that I coul[could] get a situation in a good printing office. Try the Democrat of Camden for me, will you?I should like to see you but I suppose I cannot until you come down as the the paper is running out I will have to stop.Ever your loving,Harry Staffordwrite soon and come down Harry Stafford to Walt Whitman, 9 July 1877"
