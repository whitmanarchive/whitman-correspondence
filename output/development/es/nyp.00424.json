    "text": "Esopus, N.Y.,Feb.February 3d, 1878.Dear Walt:Gilder suggests that a benefit be got up for you in N.Y., and that you be asked to lecture on Lincoln. He thinks it would go with a rush under proper management, and that lots of money might be made. The suggestion to me seems timely and just the thing, and we will set the ball agoing if you are willing, and have, or can have, the lecture ready. I saw Stedman when I passed through N.Y. and liked him. I think he would take hold and give the project a lift. Of course Swinton and many others would too. I think in fact we might have a big time and make it pay. Write me how you feel about it and if you favor it, how soon you could be on hand.As everJohn Burroughs. John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 3 February 1878"
