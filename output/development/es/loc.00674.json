I am almost sure.—because the Reg'tRegiment was not mentioned,—I shall wait anxiously untill[until] I can hear, I feel quite sure this morning, it was no one belonging to me. You must forgive me for troubleing[troubling] you when I know you at home all feel just as anxious I feel for you, but I think perhaps you have heard good news by this time, perhaps I am anxious needlessly I have no doubt I am,—perhaps brother George has written to Mother by this time, and you will almost vexed at me for feeling so, but I am alone, have been some sick, but I am not so weak, as you think, I can bear a good deal I shall be hopeful and cheerful, I feel George is safe, I expect dear brother you will think me easily agitated or frightened do not let me trouble you.
