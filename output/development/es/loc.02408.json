    "text": "It was a great shock to J. N. Johnson to have several men tell me when I last went to town that they were more or less sure they had seen in some newspaper notices of the death of Walt Whitman. I did not think, tho'though, I should have failed to see it in those I had been reading. It is (as it has been) the immeasurable thoughtfulness of us two men that should make it the saddest of happenings if we two are never to meet. Obstacles, obstacles tho'though, are always getting in the way. It seems to me if I could see you shortly by going to your brother's at St Louis, Mo., I would like to go there. I could serve an important business end by a little travel I thinkâ€”in some direction.Our P.O. has no envelopes.Mid AlaFeb 2 1886 John Newton Johnson to Walt Whitman, 2 February 1886"
