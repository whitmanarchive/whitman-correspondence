I was so much obliged to you for your good letter about my sister & all, & your kind invitation to my neices[nieces] which I have sent on to them. This morning is cloudy & a little chilly—Love to you, dearest friend, & to Bee & Giddy—We will all see each other soon—W. W. Walt Whitman to Anne Gilchrist, 11 June [1877]"
