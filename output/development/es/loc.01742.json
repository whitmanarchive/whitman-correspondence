    "text": "Thursday evening, June 26. Dear Pete,I rec'd your note to–day. I send you a note I have written to Mr. Edmunds—first take it to Mr. Noyes, (to whom it is enveloped,) and get an additional line I have requested from him—& then, if you conclude to try for the Carrier's place, go up & take it yourself to Mr. Edmunds. I must tell you another thing. I have written (wrote yesterday) a short note to Mr. Dubarry, your Superintendent, asking him if you couldn't be better placed, when the changes of the Baltimore connection are made. It may not amount to any thing, but I took a notion to write it. Pete, I am not having a very good time—My head troubles me—yesterday was as bad as ever—as far from well as ever—to–day I am a little easier, & have been out a few steps. But I keep up a good heart, dear son—& you must too. Walt.If you conclude not to try for the Carrier's berth, let the letters go. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 26 June [1873]"
