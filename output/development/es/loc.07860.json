    "text": "Insane AsylumLondon OntarioLondon19 Dec 1890Your welcome card of 16th came to hand yesterday. My brother Eustace (Duke) was back again for the day and left for home (Ottawa) at 5.30 last evening.Splendid sleighing here and I thoroughly enjoy it—get out for a good drive every day—sometimes twice.This morning the air is cold but the sun shining like a lovely June morning, have just been to North Building with Dr. Beemer all going well and quietly at asylum.In the city the meter affairs go on as usual \"slow but sure\" I think we shall be turning out meters within a month from now, have begun making but are not in a position yet to make all the parts n[eeded to] turn out meters. Xmas holidays now us a little delay but not much.RM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 19 December 1890"
