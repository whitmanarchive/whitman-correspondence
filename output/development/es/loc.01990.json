    "text": "SyracuseApril 21st 1867Dear FriendWalt Whitman,I was very much pleased a few days ago to receive your prompt answer of April 12th to my letter & I will try and be as prompt in return.Father has gone to church this morning as usual with him Sundays and I am left alone to write without interruption.I recdreceived a letter from my wife about the middle of last week she had arrived safely and was enjoying herself very well. I do not want you to misunderstand my motives in writing to you of my Situation & feelings as I did in my last letter or else I shall have to be mor[more] guarded in my letters to you. I wrote so because you wanted me to write how I was situated and give you my mind without reserve, and all that I want is your advice and Love, and I do not consider it cold lecture or dry advice. I wish you to write to me just as you feel & express yourself and advise as freely as you wish and will be satisfied.I am inclined to take things about as they come and consider all things for the best although we may not see it sometimesI have long since learned that contentment is the only real hapiness[happiness].I would like it very much if we could be together if only for a few days so that we might understand each other better and perhaps we can some of thes[these] days when we are a little differently situated.I must close this for the present as I have several other letters to write today.With Love I remainyour Boy FriendB. H. Wilson. Benton H. Wilson to Walt Whitman, 21 April 1867"
