    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylum for the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,8 Nov 1888Nothing further from Wm Gurd. So cannot yet fix date of departure. Very dark rainy weather here. All quiet. I cut this piece out of the London Advertiser this morning.Walt Whitman, according to the Star of London, has an English cousin, a Miss Whitman, who lives at Putney. She is a handsome girl with large dark eyes, very definite eyebrows, and is about six feet high. She \"does a little journalism\" and writes a weekly letter for one of the leading New Zealand papers.Have you ever heard of the said Miss W.? I fancy not. Your card of 5th came to hand yesterday and I was glad to see that you seemed satisfied with Wilkins appearance. Mighty glad also to find that you hold your grip so wellâ€”with your physique you ought to have been a hearty man at 90R M BuckeSee notes Nov 10, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 8 November 1888"
