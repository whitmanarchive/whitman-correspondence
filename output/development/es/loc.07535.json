B.\" and has considerable to say of my \"fame\"—(I am not sure but we are to put E C S on our list of real permanent friends & understanders)—I suppose you have got (or will soon get) the Springfield Republican short notice of Nov: B—I rec'd a note from Hamlin Garland, Jamaica Plain, Mass. asking me to send Nov. B. to W D Howells, wh' I did.I am sitting in my big chair by the oak wood fire as I write—it is a darkish, damp, heavy-air'd day & I am not feeling my easiest—Mr Ingram has just been in & bo't a copy of Nov: B. for a Quakeress friend, & got some loose reading matter for a prisoner in jail I send to sometimes—my head is weighty & sore to-day—Dave McKay is behaving very well—he takes the whole ed'n, & pays me $313.50 on Jan 10 '89—& pays the binder—I retain 100 (printed 1100)—Did I tell you I rec'd a strong affectionate literary & personal letter from Kennedy—I repeat that last photo of you in hat &c. is one of the very best could be made—there is nothing better made here or in N Y—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 26 October 1888"
