    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington. Jan. 8, 1867Dearest mother,Well, every thing is just about the same. I rec'd your letter New Years. I have rec'd a small present from Heyde—he sent me a small stereoscope, that is to put pictures in, & look through it, & it magnifies them, & makes them look like the real thing—it has some beautiful views of scenes in Vermont—I forget whether I told you that I sent Han some gloves & a $5 bill, Christmas—so I suppose this is in return—He says Han rec'd the parcels. Mrs. Grayson is still living—she is slightly better—I go [to] the hospital now oftener than usual—there are several very low—I just go, for an hour or so, [a] time—I had rather go than not—Every thing is covered with snow here, looks wintry enough—cold weather, but somehow I like it—I have no fire in my room, so far, this winter—I have rec'd a letter from Mrs. Price. You must tell me how George is getting along with his business. You might ask George whether any thing could be done with $500 cash about getting a lot & moderate-sized two story house to have say 15 or $1600 on mortagage?—whether they could get some one to take the rest on mortgage, so as to save themselves—Mat, I went to the opera last [night]—went alone—I was much pleased —the piece was Ernani—first amusement I have been to in a year, except once to hear Ristori —Good by, mother dear.Walt.I sent Jeff some envelopes for you a week ago. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 8 January [1867]"
