    "text": "Camdenearly P M Jan: 19 '89I suppose you got the Springfield Rep'n with Sanborn's criticism—the San Franc: Bulletin with notice—& Poet-lore, the new magazine—a fine sunny day here—somewhat cooler—much the same with me as of late, but I am getting fearfully staled with this long, long confinement—do not get any physical strength or improved ability—not a bit—The Critic (Jan: 19) comes—has a notice of Nov: Boughs, perhaps the most eulogistic & sweeping yet—I send it to you—I am alone—stir up the fire & put in some wood—as it grows colder—have my nice lunch of ice cream & a cup of milkSunday Jan: 20—Cloudy & looks & feels like snow—The good bound big Vol. is not made by the binder yet—& goes over to the ensuing week. I shall have one for you—(I make no great calculations on satisfaction)—Send you enclosed Edward Carpenter's last—no word from O'Connor. Horace rec'd a few words from John Burroughs—He is still at his place West Park on the Hudson—seems to be so-so in health &c. working &c—I dig away at Symond's Greek Poets—very instructive & competent—his dissertations on the great poets I dwell on and again—he takes a stand on the modern & then makes a world-criticism & dissection of them—very true & acceptable & convincing to me—Ed is off for a two hours or more excursion on foot—I sit here by the stove—very quiet to-day—Do you get Harper's Monthly? Look in Feb: number at Howells's Editor's Study—at a guess—God bless you all—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 19–20 January 1889"
