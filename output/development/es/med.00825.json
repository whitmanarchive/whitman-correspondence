    "text": "15 Quai de Bourbon.Paris,April 26, 1888.Sir and Dear Poet,In admiration of some of your poems, which I read in an edition, ridiculously \"expurgated,\" published by Chatto & Windus, in London, I feel constrained to have the Parisian people share the estimation in which I hold your high lyrical talent.Would it be too much to ask of you that you indicate the volume (the edition) which you would prefer having rendered in the French? My friend, Jules Laforgue (who died only too prematurely) has already given to the public two of your poems, and the reception they met with seems to presage a new victory for your works.In expectation of your kind reply, Sir and dear poet, permit me to assure you of my sympathy in art and of my profound admiration.Francis Viele-Griffin. Francis Viele-Griffin to Walt Whitman, 26 April 1888"
