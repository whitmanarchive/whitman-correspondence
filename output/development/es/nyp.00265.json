    "text": "Washington, September 7, 1867. W.C. & F.P. Church.Gentlemen:The check for $60. arrived safely this morning. Please consider this a receipt for said sum. I received, some ten days since, the six proof-impressions of the Carol—& am much obliged. (No copies of magazine.)I forward herewith another poem for the Galaxy. If acceptable, please, after correcting, let me have a good proof in time.The right of publishing Ethiopia Commenting, in future book, is reserved to me.The price of the piece is $25.I have, in composition, an article, (prose,) of some length—the subject opportune—I shall probably name it Democracy. It is partly provoked by, & in some respects a rejoinder to, Carlyle's Shooting Niagara. I think it might be specially appropriate to your purposes & scope. I would propose it to you for a leading article for January '68 Galaxy. Please write me how the idea suits you. Or, as I am coming to Brooklyn in a few days, perhaps I may as well call personally, & get your notions about it.Walt Whitman. Walt Whitman to William C. Church and Francis P. Church, 7 September 1867"
