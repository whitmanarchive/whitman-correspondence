    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,15 Aug 1888I received last evening the last pages of the book. I admire the Elias Hicks greatly and think I understand the drift of it. Do not think you have ever written any better prose. It is altogether an admirable & most valuable piece—I shall write more at length another day, am rather crowded this morning I think I shall remodel my piece (that I sent Walsh of Lippencott) and make it into a review of the new vol. perhaps in that shape I shall get some \"able Editor\" to print it—I have seen your little piece on Sheridan (one of them). You must be coming round finely to be able to write so vigorously. All well here. A little warmer today.RM Buckesee notes Aug 16 1888See notes Aug 16, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 15 August 1888"
