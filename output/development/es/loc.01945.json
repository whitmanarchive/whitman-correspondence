    "text": "119 Lower Baggot Street Dublin14 February 1876My dear Mr. Whitman,'Bram Stoker Feb, '76.I hope you will not consider this letter from an utter stranger a liberty. Indeed, I hardly feel a stranger to you, nor is this the first letter that I have written to you. My friend Edward Dowden has told me often that you like new acquaintances or I should rather say friends. And as an old friend I send you an inclosure[enclosure] which may interest you. Four years ago I wrote the enclosed draft of a letter which I intended to copy out and send to you—it has lain in my desk since then—when I had heard that you were addressed as Mr. Whitman. It speaks for itself and needs no comment. It is as truly what I wanted to say as that light is light. The four years which have elapsed have made me love your work four fold and I can truly say that I have ever spoken as your friend. You know what hostile criticism your work sometimes evokes here, and I wage a perpetual war with many friends on your behalf. But I am glad to say that I have been the means of making your work known to many who were scoffers at first. The years which have passed have not been uneventful to me, and I have felt and thought and suffered much in them, and I can truly say that from you I have had much pleasure and much consolation—and I do believe that your often earenst earnest speech has not been thrown away on me or that my life & thoughts fail to be marked with its impress—I write this openly because I feel that with you one must be open. We have just had tonight a hot debate on your genius at the Fortnightly Club in which I had the privilege of putting forward my views—I think with success. Do not think me \"cheeky\" for writing this. I only hope we may sometime meet & I shall be able perhaps to say what I cannot write. Dowden promised to get me a copy of your new edition, and I hope that for any other work which you may have you will let me always be an early subscriber. I am sorry you are not strong. Many of us are hoping to see you in Ireland.We had arranged to have a meeting for you. I do not know if you like getting letters. If you do I shall only be too happy to send you news of how thought goes among the men I know—With truest wishes for your health and happiness believe meYour friendBram Stoker Abraham \"Bram\" Stoker to Walt Whitman, 14 February 1876"
