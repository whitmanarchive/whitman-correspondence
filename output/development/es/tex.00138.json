I suppose you have herd that general buford[Buford] was dead he was one good general as there was in the field he commanded our division and every one liked him. how is war matters in washington[Washington] now any signs of it ever closing I guess this next draft will be apt to bring in few more men in the army.Well Dear uncle there aint[ain't] much news here at presant[present] we are in very good quarters here, but how long we will stay I dont[don't] know. Well I will close by wishing you a mery[merry] mery[merry] Christmas and a happy New Years.Please excuse poor writing and accept this from your well wishing Friend and comrad[comrade] Livingston J.
