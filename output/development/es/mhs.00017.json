    "text": "2316 Pine streetSt LouisOct 11—noonDear SisterI have been quite unwell, a bad spell with my head, worse than usual, nine or ten days—I kept up, but had no comfort—the last two days it is easier, & it is passing over apparently, for the present——Lou I think I would like to have you or George put up my letters (not the books or papers) in a package, & send them to me here, 2316 Pine street,—if it dont[don't] make too big a package, send by mail, (postage will be 6 cts an ounce by mail)—(or if George thinks best, send by express—that is if the parcel is too big)—please do it soon as convenient—there is brown wrapping-paper & string in my room—I shall stay here perhaps two weeks longer—It is very hot here for this season, indeed as hot as we had it in July there in Camden—I go out most every day, Jeff has taken me out riding very often, & I have been everywhere within several miles, & in all the outer parts of the City which are the roomiest & the pleasantest by far of any city I have ever seen—Jeff is very kind indeed, & I am agreeably fixed here—& since I am here so far, & shall probably never come again, I have concluded to stay awhile—The girls are well & hearty & send their love—Hatty is down stairs piano-practising as I write—I have not written any thing for publication yet here, as I have not felt well, but I want to, before I leave, as this trip is a great revelation, especially the Colorado journey, & the mountains——Lou your letter was rec'dreceived, & very glad to get it—Write again soon after receiving this—I have written to Hannah and Mary from here—I have just written to the Camden post office to send my letters on here for the present—Lou this is a wonderful, wonderful country, & the richest city upon the whole (thousands and thousands of fine comfortable 5 or $6000 well built brick or stone houses, with gardens around them) & streets ahead of Chestnut st & more crowded, &c &c—but there are just two things here you & I w'dwould never get used to, & would spoil all,—that is the air you breathe is always tainted with coal smoke & pungent gas—& a perpetual dust & smut & little black motes, that forever smut your clothes & hands & face, all the time, night & day—So you see there are always some bad points, even to the greatest & best—But the folks here don't seem to mind it, or think it is any thing—So good bye for the present Lou dear & love to all—Walt Walt Whitman to Louisa Orr Whitman, 11 October [1879]"
