    "text": "Department of JusticeWashington. 187Monday noon—Jan. 1, 1872. Well, mother dear, New Year has begun—it is the funniest one yet—there is a fog as dark as Egypt here, sometimes you cant see a rod before you—it has been so for two days steady—very muddy, & spells of drizzling rain—I am well & hearty—I am just informed that I am to be transferred over to the Treasury Building, into the Solicitor of the Treasury's office (it is in the Department of Justice—is a branch of it)—Mr. Williams, the new boss, wishes to bring some friend of his here—I do not know that I shall dislike the change—I can tell better all about it in a week or two—I have applied for a good long leave of absence, to commence about Feb. 1st—I shall probably get it, but without pay, (or with only a small part pay)—I am willing to take a leave without pay—I want to come home for a while, both to be home, & to see about the new edition of my books—I am real well & fat & hearty this winter—but I believe I have got a little set against one thing & another here, (especially the grub,) & I want a change for a couple of months very much—Mama dear, I want to hear about your last week—& George & Lou—I sent three letters to you last week, & papers—I knew that policeman Doyle that was shot dead here—he was Peter Doyle's brother—I was at the funeral yesterday—it was in the papers I sent you—love to you, dear mama—Walt.I forgot to say Arthur Price is here, on the iron-clad Mahopac—the vessel is at the navy-yard—expects to sail soon—I am going down this afternoon to go on board the ship & see him—he is well & hearty. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 1 January 1872"
