    "text": "New YorkFeb. 12, 1875Dear W.Yours at hand. Enclosed I hand a full statement of our affairs, made up with a good deal of care, and I believe, entirely correct. I see you put the number of copies of new Ed. of Leaves of Grass at 496 in your memo: It was only 494, ie. I only received and receipted for this number. You may have taken the other two from Leiner. I saw Dillingham, (by the bye, he was the Co. of Felt & Co. which firm has gone out of existence.) He declines to take the books—says sales will not warrant—there is no money in it I know, and these driving pushing fellows will not do anything with it on that account, while others, who are respectable in the eyes if the world, wouldn't have your books because of their estimate of their character. These two classes left out—It is only here and there a speckled sheep, like J.R. turns up who—not to put too fine a point upon it, don't care a d—ndamn for Mrs Grundy, who would take you in. What do you say to Doolady? You know Mike! He's a clever fellow and works off a good many books. If you want to go to Boston, I dare say Estes &Lauriant would take the books on the terms I took them. They are a new concern. I dont know any thing of them except what I see in the papers. One of them was with Piper & Co.. The balance due you 63.43 will have to go in with general indebtedness. I think my estate will pay 50 cents on the dollar: hope so at any rate. I wish it was better. It has been a very poor affair for me. I havn't had four James Redfield to Walt Whitman, 12 February 1875"
