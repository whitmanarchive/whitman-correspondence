    "text": "328 Mickle St CamdenWednesday night May 28[1884]Dear HarryI recdreceived your letter over two weeks ago—Am glad you have a good place at Marlton—such a spot is so much pleasanter than Phila.Philadelphia or Camden or any close city—Hank I am sorry you have that trouble with your throat but I have no doubt it will go over in time—your mother was up here yesterday—bro'tbrought me a nice chicken—said every thing was all right with your folks home—I am pretty much as usual again after quite a long siege—I am here in a little old house I have bought—my room is a big one in the 2d story—get along well enough (nothing to brag of)—there is a couple of elderly folks, acquaintances of mine, Mr and Mrs Lay, they live in the house, & I take my meals with them. Any how I like it all ever so much better than the Stevens Street business—Am not doing any thing lately, & the sale of my books has been very slim for some time—Met a lady on the ferry last week, she came up to very pleasant & said, \"Your friend Jo Allen is in Laredo, Texas, keeping store doing well, & has a family\"——So long, Harry dear boy—write soon, & I will the same—I send you some papers—W W Walt Whitman to Harry Stafford, 28 May [1884]"
