My vacation is nearly done, & in four or five days more I shall be back in Washington. I have been here in Providence the past week, as guest of Thomas Davis, a manufacturer here, & formerly M. C.—have had a good time generally, in a quiet way—am going on to New York this afternoon, & shall be back in Washington on the 27th—William O'Connor is here in Providence—I have been with him a good deal—he is not very well, but goes around—Will finish my letter in New York, & mail it thence to-morrow. Walt. Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 22 October 1868"
