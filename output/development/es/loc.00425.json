    "text": "BrooklynOct. 8th/63My dear WaltI yesterday wrote you enclosing the $10 from Mr Kirkwood for the use of the \"sogers\"  The enclosed $8 is contributed thus $5by Moses Lane $2\"  J. D. Martin \"1\"  Henry Carlow In my yesterdays letter I said something about the acknowledgement of the moneys  I fear that I did not express myself so that you could understand me  I do not want to get the credit of sending money that I dont[don't] send,—I want to show your letters to those that contribute so that they may see that all the money they give me is duly sent and appropriated and as I proposed this regular contribution I dont[don't] like to have them know that I am the first one to back out, but as I said yesterday I think that whatever I possibly can do I ought to do for Andrew, that whatever I can give ought to be given to him. Andrew is in a bad fix, he is hardly able to get around and has no money  Mat sends him at least one good meal a day. He generally comes and spends an hour or two at the house. I had quite a talk with Dr Ruggles yesterday about him. The Dr says that had he gone to the interior when he first advised him to in the summer he would have stood a fair chance of getting well, but that now he thinks that it is more than wicked to take his money and make beleive[believe] to cure him for in his opinion that is almost impossible  I think that it is about so. It makes one feel rather bad when you think of it dont[don't] it  Ruggles says that his lungs are much diseased. I wish that you could come home for a short time and see Andrew  Mother and the rest are quite well. This morning mother is not quite so well,—a bad cold—yesterday Jess was sick all day—there is no doubt Walt in my mind but that Mother is doing injury both to herself and Jess by her economy  they do not have enough good things to eat, and they are both of the age that they require it. I have spoken of it till I have tired and it dont[don't] accomplish any-thing. I wish you was at home to give a little advice now and then.Walt I often think of you wonder what you are about and how you get along. Do you have any employment there. You must often meet Brooklyn people there  I understand that they liked your letter at the Times. Twas superior to the Brooklyn one I'm sure. Walt let me hear from you—a letter that I can show Lane &c  They like to read your letters  Mattie and the babies are well and send their love. Ruggles always tells me to remember him to you. Probasco complains that he has not heard from you since he sent you some money, fears that it did not reach you  I will write again soonThos J. Whitman Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 8 October 1863"
