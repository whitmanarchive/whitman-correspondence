    "text": "February 3. 87Pall Mall GazetteNorthumberland Street,Strand.Friend WhitmanMany thanks for your letter and the papers you sent, most of which we have quoted in the paper. I am sorry, however, to see in The Camden Courier you sent me, the following extract from an interview in The Philadelphia Press:I received a handsome New Year's present of Â£80 from Sir Edward Malet, British embassador at Berlin; Lord Ronald Gower and A. Gerstenberg, a wealthy Hebrew in the British army.The present you received, was not from these gentlemen, but from the readers of the Pall Mall Gazette, who were your friends, and Sir Edward Malet's and Mr. Gerstenberg's names were given to us, and by me to you, in strict confidence. In mentioning the New Year's gift again, please describe it as that of the paper and not of these individuals, whose initials only were given.With best wishes from us all, and with congratulations on the tardy pension, of which the Cable brings us word.I am,Yours always sincerelyHenry Norman.Henry Norman Henry Norman to Walt Whitman, 3 February 1887"
