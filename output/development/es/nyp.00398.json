I see by the papers you sent me that your health is not very good and I assure you that I am very sorry to hear it. I would like to know how you are situated whether there is any thing that I can do to contribute to your comfort and Happiness. If there is I will do it if it is in my power.My Wife is quite sick and has been for the past two weeks. The Children are all well as usual.With Love I remain As ever Yours, Benton H. Wilson to Walt Whitman, 23 June 1875"
