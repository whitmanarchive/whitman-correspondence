    "text": "ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington,Friday, June 29, 1866. Dearest Mother,I rec'd your letter this morning—I hope you have had as pleasant a change in the weather, as we have here—it rained yesterday & the night before—& to-day the weather is just right—cool enough—poor old Mrs. Mix is quite sick—Hector Tyndale has been to see me again—always talks about you—When in the army he had a very bad wound in the head—was a year getting over it—I think George must mind how he exposes himself to the sun, or gets overheated—I find I have to maneuvre through the very hot days, like a general in fight—I carry an umbrella, and if the sun gets to fall on me good & strong, any of the real hot days, my head gets swimming, & I have to stop in the street, or rather get inside some store or something, & sit down—I have had just that happen to me twenty times—so now I am very slow & careful—I think George might find a suit of good blue navy flannel first-rate for the hot weather—I am wearing mine—the suit I wore last summer—I never had any thing for heat that suited me so well—Jeff, I hope you had, (or will have,) a first rate time on your fishing excursion—I should like greatly to be with you—Well good bye for this time, dear mother—I send you some envelopes. Love to sister Mat, & the little girls. Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 29 June 1866"
