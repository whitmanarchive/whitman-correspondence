    "text": "13 May '86My dear WaltYour post card of 28 April was sent down to me here yesterday. I have had O'Connor's little book and read it. Have been in England now nearly two weeks and am having a pleasant time seeing all my old friends &c. I saw Mrs Costelloe a couple of times and took her last friday to the Grand Theatre, Islington, in London to see Shelley's Cenci acted. The play was put on the boards by the Shelley Society and acted \"privately\" not advertised, but the theatre (a very large one) was crowded. Vezin acted old cenci & Alma Murray Beatrice and these two part were about the best acting I have ever seen. When I return to London (early next week I think) I am to stay a few days with Mrs Costelloe and shall write you again from there. We had a long passage (16 days) I enjoyed the sea very much & was almost sorry to get to England, the voyage did me good too. I was over a week in London before I came down here and was pretty busy while there. After my visit to Mrs Costelloe I go to Scotland. The weather was good all across the ocean and very fine the week I was in London but since I have never been here it has been cloudy cold and wetâ€”but it does not much matterI am enjoying myself and getting a good rest which I needed after the bustle of London. Goodly, remember me to Mrs Davis, I expect you will be living in great style when I get back you are so rich now!Always yours friendR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 13 May 1886"
