    "text": "Paskek,Aug. 9/75My Dear FriendI received a Postal card from you yesterday. I wrote to you a long time ago, two letters, both have been unanswered untill now. I was afraid you might be very sick, and unable to write, and so became very anxious about you.I am glad however that it is not so. I was to New York a couple of weeks ago, and saw Uncle George. He is still in the Stand, working for J. & D.J. Ryer. He said he had also but without an answer. He told me he was afraid something was wrong with you so you see you are not forgotten. I often think of you, and how I would like to come and see you or have you to do the same to me.However if all goes well untill[until] July 4th,/76, I expect to come to Philadelphia, to celebrate the Centennial. when[When] you write, tell me all you know about the arrangements that have been made, &c, if it is fair weather, tomorrow, (which is very doubtful) our Sunday School, together with Six others is to have a rail road Exorcise to Haverstien, a town about 20 miles, north from here.We are all enjoying good health this Summer and I wish you could pick up again and come out and spend a few weeks with us, and Uncle John, who lives only about a mile off. I am very sure we would all be glad to see you come. Remember it is not amongst strangers but as it were your own folks. So take co in your next letter appoint a time when you will come, and then stick to it.You can ride with in a mile from the house with the cars, where we will meet you with a Horse and carriage, write to me soon.I am as ever,Your loving friendWalt.
