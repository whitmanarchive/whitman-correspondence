    "text": "London, Ont.,20 Aug 1890I wrote the date as above on 20th and have not had a moment since in which to write the letterIt is now 22 Aug.And in the first place I may say that I received by mail from England nearly a week ago J.A. Symonds' \"Essays: Speculative & Suggestive\", that I have, of course, found time to read \"Democratic Art\", and that I am greatly disappointed. It, to my mind, comes far short of what such a man ought to have written on such a subject. The singular thing to me is that he does not seem to understand the least what you are driving at, what you are there for. He speaks for instance of \"Walt Whitman whose whole life has beenemployed in attempting to lay foundations for a new national literature.\"Is it not extraordinary that he should not see through and behind this (perfectly true as far as it goes) phase of the matter?How strange too (to cite a small but significant point) that he does not know that the \"Poetry of the Future\" is included in \"Sp. Days & Collect\"?The whole article is \"flat, stale and unprofitable\"—a saw dust chewing business—dealing with the hull, the shell, the superfices, never for one time, one flash of insight penetrating to the heart of the business. Too bad, too bad.I have your note of 18th, Have not seen the \"Rejoinder\" you mention. Will you not send it? Or do you mean the reply to the Woodberry shirt sleeve lie? I have that & Kennedy's letter. I hope you will find Symonds' letter & send it, Am particularly anxious to read it now and compare it with his \"Democratic Art\" (it may be he has purposely kept to the outside, the form in \"DA\" All well here and going well—only too much workLove alwaysRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 20-22 August 1890"
