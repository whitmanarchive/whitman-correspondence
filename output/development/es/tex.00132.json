    "text": "Dear WalterAs I am not a going out to day I thought that my time could not be better imployed[employed] than by writing to you. So hear goes,—First I must tell you about the patients hear. I was up to Ward A, this morning to see No. 40, he is better than he was when you went away, and Harry, the Wardmaster, thinks that he will get well—Concerning the patients in Ward C, they are all getting better. — I was asking Miss Platt how your patients wer[were] in the ward and she told me that they wer[were] better—that man with the bad leg is mending his wound is quite painful yet but is getting along as well as you could expect. the man in the other wards are mending—thear[there] has bin no wounded brought in since you left—things in this ward have chainged[changed] some since you left. Miss Lowell has got back & is getting things put to rites, as she thinks, you know that she has bin on a visit to N.York. J. A. Tabor has gon[gone] to his Regt. he went on Monday—I guess it was rather unexpected to him. Cuningham[Cunningham] is about the saim[same] as he was when you left him. I cannot see any change. since Tabor has gon[gone] Billy Clements (that little fellow that was in this ward) has been dresser. he does verry[very] well—all of the rest of the patients in theis[these] Ward are mending—all things are a going on in the same old stile hear— I received a letter from T. P. Sawyer to day he is well. he sayes[says] that they have bin on the move so that he could not answer my letter before. his Regt is now near Bealtons Station, a building railroad. he did not mention any thing about your letter—he is a going to try to get a pass to come up hear this winter—Conserning[Concerning] my self I am about old fassion[fashion]. my leg mends slowly (about as it was when you wer[were] hear) I have bin[been] out in the city on Monday & Tuesday, both days I was at the relief associations, to try to get a shirt or two—yesterday I got a order from the Chaplain yesterday to get two shirts from the Christian Commission, when I went up and showed them the order they told me that they had non—than I went into their store room and thear[there] was some nice shirts thear[there]. I told them that they wer[were] just the kind that I wanted—but they told me that they were layed[laid] out for distributation[distribution] amongst the diferant[different] camps through the city. so I got non of them, & I was mad enough to, after walking up thear[there] three times and than get nothing, (the Relief association may be a verry[very] nice thing, but I cant see it, for I never get any thing from them yet—you have give me more than all of the rest put together. . so you are the relief association that I (as well as all the rest of the boys) like best. Lewis K. Brown to Walt Whitman, 5 November 1863"
