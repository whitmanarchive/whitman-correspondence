    "text": "Kirkwood, N.J.January 18, 1878 Walt:You know that I have written to you last, and I cannot tell how it is that you will not answer my letter, I did not mean to offend you, but if I did will you please foregive[forgive] me, I am here with friend Sharp, and a lonely time I am haveing[having] of it; I have not been away from here any time till Tuesday, since I was up to see you, then as father was so sick that he could not do anything I had to stay home and work for him; as he was going to kill hogs Wednesday; so I had to looselose three days right off; I was to Camden yesterday and would of stoped[stopped] to until I you know that I cannot enjoy myselfe[myself] any more at home, if I go up in my room I always come down feeling worse than I do when I go up, for the first thing I see is your picture, and when I come down in the sitting room there hangs the same, and whenever I do anything, or say anything the picture seems to me is always looking at me; so I find that I am better sattesfiedsatisfied when I am here than when I am home. When Herbret[Herbert] was down he said you was very well and happy. I talked to him and got out all I could, but that was not much. I have but found a girlfriend and that is to say, she is a good and true friend to me, we have had many good times togeathertogether, but none that hangs with me like those you and I have had. I received a letter from her last night, she said that she was well, and thought of coming over soon. I suppose you know that father has had another hemorrhage, but he is better now but he will never be able to do any more hard work. \"Ned Rogers\" is coming over to help him to day: the little Irish have got through with the deviding[dividing] of the place: they have each taken a part of it, and now it is settled. I hope that you will not keep this letter or tell anyone what it contains, I don't want our folkes[folks] to know that I have been so foolish as to write to you when you will not answer. There is one thing that I have foregottenforgotten, it is this Mont has been going to School at the Haddon institute for sometime he likes it fystrait[first rate]. I will have to close my letter, as the paper is running on so adieu if I never hear from you will think of you as an old friend that is dead and gongone.Good byeHarry Stafford Harry Stafford to Walt Whitman, 18 January 1878"
