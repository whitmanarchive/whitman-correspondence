    "text": "14 Eagle St. HaulghBolton21 May/89.Dear Walt Whitman,Your two Bolton friends and admirers, J. Johnston & J. W. Wallace, again write in sending you their love and best wishes on your Birthday.We are very thankful to have within our power the means of again communicating with you and of sending you a small token of our deep and continued reverence & affection.Since our last letter your November Boughs has appeared—of which we each immediately procured a copy. And not the least of the pleasures it gave us was the admirable portrait of yourself on the frontispiece. Every line of the book has been carefully read—most of it again & again—& has increased the heavy debt we owe you. We feel, too, in reading its closing lines that besides your other great services to humanity, you, too, like Elias Hicks, like George Fox, have \"laboured\", and \"made contributions\" to, and, \"best of all set an incarnated example\" of, life spent in the constant \"thought of God, merged in the thoughts of moral right and the immortality of identity.\"—But your contributions have been far greater, and of immeasurably wider scope than theirs, inasmuch as they go along with a vastly increased intellectual power and range, and are \"consistent with the Hegelian formulas, and consistent with modern science.\" By these immense services in these our times, and especially in your contributions to the \"thought of the immortality of identity,\" you have enrolled yourself for ever amongst those who, you justly say, are \"dearest to humanity,\"—and are inexpressibly dear to us.We hope that the remainder of your life may be serene and calm, and cheered by the ardent love and gratitude of those who, like us, are so deeply indebted to you.We each send you £5 which we should like you to expend in some visible token of our good will.We also enclose 2 photos. 1st—one of J. Johnston—taken for presentation to the members of an ambulance class, of which he was the teacher, and who gave him the writing cabinet shown on the table. 2nd J. W. Wallace in his own little room, photographed by J. Johnston some months ago. It isn't a good portrait, but it may James W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 21 May 1889"
