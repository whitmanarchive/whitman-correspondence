    "text": "56 Easton Sq. N. W.28 Feb.yFebruaryDear Whitman(If you will permit me to drop the \"Mr.\")—I write in some haste. Yours of 26 Jan.January & 11 Feb.February received.Ever since we in England heard that your health had received a serious shock, we have had it much at heart, I aſsure you, to testify our love, respect & gratitude, in some tangible shape: & I c.dcould at this moment tell you of at least 3 several plans wh.which were actively mooted, & partly started. Our ideas on the subject have shifted according to the varying accounts that reached us, more especially with regard to the material comforts of your present mode of life. As the extract wh.which you send me from the West Jersey Preſs, & wh.which you vouch for as leſs strong than the facts, proves that some more cheerful preceding accounts were not accurate, there are some of us who w.dwould really be glad to exert ourselves to the extent of our moderate means, to prove that we are not insensible of the obligations we owe you. Profr.Professor Dowden of Dublin, & myself, have more especially been in frequent written communication on this subject, &, if I hear from you in terms to warrant, my so doing, I shall call the attention of others to the subject.Meanwhile Mrs. Gilchrist & I agreed on the 25th that we w.dwould at once ask you to oblige each of us with copies of your forthcoming books to the value of £5 (25 dollars, I believe this is) each. This morning I saw about getting the requisite letter of credit for the amount, £10, & it will no doubt be procured & transmitted to you very shortly. I c.dcould not find any suitable locality nearer than New York mentioned in the Bank documents.—Mrs. G.Gilchrist w.dwould wish her books to be copies of the Two Rivulets only. I sh.dshould wish for The Two Rivulets, & also the forthcoming edition of your poems, in whatever proportions may be most convenient, & suitable for making up the £5.I sent the substance of the West Jersey Preſs article to the Academy, but regret to find the Editor not forward to publish it: if he fails, I will send it elsewhere. Will also lose no time in offering for publication the poem & prose-matter wh.which I read with great interest. I trust I may succeed in all these points.Arthur Clive (so Dowden informed me long ago) is really Standish O'Grady, an Irish barrister of good position (or good prospects, I forget which). As it happens, I have not yet seen his article.With loveYoursW. M. RossettiDowden has mentioned to me your \"Autograph Edition,\" but without defining what it is, nor do I precisely know. It sounds tempting, & I hope Mrs. Gilchrist & I may come in for some specimen of it.RosettiFeb. 28 '76AnsAnswered March 17 William Michael Rossetti to Walt Whitman, 28 February 1875"
