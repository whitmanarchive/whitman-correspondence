    "text": "MinchenCarroll, Iowa,June, 25th/84.Dear Walt Whitman, \"That my soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each other without ever seeing each other, and never perhaps to see each other, is every bit as wonderful\" and that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful, and that I can remind you, and you think them and know them to be true is just as wonderful.\" Indeed there is very little in Leaves of Grass but what I know to be true. It is some more than two years since I first read your book, and sometimes I have felt so in raport[rapport] with your feelings therein expressed that I have written you dozzens[dozens] of letters, and I have no doubt you would have got them, had they been done on paper, or any material transmittible.[transmittable] I presume I have read \"The Open Road\" twenty times or more. Last fall I was staying over two months—with Mrs Dr. Severance of Milwaukee. I read it to her—and one evening she asked me to read it again, her husband being with us, for she said I read it as thothough I understood it. Yes, and how \"utterly quelled and defeated\" too I have felt to find my strength so much less than my impulses. The poem \"To You\" has been worth wonders to me, so inclined am I to self reproach. Your \"Song of Myself\" I have read over and over again. No poems ever gave me so confident a hope in a continued existence. If only \"the lover for whom I pine will be there\"! How I long to find them here! and do—scattered everywhere, and their very existence makes me long for them. All around me I see \"Of each one the core of life, namely happiness, is full of the rotten excrement of maggots,\" and so in my loneliness when I try to be happy with them all that is true to me comes up plainer. The effort seems to be—honestly no doubt—to conceal \"our real names\". When I read \"You Felons on trial in Courts\" The tears flow like rain, and I think how develish[devilish] I have been to day. I feel imprisoned—I am tied here— but ever hopeful of a release. We have large pleasant grounds—and houseroom enough, but the provider and \"head of the house\" seems ever determined that we shall realize our dependent positions. How easy it is to discover and acknowledge our superiors, but when any person uses a domineering superiority over you, resistence[resistance] seems but natural, and so I hate the one I would gladly love. Hate is to the hater and comes back most to him; June 26th In our manner of living we are hygienists but yesterday we had company for dinner and so to be sociable after the manner of Col. Ingessol, I drank a cup of coffee. I am a good sleeper naturally but that cup of coffee never lost its hold of me until way after midnight. Leaves of Grass laid on my lightstand, and I opened to \"Song of the Universe.\" I read it in a new light. It seemed to me the poetry of SP Andrew's late prophetic lecture before Manhattan Liberal Club. I had already marked next to last verse, Oh! how fast the world moves to me when I read such thoughts, and how slow when I carry them with me among my neighbors. If you have not read S.P.A.'s may I send the paper to you? With much love and esteem I amVery Truly YoursMrs. M. B. Minchen.Carroll City,Iowa. Marilla Minchen to Walt Whitman, 25 June 1884"
