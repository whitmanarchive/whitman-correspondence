    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylum for the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,24 April 1889Your welcome card of 22d to hand this morning. By same mail a letter from W.J. Gurd—he is getting on well with the gas meter and writes in excellent spirits. All goes well with us here, we are having at the present moment a splendid rain which will do a lot of good. The trees are coming into leaf rapidly and in a few more days at the present rate the country will be green. I have the Tribune you sent me con'g an acct. of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Walt, if I were in your fix I would think seriously of going there for the next six months or a year (or even longer, but that would depend) as a private patient. They might do you good (they will have the best skill going) and if they did not you would be more comfortable there than anywhere else perhaps in the world. If you would think well of this I would go to Baltimore—make all the arrangements and then take you from Camden to the Hospital. There is no palace in Europe so comfortable for a sick or half sick man as this hospital would be. Think this over seriously (it is worth it) Show this letter to Horace and talk it over with him (but H. does not half realize as I do the boon such a chance would be to you) Love to you dear WaltR M BuckeP.S. I enclose the cutting that you may look over it again if you feel to. The more I think of it the more I think you decidedly ought to go—RMB.N.B. I do not suppose the expence[expense] would be much more than the present subsidy but if it is we can easily get more moneyRMB. Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 24 April 1889"
