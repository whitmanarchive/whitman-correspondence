    "text": "54 Manchester RoadBolton, EnglandFeb 21st 1891My Dear Old FriendI was indeed delighted to receive your kind p.c. of the 8th inst which, together with that to J.W.W. & the cablegram from H.L.T. greatly relieved our anxiety regarding you. I am very glad to learn that at the time of writing you seemed to be getting over your bad time—\"a bad two months\" & I fondly hope that by this time the attack has passed off & left you in comparative comfortSorry to hear of Dr B's illness. Hope that he has now quite recovered from itThings are going onwith us here much as usual—my time being chiefly occupied with my profession at work, with, as you will see from the Bolton Journal which I send you, an occasional social diversion.During the last three weeks my wife has been on the sick list—suffering from a rather severe attack of spasmodic bronchial catarrh & neuralgea[neuralgia], which I am glad to say seem to be slowly subsiding now.I presume you have recd the Feb No. of the Review of Reviews containing a facsimile of one of your p.c's & a portrait. I am sorry the latter is such an unsatisfactory one & I don't like that \"foxy\" portrait to go before the English people as your counterfeit presentiment[presence], butit seems to be the only one that the London folks have of you. I thought of sending the editor of the Rev of Rev (Mr Stead) a copy of the one you sent to J.W.W. but he & I think it best not to do so until after the publication of yr \"2nd Annex\" of which it will be one of the attractions.I have secured the copyright of that portrait in this country so that it cannot be reproduced without my permission.Should you wish me to send a copy (?Notes as well) I will do so but not without your express desire or should you send him one perhaps you would kindly mention the fact of its being copyrighted by me.At the next exhibition of my American photographic slides—which will be on Mar 5th on the occasion of the opening of the Photographic Society's new rooms—I intend throwing a fac simile[facsimile] of one of your p.c's by the lime light on to a aft screen. I enclose a copy of it for your inspection.During the last few days we have had mild but rather murky weather—some fog wh: King Sol has struggled to pierce—with a touch of frost at nights covering everything with its beautiful white rim, & the afternon the birds were carolling gaily.Pardon this hastily written letter as I am rather busy & am initiating my new assistant into his dutiesWith best love to you & with kindest regards to all your household I remainyours affectionatelyJ JohnstonP.SAnderton Nr ChorleyFeb 28/91Since writing the foregoing I have received the March no. of Lippincott's Monthly Magazine direct from the London publishers—a favour[favor]for which I am indebted to the kindness of yourself & H.L.T. & for which I now desire to return my best & warmest thanks to you both.Never, in my opinion did the house of Lippincott do itself greater honour[honor] than when it issued this \"Whitman number\" which, with its new poems, new memoranda, now portrait, & new H.L.T. article & postscript by \"the old man himself,\" is a veritable storehouse of precious \"Whitmaniana\"—a bonne bouche which Ihave devoured with eager delight not resting until I had swallowed the last morsel.Oh how good it tasted as I ruminated, absorbed & assimilated it on my professional round this morning!With what graphic & realistic fidelity have you pictured that \"rather large 20-by-20 low ceiling'd room, something like a big old ship's cabin\" with its literary chaos—really kosmos to you—its stove its \"bed with snow white coverlid\"—possibly the counterpane that we sent you—its rattan seated & backed armchair & its \"hundred indescribable things besides\". As I read your words I seem to be sitting there beside you listening to your sweet voice, lookinginto your eyes & feeling the warm grasp of your hand in mine, & my heart fills & dilates with conscious laudable pride at the thought that I too am one of your friends—not by correspondence merely but by personal acquaintance—to whom the \"breath of your heart goes over the sea-gales across the big pond\".thanks & again thanks to you & H.L.T. whose splendid article I purpose[propose] reading to the College probably at its next meetingAs you will see by the heading of this sheet I am writing this at Anderton in JWW's house. He is sitting near me writing the postscripts of his letter to you & H.L.T.Your portrait looks down upon us from its frame over the mantelpiece & I am using L of G as a writing desk! Out of doors the silence only broken by the voices of a few children down the road & the song of a thrush; the sun is obscured & a beautiful soft grey haze hangs over the distant fields & trees.With best loveYours affectionatelyJ Johnston Dr. John Johnston to Walt Whitman, 21 February 1891"
