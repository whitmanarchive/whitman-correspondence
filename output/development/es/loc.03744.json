Life in the main, has taught me as Bailey says\"That all religion can inspire is—Hope—: And all mortality can teach is—Bear\"!(2) To start right again I think you had better send me my MSS—and let me do as I d—m please with it . . I will send it to the WorldWill see you as soon as I get back from N.Y. . .Remember that the friend most solicitous of your welfare at the \"Scovel House\" has always been the undersigned—James Matlack Scovel—I shall never allude to the \"old son\" again! James M. Scovel to Walt Whitman, 7 April 1885"
