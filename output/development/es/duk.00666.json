    "text": "322 Stevens st. Camden, N. J.Monday forenoon July 7. Dear Charley,Your letter came last week, enclosing one from the office. I have just written to the Postmaster at Washington, asking him to forward my letters here, as I suppose that can be done. How is it? Can it be done—do you know? So you are to leave Washington on Thursday next—& Nelly and Jeannie are also—for a New England visit—May it be a pleasant & healthful & happy one for all of you. In my case there is no notable amendment—& not much change—I have irregular spells of serious distress, pain &c. in the head, full as bad as ever, sometimes lasting all day, & sometimes part of the day or night only, with intervals in which, (while I remain still,) I feel comparatively easy—but my locomotion is about as bad as it was—last evening I thought it worse than usual—(to-day it is not)—I am not taking any medicine, nor have I talked with any doctor since I left W[ashington]—nights & sleep are quite good—appetite middling—&c &c.—I still stay here, afraid to go to Atlantic City, or any where, while I am liable every day to these depressing spells—& incapacitated from walking—We have the weather in streaks of hot & cool here—last evening it turned coldish & remains so this forenoon, very bright & pleasant—but we had it very hot here too, some days—By what I see in the Phil. Ledger and N. Y. Herald Wash[ington] items to-day, I infer that William has rec'd the appointment of C[hief] C[lerk] at which I am truly pleased—Nelly, as I suppose you will see this letter, I will send you my love in it, and you must take this letter the same as if written to you—I wont[won't] ask you to write from W. at present in the midst of your preparations—but write me from Newport, after you get well rested & settled—did you see Dr. Drinkard? & did he say any thing new about my sickness or symptoms? I have rec'd a letter from John Burroughs to-day—he & wife are evidently having real good healthy country times away there in the cool uplands of Delaware county—he is home—I am feeling comparatively comfortable to-day, & still hope for the best—but—Charley, go in to my office a moment, before you go & see if any letters—tell me if William is definitely appointed—write very soon from Boston, if not before. Walt. Walt Whitman to Charles W. Eldridge, 7 July [1873]"
