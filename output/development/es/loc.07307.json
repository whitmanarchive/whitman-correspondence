    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,4 June 1889I have look through and through the little book, turned evey leaf and glanced at every page, read the little new note added, verified the latest connections and like the creator when he surveyed his new made world I find it all \"very good.\" In fact I think it a perfect book, the very quintessence of a delightful volume. This morning came your letter of 1 June giving me just what I particularly wanted a glimpse of the great dinner and the assurance that it was (as I supposed it would be) a complete success. The main thing now (for me) is to get all the newspaper accounts of it that I can and (as said before) I trust largely to you & Horace for this. All quiet here, very much occupied, no word about meter for some time but have no doubt it is forging ahead. I trust that it will take me East in the course of the year so that I may see youLove to youR M Buckelast f'm Dr Buckesee notes June 6, 89 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 4 June 1889"
