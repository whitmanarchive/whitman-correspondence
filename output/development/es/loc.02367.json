    "text": "see notes Aug 22 1888The CollegeWinchesterHampshireEngland.Dear Walt Whitman: I write to you, though personally unknown, as writing to a dear friend: because, though happy to call many about me by the name of friends, I have no truer friend than yourself: if friendship means the receiving of light and delight and strength from the spirit of a brother man. I have lived as yet but eighteen years: yet in all the constant thoughts and acts of my last few years, your words have been my guides and true oracles. I cannot hope to see you face to face, and tell you this: but you will at least believe it and feel that I am not writing from an unworthy spirit of self-assertion: but that I should feel shame for myself, were I not to show the reality of my gratitude to you, even through the weakness of words—you, whom I thankfully acknowledge for my veritable master and dear brother. You, in your age and glorious approach to the sure future of death—you will know that I am speaking neither empty adulation nor shallow shams. I am proud of belonging to the oldest school of any in England—to the great foundation of the strong priest and ruler, William of Wykeham: and it was under the shadows of the ancient walls of his college, still flourishing through the influence of his powerful personality, that I first received \"Leaves of Grass\" from the hands of a most dear friend. And the help and exaltation that I won from it have been won by many another boy and young man, of those in whose hands rests the immediate history of the coming years—to make it splendid with strong actions and strong asserted truths. It is in your works, as in the great powers of earth and sea, that the inspiring force of no school is to be found: certain to dare all things by the strength of body and soul inseparable. Whether I am right or not in writing to you, I neither know nor care: I do know that I cannot keep silence.I am, in love and reverence,Lionel JohnsonOct 20th 1885 Lionel Johnson to Walt Whitman, 20 October 1885"
