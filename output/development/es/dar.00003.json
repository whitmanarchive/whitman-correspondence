    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington,Oct. 13, 1866Dear Mr. Speed, I send herewith a copy I have procured of the new edition \"Leaves of Grass.\" The price is $3.In the office here every thing goes on much as before you left. Mr. Ashton has been home to vote, remaining away three days. He & Mrs. A. are well. He seems to be busy preparing for the ensuing term, Supreme Court. Mr. Stanbery is quite popular—he is a still, bland, old fellow,—is much at the President's—has left every thing in the office to go on as before.Pleasants, Stitt, &c are well. Andy Kerr is off on leave of absence. All hands join in sending best esteem & love to you.We have had an awful rain storm of five days, raining with hardly any intermission. The water is way up on the base-ball grounds & on 11th st from the Canal most up to the avenue.Tell Charley that I have not forgotten him—I send him my love, & hope we may meet again one these days.To-day there has been quite a rush of Confederate Generals to the office—Gen. Beauregard, Gilmore, & three or four others, have had interviews with Mr. Stanbery.Walt WhitmanWalt. Whitman | Washington Walt Whitman to James Speed, 13 October 1866"
