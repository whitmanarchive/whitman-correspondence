    "text": "8, WEST KENSINGTON TERRACE,WEST KENSIGNTON, W.LondonJune 13/87Dear Sir, From a perusal of your delightful book, \"Specimen Days in America,\"—recently published in England—I learn that you had seen Charles Dickens, among other notables who frequented Broadway. I am preparing for publication a work entitled \"Dickens portrayed by pen and pencil,\" an important feature of which will be (as the enclosed prospectus shows), several unpublished reminiscences of the great Novelist, including recollections and impressions of his personality, furnished by his most intimate friends. I venture to ask if you will lend your valuable aid in promoting the success of my scheme by favouring me with a record of your recollections and impressions of Dickens. So many of his friends having willingly acceded to my wishes in this respect, that I feel justified in entertaining a hope that the nature of the subject may induce you to do likewise. I need hardly say that anything from your hand, whether of a personal or critical character, in relation to Dickens, will be most highly esteemed by Yours faithfullyFred G. KittonSECOND PROSPECTUS. A New Work relating to Charles Dickens, ENTITLEDDickens Portrayed by Pen and Pencil.FRED. G. KITTON,AUTHOR OF\"JOHN LEECH, ARTIST AND HUMOURIST,\" \"DICKENSIANA,\" ETC. THE principal features of this work, as already stated, will consist— First, of an Account of all the various Portraits of Charles Dickens, whether by painter, sculptor, engraver, or photographer, with illustrative anecdotes, memoranda relative to \"sittings,\" and other interesting circumstances connected with the production of each particular portrait. Second, of a Series of \"Pen-Portraits,\" or records of impressions produced by the personal appearance of Charles Dickens, as presented to the minds of friends, critic, and other noteworthy people who came in contact with him. Third, of Engraved Portraits representing the great Novelist at various periods, ranging from 1835 to 1870, and displaying in a graphic manner (more marked perhaps that we can recall in the portraits of any contemporary) the transitions from youth to manhood and age. Some misapprehension appears to exist with regard to the second feature of this work. A few of the author's correspondents evidently suppose he contemplates a work of a biographical nature; an intention which, cognisant as he is of the existing \"Life\" by Forster, he hastens to disclaim; nor has he the remotest intention of entering into competition with that admirable biography. This declaration he trusts will suffice to remove any objection on the part of the few whose \"impressions\" would so materially enhance the interest of this work, but who have hitherto hesitated to supply such particulars as would constitute a \"Pen-Portrait.\" If we could know Shakespeare as we know Johnson, much would be gained. To describe Dickens, and to record the impressions of those who have seen or known him, the writer hopes, is to satisfy a laudable curiosity. That this may be done while opportunity remains is his sincere endeavor. In this attempt he has the satisfaction of acknowledging the sanction and kindly help of members of the Dickens family, the valuable assistance fo those who have been co-workers with the Novelist, the cheerful co-operation of artists and other friends, besides promises of further aid which will be gratefully acknowledged in the proper place.* Some of the author's correspondents have expressed their inability to contribute to his work because they had no intimate acquaintance with Dickens, and had only met him on one or two occasions. He ventures to point out that personal intimacy is not absolutely requisite in forming a mental impression of the outward characteristics of an individual: that, in fact, mere contact will suffice for such a purpose. In such a case as that of Charles Dickens, the wonderful creations of whose fertile brain excited a laudable desire on the part of many of his readers and admirers to behold with their own eyes the magician himself, it is natural to suppose that such curiosity would induce them to critically examine his outward appearance, and to form an impression that would not soon be effaced. As a notable illustration of his meaning the graphic, terse, and vivid portraiture by Carlyle may be given. Having met \"Boz\" for the firs time at a dinner, he thus described his impressions of the young writer:— \"....Nay, Pickwick, too, was of the same dinner party, though they do not seem to heed him over-much. He is a fine little fellow—Boz, I think. Clear blue, intelligent eyes, eyebrows that he arches amazingly, large protrusive rather loose mouth, a face of most extreme mobility, which he shuttles about—eyebrows, eyes, mouth and all—in a very singular manner while speaking. Surmount this with a loose coil of common-coloured hair, and set it on a small compact figure, very small, and *He has much pleasure in being able to include in his list the names of the following special contributors:—Miss Dickens, Mrs. Perugini (Miss Kate Dickens), Mr. Charles Dickens, jun., Miss Mary Boyle, Mr. E. L. Blanchard, Rev. E. Bradley (\"Cuthbert Bede\"), Mr. Percy Fitzgerald, M.A., Mr. W. P. Frith, R.A., Miss Margaret Gillies, Lady Jodrell, Mr. Charles Kent, Sir F. Leighton, Kt., P.R.A., Lady Helena Martin, Sir Arthur Sullivan, Kt., Mrs. E. M. War, M.A., Mr. T. Woolner, R.A., &c. dressed à la D'Orsay rather than well—this is Pickwick. For the rest a quiet, shrewd-looking, little fellow, who seems to guess pretty well what he is and what others are....\" John Forster thus records his earliest impressions:—\"A look of youthfulness first attracted you, and then a candour and openness of expression which made you sure of the qualities within. The features were very good. He had a capital forehead, a firm nose with full wide nostril, eyes wonderfully beaming with intellect and running over with humour an cheerfulness, and a rather prominent mouth strongly marked with sensibility. The head was altogether well-formed and symmetrical, and the air and carriage of it were extremely spirited. The hair so scant and grizzled in later days was then of a rich brown and most luxuriant abundance, and the bearded face of his last two decades had hardly a vestige of hair or whisker; but there was that in the face as I first recollect it which no time could change, and which remained implanted on it unalterably to the last. This was the quickness, keenness, and practical power, the eager, restless, energetic outlook on each several feature, that seemed to tell so little of a student or writer of books, and so much of a man of action and business in the world. Light and motion flashed form every part of it.\"Of a man so various there must be many portraits. The author has set about collecting with a view of presenting to his readers a complete gallery, displaying an infinite variety of touch and detail, by pen and pencil, the portraiture of the subject of his volume. He ventures to hope the nature of the undertaking, and the unusual interest of the subject, will induce those who have not yet enlisted in the service to favour him with their impressions, recollections, or any reminiscences of our favourite writer.
