    "text": "Camden, Oct.October 13½ past 1, p.m.My dear friendI am having quite a good spell to-day, (if it only lasts)—I wish you, in conjunction with Peter Doyle, would go over to my room at Dr. White's, & unlock the big trunk, (the one that is strapped) and take out My gray suit, coat, vest, & I think there are two pairs of pants, both alike. My black overcoat, quite heavy—it is the one in the trunk—Black felt hat, (there are two black hats, this is the lightest, most flexible one—not the big fellow.) The pair of old buckskin gloves, with sheepskin cuffs and do them up in a bundle—I think you can get three or four large sheets of very strong brown paper for wrapper, tied securely with very strong cord—direct plainly to me, 431 Stevens st. cor. West, here—put duplicate directions on—& send by Adams express—I write to-day to Peter Doyle, same request as this, and asking him to meet you at Milburn's bet 3½ and 4, this afternoon—if not to-day, to-morrow, (or next day, or next still) will do just as well, as I am in no particular hurry. Pete put the things in the trunk for me, & will know about them. Then lock & strap the trunk again, & return key to me. There are two locks, both of which this key unlocks. I rec'dreceived your good letter yesterday. I will write promptly if there is any marked change in my condition. I rec'dreceived a letter from Walter Godey, Saturday, & wrote to him yesterday. Walt WhitmanAfter the bundle is dispatched to express office, write me a line—(As I have said, I am in no particular hurry—use your convenience)— Walt Whitman to Charles W. Eldridge, 13 October [1873]"
