    "text": "The Cornell UniversityIthaca, N.Y.26 April, 1886.My dear Sir: I recdreceived your favor of April 13th and the book, which I'm delighted to have. Pardon my delay in acknowledging, due to illness. I'm delighted to learn that your lecture and Reading, in the Academy of Music, was so great a success. I hope you may repeat it for many years to come. Americans are apt to forget their great men, unless their work in this world, is kept before their minds, through annual presentations of it. It was a great disappointment to me, when I was last in PhiladaPhiladelphia, that press of work and shortness of time, did not allow me to see you. When I next visit the city, I shall certainly arrange to have a talk with you, on certain points upon which I have been long ponderingâ€”one especially, that of language-shaping, and the tendency toward impassioned prose, which I feel will be the poetic form of the future, and of which, I think, your \"Leaves of Grass\" is the most marked prophecy. Very truly yours,Hiram CorsonWalt Whitman, Esq.see notes June 8 1888from Prof: Corson Hiram Corson to Walt Whitman, 26 April 1886"
