    "text": "CamdenDec: 18 1889Matters (pretty monotonous of course) are going on with me much the same as hitherto—(of course palpably physically declining)—Rec'd a letter, (I suppose you got one too) with the announcement of marriage between Chas: W Eldridge and Emily Louisa Brown at San Francisco, Dec: 5—(nothing but the printed announcement)—Also to-day a letter f'm John Burroughs f'm Poughkeepsie, where they are all, (wife boy & he) wintering, housekeeping—J B not either exactly well or ill, but has met a bad financial set-back & loss—$1000 or more—the little boy well & growing. Dr Bucke is well & busy—writes me every two or three days—Horace Traubel was here last evn'g as usual (always welcome)—he is well—is a clerk in a bank in Phila—Am sitting at present alone in my den—shall have a good stout currying & pummeling (massage) in a few minutes—a dark rainy day out, with indications of fog—& what's the news with you? & how are matters shaping? I enclose one of my late circulars as it may have a wisp of interest to you. The translation of (partial) L of G. is well rec'd in Germany. So Browning is dead & Whittier is 82—Love & God bless youWalt Whitman Walt Whitman to Ellen M. O'Connor, 18 December 1889"
