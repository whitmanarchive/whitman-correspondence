Pap does not improve very rapidly one day he is better the next worse cannot sit up all day more than an hour or two at any time, I suppose that Ed told you he had paralysis he did not know that he had a left hand for five days but he has regained the use of his hand but not the feeling also the lift[left] foot the Dr says it was caused by blood—pressure of or on the brain + also says that he is likely to \"have another attack at any time\" I have seen pap ill but never like this he cant remember any thing long at a time + seems to be all broken up. I don't know how long Monts family will be here as he has left Woodstown his health was poor so he gave up his position there + has gone out in Pensylvania[Pennsylvania] + has sent his wife + little ones here until he can get a house. The old lady that is staying with me is a sister in law of John Stafford, she is 83 years old is poor + has no home she came here last august to stay 3 weeks has been here ever since waiting for her children to provide a house for her.I am sorry to hear of your Brothers death, was he ill long? it must be very trying for his daughters poor girl she must feel very much alone, Harry was here last night he was well he is going to Camden soon + will call at your place, I will say goodly for this time please write to us when you feel able to—we always like to get a letter from you.with much loveSusan Stafford Susan Stafford to Walt Whitman, 3 December 1890"
