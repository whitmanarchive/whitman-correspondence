    "text": "Oct 3rd 1890Friday's Hill House.Haslemere.Dear Mr. WhitmanThanks for your postal card, we are always so glad when we come down to breakfast and find something there with your good black hand writing—so unlike anybody else's. As I wrote you the books came safely to hand andare greatly appreciated by our friends who ordered them. And that splendid complete volume you sent father—that is a book! You know how to get out such nice editions—there is no one who has nicer ones.We have just been having a party of about a dozen young people staying with us to help in an \"opera\" which we wrote and performed last Saturday. It was about Oxford,showing how some women-students got possession of a man's college and turned the men out. But alas, when the women were once in they began quarreling—some wishing to be serioes and study, S some to have a good time & in the end they all eloped with a handsome undergraduate and the men got back their college. It was very amusing—my part was to dance a ballet, which Idid, in full ballet costume.We have had a lovely summer here all together, with visits from lots of friends—each of whom has brought some interesting word with him.In a week now I go back to Oxford—to Balliol College, for my last year. It is a dear place. I shall hate to leave it.all send loveyours affectionatelyLogan Pearsall Smith Logan Pearsall Smith to Walt Whitman, 3 October 1890"
