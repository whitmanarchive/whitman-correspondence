    "text": "Law OfficesJEROME BUCK,206 BROADWAY,NEW YORK,October 16 1888My dear Sir,Please accept my lasting acknowledgement for the copy of \"November Boughs\" so kindly sent me through the persuasion of our friend Mr Harned.This expression of your goodness I did not expect nor deserve. I sought only thro'through Tom Harned a line from your hand to place in my copy of 'Leaves of Grass.'Tis many a year ago that I learned to love your noble, honest robust nature, and the immortal lines that flowed from your virile and vigorous pen.Your poetry above all others is stamped with intense sincerity and rugged beauty and I love it for its entire absence of pretence[pretense], cant affectation and hypocrisy.If you ever come my way I know a place hard by, where a bottle of the reddest Burgundy may be found that will dispel the November chill of age and make our hearts as joyous and generous as its own ruddy hue.I am my dear Mr WhitmanGratefully & faithfully yoursJerome BuckFor Walt Whitman EsquireCamden NJSee notes Oct. 17th '88also 18th Jerome Buck to Walt Whitman, 16 October 1888"
