    "text": "431 Stevens st. cor West.1874Camden, N. Jersey. July 10. 1875Dear, dear son,I am still here—still suffering pretty badly—have great distress in my head, & an almost steady pain in left side—but my worst troubles let up on me part of the time—the evenings are my best times—& somehow I still keep up in spirit, &, (the same old story,) expect to get better. I have been discharged from my clerkship in the Solicitor's office, Treasury, by the new Solicitor, Mr. Wilson. —I think of laying up here in Camden. I have bought a cheap lot—& think of putting up a little two or three room house for myself. My darling son, you must not be unhappy about me—I hope & trust things may work so that we can yet be with each other, at least from time to time—& meanwhile we must adapt ourselves to circumstances. You keep on, & try to do right, & live the same square life you always have, & maintain as cheerful a heart as possible—& as for the way things finally turn out, leave that to the Almighty——Pete I shall want you or Mr. Eldridge to see to the sending on here of my boxes at Dr. Whites.—I will write further about it—I have not heard any thing from Eldridge, or Mrs. O'Connor, or any of the Washington folk for quite a long time. Have you been up to see Mrs. O'C. Pete didn't you get my last Saturday's postal card? I wrote you one. I got yours last Monday—Did you get the Camden paper with my College piece in? I sent one. —Very hot here yesterday & today.—I don't fret at all about being discharged—it is just as well—I wonder it didnt[didn't] come before—How are your folks at home—your dear mother & all—write about all, & about Mr. & Mrs. Nash, Wash Milburn, & the RR boys—Your oldWalt Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 10 July [1874]"
