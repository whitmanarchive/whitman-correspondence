    "text": "107 North Portland av. Brooklyn, March 22. My dear Linton,Your kind letter came duly to hand. I have been delaying to write you about the portrait in answer—wanting you to do it—& wanting, if I could arrange it, to give you the full price—I will not have the job done by any second-rater, & have concluded to give it up for the present—unless it could be done by you for $50, which, I am fully aware, would not be your due engagement.I return to Washington in ten or twelve days. Is there any chance of your coming on there? Walt Whitman to William J. Linton, 22 March [1872]"
