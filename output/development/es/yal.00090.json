    "text": "Mr. Whitman SirI am in great trouble again and of course must write to you about it. I was in Washington the 2nd and I went to No 34 4 ½ Street and pawned my Watch a good American Lever, for $22.07 which I was to pay within a month but I was robbed of my pocket Book which contained a receipt which he gave me for the wach[watch] now I want you to go there if you will and see the man (I dont[don't] know his name) and if the thief has not already been there and got the wach[watch] I want you to tell him not to let any one have it on that receipt. I will soon be there myself and redeem it for I am going to be discharged within a few days when I will come and see you. You will confer a great favor on me by going at once to see about it. I would like to have the fellow arrested if he should bring the ticket for the Wach[watch] for I had another Stole from me at the same time. Write to me as soon as you find out about the Wach[watch] for I am very anxious about it. I dont[don't] want to loose both Waches[watches] I have written this in a great hurry. write to me soon from your good friendIt is No 34 4 ½ St. Milford C. Reed to Walt Whitman, 26 May 1865"
