    "text": "Kirkwood N.J.New JerseyNovember 2 1877Dear friend,I received your welcome letter on the 31, was glad to get it, I received one from H Gilchrist the same day, he wishes me to come up to his house and go out to the theatre with him on Saturday, but I will not get to go, if I could go anywhere I would come up to see you, but I will have to put it off until next Saturday week, I think, I want to come up and see you so bad but cannot. I did not get my load of cabbage sold, had to leave them with a commissioner, over in the city, I got all wet and cought[caught] cold, and have not been well since, have had the head ache all the time. It is raining very hard there, and when I went out to get the paper to write to you I got all wet and got the paper wet also, you must excuse the paper. I wrote a letter Jo, to-day. I have not heard from him for a long time, I think that I wrote the last letter to him, but perhaps he did not get it, for I put it in a Telegraphic envelope and perhaps he has not received it. I am still with B K Sharp, him and I had a row one day last week, he came in as he always does with some of his fooling and I gave him back as good as he sent and he got on his ear about it and toled[told] me if things did not suit me here I was free to leave at any time, then I cursed him and went out of the office and went over to the Narrow Gauge and found a job, but when I came back to tell him he made up with me, and I the same with him, so I did not go.The folkes[folks] are all well I ballieve[believe], and I feel better than I have for the past 3 days, but not as well as I did before I went to market. I hear that: Elmer was over to see you 2 times and you and him went over to Mrs. Gilchrist's to spend the evening, hope you had a good time. I must close.Ever your true and loving friend,H. StaffordPS write soon Harry Stafford to Walt Whitman, 2 November 1877"
