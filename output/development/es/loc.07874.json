    "text": "CamdenPM Jan: 7 '91Cold & sunny fine out—Ab't same with me as before—but as I just came fm the bath room I wonder'd whether I did not feel stronger than ordinary—even than for two years——probably an accidental evanescent whiff—but it was sort o' good even at that—This is Stoddart's note—I take it that they really intend to make that March L what they call \"a Whitman number\"—Horace is to offer a piece anent of me—his MS is to be ready to-morrowHad buckwheat cakes & syrup for breakfast—they cannot be served better than Mrs: D has them—I am still taking the little capsules young Dr M prescribed for the bladder botheration—wh' continues—the belly-ache & flashes of left-breast-pain mostly departed or lulled. Am sitting here by the fire with a quilt wrapped high up ab't neck, back & shoulders, ag't cold—W WPhiladelphia,Jan. 5th, 1891Walt Whitman, Esq.Camden,N.J.Dear Mr. Whitman:—I have delayed sending you the enclosed check until now, thinking I would have been over myself to see you, but as I may be delayed on account of the unusual press of business, I herein send check for $50.00 in sentiment for the autobiography and for the poem. Please find enclosed proofs of a page of poetry which please return after you have examined itI will send or bring the proof of the autobiography in a few days, in the meantime, if you see Mr. Traubel, will you tell him to please hurry up with his part of the work.With all good wished[wishes] for your good health and prosperity for the New Year,Yours truly,J.M. StoddartAll of these are to go in the March number. Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 7 January 1891"
