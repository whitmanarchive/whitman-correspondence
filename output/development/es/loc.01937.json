    "text": "New York,April 19, 1876. Mr. Walt Whitman,Dear Sir:I do not forget what I am owing to you, and try in every way to raise something towards discharging my obligation to you. But I have been losing, instead of gaining, for some time. I know that sometime I shall have a good business, but that don't help matters for the present. In order to tide over the dullness, I have accepted proofreading outside of my business, altho' forbidden to do so by realists. Without being asked, you may be certain I shall send if but a small amount as soon as I can. You would be surprised if you knew exactly what I have had to contend with in the way of obstacles for some time. I am occupied at proofreading from 7:30 A.M. till 5:30 P.M., with only a Â½ hr. for lunch at noon. My business is in the hands of a first boy, & I attend to my correspondence from 4 A.M. till 6:30 A.M. & from 7:30 to 10 P.M. & sometimes later, and Sundays. I can still do nothing but ask for your indulgence. But my mortification at having to ask you to wait, under all the circumstances, is very great. Sometime I hope to make amends and a personal explanation.In great haste,Yours truly,C.P.Charles P. Somerby Charles P. Somerby to Walt Whitman, 19 April 1876"
