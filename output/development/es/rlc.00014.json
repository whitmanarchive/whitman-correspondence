    "text": "431 Stevens st. cor West. Camden, N. Jersey. U.S. AmericaJan 27 76My dear Rudolf SchmidtIt is now some time since I have written to you, or heard any thing from you. I still remain here laid up unwell from my paralysis—but keep much the same—no worse. I enclose you some slips—those relating to myself, (which tell their own story) because I know you will be interested in any thing about me—and the humorous pieces because I remember you are curious about American dialect & fun literature. As I write, it is a dark, rainy, muddy day. I am to recite a piece tonight for the benefit of the poor fund—it will be printed in the paper, & I will send it to you. I tell you this partly to show you I still take some part in affairs, though I am badly shattered & old. Remember your letters are always welcome to me. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Rudolf Schmidt, 27 January 1876"
