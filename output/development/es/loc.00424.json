    "text": "BrooklynOct 7th /63My dear Walt,The enclosed $10 is from Mr James P. Kirkwood for the use of the Hospital soilders[soldiers]  I will mail you another letter with some more money to-morrowHow goes things with you, Walt? What about coming home? I have not written you very lately, I have been so very busy. Mother and the rest are about the same. Andrew does not get better. I fear than Andrew will never get better. He looks very bad rather a painful case. I yesterday wrote you a letter and enclosed some money from myself, after thinking the matter over I destroyed the letter and shall give the money to Andrew, did I not do rightIn acknowledging the receipt of money from me please state the amount but not who from as I dont[don't] want them to know that I dont[don't] send any myself but I honestly think when I possibly can give any thing that I ought to give it to Andrew. All the rest of us are the same as usual  Mattie and the babies are very well. the little one is growing finely and is getting to be quite a youngster  Hattie is growing up well  I often wish you was at home  I think you would enjoy her very much and it would be beneficial to her  Jess is about the same. He is not very strong, but does not get worse I think. I should like to have one of the old fashioned letters from you, and cannot you send me the letter to go to Davis before the 12th as the steamer goes out thenDid you write to Wm Davis at Worcester, if not wont you do so, and if you have leasure[liesure] write to Mr Kirkwood sometime if you will  I will give you his address  Mr Kirkwood is travelling around the eastern states on horseback and is not very well. I think a letter from you would do him good. Let me hear from you. I will write you again to-morrow.Affectionately Thos. J. Whitman Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 7 October 1863"
