    "text": "CamdenJuly 20 '83Dear friendYours of 19th recdreceived. Thanks for the corrections, & if you notice any more errors mention them to me, as I want to make out a full list preparatory to next printing—I will speak to McKay ab'tabout the 25 copies & tell him I will go security—I dontdon't know of any \"office editor\" to the N. A. Review—I think Allen Thorndike Rice the editor (& owner, 30 Lafayette Place New York) keeps every thing (in reading articles, judgment, &c.) in his own hands—seems to like controversial articles, attacks, &c.—any thing but dulness—yet I sh'dshould say is naturally conservative, respectable & English—he pays well, when suited—he always paid me well & gave me lots of taffy besides—but balked at my Carlyle article (pp. 170 to 178 Specimen Days) & sent back the MSS.—A fuller acc'taccount of that Russian matter is in the enclosed, wh: after reading, please send back to me. The American (same mail with this,) after reading please forward to Dr Bucke. Thanks for the Boston Transcript (I have sent it to Dr. B.) If George Edgar M[ontgomery] keeps on this way he will soon be among the avowed & emphatic advocates of L. of G.Leaves of Grass. The N. Y. Times article of some three weeks since I have not yet seen.I am well—have been down all this month at a secluded place I go in the Jersey woods—pleasant weather here now—The stress, &c. ab'tabout Dr Bucke's book will begin next winter here & in England.W W Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 20 July 1883"
