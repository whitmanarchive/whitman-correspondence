    "text": "BostonFeb 10/60.Walt WhitmanDrDear Sir.We want to be the publishers of Walt. Whitman's poems—Leaves of Grass.—When the book was first issued we were clerks in the establishment we now own. We read the book with profit and pleasure. It is a true poem and writ by a true man.When a man dares to speak his thought in this day of refinement—so called—it is difficult to find his mates to act amen to it. Now we want to be known as the publishers of Walt. Whitman's books, and put our name as such under his, on title pages.—If you will allow it we can and will put your books into good form, and style attractive to the eye; we can and will sell a large number of copies; we have great facilities by and through numberless Agents in selling. We can dispose of more books than most publishing houses (we do not \"puff\" here but speak truth).We are young men. We \"celebrate\" ourselves by acts. Try us. You can do us good. We can do you good—pecuniarily.Now Sir, if you wish to make acquaintance with us, and accept us as your publishers, we will offer to either buy the stereotype plates of Leaves of Grass, or pay you for the use of them, in addition to regular copyright.Are you writing other poems? Are they ready for the press? Will you let us read them? Will you write us? Please give us your residenceYours FraternallyThayer & Eldridge.first proposition of Thayer & Eldridge FebFebruary 10 '60 Thayer & Eldridge to Walt Whitman, 10 February 1860"
