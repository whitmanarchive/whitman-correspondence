In my humble opinion there is nothing so well calculated to inspire a soldier with new courage and fresh detirmanation[determination] and fit him for the performance of his duty under all circumstances; as the assurance that he has the sympathy and friendship of the aged, who by the infirmaties of age are rendered unfit and incapable of sharing his hard life but are ever ready and willing when occasion offers to extend a word of friendly greeting and bid him God speedThen kneed I tell you that your friendship is most cordialy[cordially] accepted and mine freely and cheerfuly[cheerfully] given in return with the hope that this partial acquaintance may ripen into a mutual attachmentThe preasent[present] you sent me I received for which accept my profound thanks With the hope of hearing from you soon I'll close Yours Truly Alfred L. Larr to Walt Whitman, 5 March 1864"
