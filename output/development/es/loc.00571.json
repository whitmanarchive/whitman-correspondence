    "text": "New YorkApril 30th 1860Walt,I was very glad indeed to hear from you in answer to my last, and you know I could not but be gratified to find your business was progressing so favorably,— In accordance with not only your wishes, but my own I went to Brooklyn yesterday and saw your Mother.—I found her alone, Matt & Jeff out walking. Eddy at church, and George out somewhere's else I suppose. She did not remember me at first but as soon as she did she was very much pleased. I had a long talk, and settled the old $2.00 affair of Matts. I came away before she and Jeff returned. Walt, Mother says she feels first rate, is not at all sick, and I think she looks as well now as she did while I was living over there.—There is no news here Walt. The last fight, the Japenese[Japanese] Embassy, and the Charleston Democratic Convention, fill the papers to the exclusion of Every thing else.—Dunn, the ex stage driver is in Boston with that Circus Co. I think he will call upon you as I gave him your address.—If you come on here this [week] Be sure and make it your business to call and see me. Do not neglect it please Walt, for I want to see you very much. Mrs. Cooper & Robert send their loves. Ever yours, In a Hurry! Fred. Fred Vaughan to Walt Whitman, 30 April 1860"
