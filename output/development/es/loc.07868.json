(pretty good, interesting) f'm Addington Symonds—a letter f'm Dowden—I send to both & many others, foreigners &c y'r piece in \"Conservator,\" wh' reads well to me—have not sent my piece to Scribners, likely shall not—the enc: are a letter f'm Kennedy to you, (marked for me to open)—also an old one f'm KI shall look for you Tuesday— W W Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 18 May 1890"
