    "text": "FraRed. af „For Ide og Virkelighed\". Kjøbenhavn, d. 27 Feb 1872. Dear Mr. Walt Whitman.I hereby acknowledge the receipt of your kind letter of 2 Feb, which has been in my hands for some days. On the 5th January I duely received all the three parcels—Your letter of 16th January I replied to immediately on the 5th February. Of course my letter has gone to Washington.The other copy of \"Democratic Vistas,\" shall have; but he understand only a very little English. If the whole book could be translated into Danish it would fall as a crossing lightning over all the controversies in these northern countries. But our democrats—I am ashamed of telling it you!—are very silly persons—, and our bourgeoisie will not buy the book.I am closing in these days my article on you—. Indeed I am too much occupied with you to write you any more. In the final week of March I shall send two copies of our February number by pr post, the one to you in New York, the other to Clausen in Washington.I wish you good days with your mother.Truly yoursRudolf SchmidtSchmidt Rudolf Schmidt to Walt Whitman, 27 February 1872"
