    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington. March 27, 1867. My dear friend,Although your letter I see has the N. Y. post office stamp, Mar. 25, I have only just rec'd it, (2 o'clock Wednesday P.M.)—I have talked with Thomas Harlan—he treated me very well. My impression is, there is little or no chance of getting Congress to pass, at this time, a special resolution or law putting the ruffles on the list of exempts—There is no Committee of Ways & Means yet appointed in the H[ouse] of R[epresentatives]—True, any member could offer such a Bill, & if it had powerful influence, they might suspend the rules & pass it—but there are too many, both in House & Senate, who would almost certainly object—one objection would be that ruffles are matters of extra ornament &c. &c. and ought to pay a tax, if any thing does—Still, I will try what I can do—I will see a few of the members, forthwith—I have one in my mind, I think may be the best one I can get to offer a Bill, & if he is willing, we will try it on—Had I known it when the Committee & House were cooking the Bill, I have no doubt I could have got it put in with the ¶ including shirt-bosoms, &c.—But that's poor consolation.There is nothing new or important with me. I am well as usual, & working the same, (not much.) Love to Helen and Emmy & all.Walt. Walt Whitman to Abby H. Price, 27 March 1867"
